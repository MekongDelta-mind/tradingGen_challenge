(Sep)NOTE: Previews are listed in day orderNORWEGIAN CPI (MON): The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced.UK UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES (TUE): Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end.UK GDP ESTIMATE (WED): A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought.US CPI (WED): Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern.ECB ANNOUNCEMENT (THU): 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%.AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYMENT (THU): participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms.SWEDISH CPIF (THU): July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak.US RETAIL SALES (THU): Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July. While the data set will offer a glimpse on the health of the consumer amid concerns that the economy may slow significantly in the months ahead, traders will also be watching the University of Michigan's prelim survey release due Friday, where the rise in energy prices is likely to have weighed on sentiment.CHINESE ACTIVITY DATA (FRI): Retail sales Y/Y in August are expected to rise by 2.8% (prev. 2.5%), whilst there is currently no consensus for Industrial Production metrics. The data will be closely watched to diagnose the health of the world\u2019s second-larger economy and to gauge the drip-feed of stimulus seen over recent weeks. Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d.This article originally appeared on Newsquawk This article was written by Newsquawk Analysis at www.forexlive.com.", "content": ": The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August.

China\u2019s economic boom prompted a thousand predictions \u2014 that it will soon surpass us as an economic power; that the 21st century is going to be a Chinese century; that America is an aging, decadent nation destined for second place. The hollowing out of U.S. industry fed the sense that capitalism is betraying the middle class. America has a parasitic financial sector, but we don\u2019t make things anymore. Manufacturing jobs got outsourced to China and Mexico, and wages stagnated. These two trends contributed to the sense that America is in decline \u2014 to the angry, gloomy pall that has settled over political life. But it\u2019s beginning to look as if those two megatrends are reversing. China does not look like a growing dynamic power, but a troubled, stagnating one. Growth rates are falling. The unemployment rate for those ages 16 to 24 in urban areas is at a demoralizing 21%. Private investment is sluggish. A forecast from Bloomberg Economics now projects that the size of the Chinese economy will not successfully surpass the size of the U.S. economy \u2014 despite its vastly greater population. The causes of China\u2019s stagnation are myriad and deep: an overinvestment in real estate, the decline in foreign investment as the state becomes more menacing, the decline of exports, the demographic doom spiral. Since 2016, the actual number of births in China has fallen by nearly 50%. But the core problems are endemic to the regime: Centralized authoritarian control is incompatible with a wide-open, innovative, free-flowing modern economy. Industrial policy may look good for a short time, but it ossifies. China now has a plethora of zombie corporations, which suck up subsidies without successfully competing in the marketplace. Open information flow is crucial to any nation; when the state suppresses information unflattering to the regime, then everything is bound to sink into mediocrity. As the Chinese economy deflates, U.S. industry is looking less hollow. America has a net gain of 530,000 manufacturing jobs since January 2017. The manufacturing boom has been torrid of late. Since late 2021, investment in the construction of manufacturing facilities has more than doubled. Much of that boom is happening in the Mountain West, the Upper Midwest and parts of the Southeast. Chips, electric vehicles, renewable energy sources and batteries are being manufactured in places like Michigan, Kentucky, Minnesota and Arizona. What lessons are we to draw from these two ongoing turnarounds? The first is that there\u2019s a lot of resilience and dynamism in America\u2019s brand of broadly free market capitalism. As I\u2019ve noted before, in 1990, the European and U.S. gross domestic products per capita were nearly neck and neck. Since then, America has surged ahead. U.S. labor productivity increased by 67% between 1990 and 2022, compared to 55% in Europe and 51% in Japan. In 2012, I heard a commencement speech by Dr. Atul Gawande that introduced me to the phrase \u201cfailure to rescue.\u201d He reported on a study that found the best hospitals don\u2019t necessarily prevent bad things from happening, but they\u2019re really good at rescuing people when they have a complication to prevent failures from becoming catastrophes. The U.S. economy, especially in the Midwest, is kind of like that. Many of those places have experienced economic decline, but governments and people have shifted and adapted, and they are bouncing back. The second lesson I draw is that Bidenomics is working \u2014 big time. President Joe Biden promised to help America outcompete authoritarian China and to heal some of the economic divides at home. Both those goals are being achieved. According to the Treasury Department, more than 80% of the investment made through the Inflation Reduction Act is going to counties with college graduation rates lower than the national average. Nearly 90% of investments are being made in counties with below-average weekly wages. I know many of you think Biden is too old, but I\u2019d vote for a 100-year-old who could keep delivering results like that. The third lesson I draw is that the right-wing populists are hopelessly outdated. Take, for example, writer Sohrab Ahmari, who argues that \u201cthe state must also take a far more active role in coordinating economic activity for the good of the whole community.\u201d But China\u2019s industrial policy illustrates the classic downsides of excessive state interference. Even the vaunted German model, one of the great success stories of the 20th century, is showing its age. German manufacturing output and gross domestic product have been stagnant since 2018. U.S. politics is dysfunctional, our social fabric is in tatters, but somehow our economy is among the strongest in the world. Our economic competitors stumble and fall; we stumble and somehow bounce back.", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 11:30:33", "image_url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Biden_89793.jpg?w=1400px&strip=all", "source_id": "mercurynews", "source_priority": 2968, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["sports"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "d16448c4c9bd62f536060c5572e02d19", "title": "Brooks: Surprise, surprise.

Open information flow is crucial to any nation; when the state suppresses information unflattering to the regime, then everything is bound to sink into mediocrity. As the Chinese economy deflates, U.S. industry is looking less hollow. America has a net gain of 530,000 manufacturing jobs since January 2017. The manufacturing boom has been torrid of late. Since late 2021, investment in the construction of manufacturing facilities has more than doubled. Much of that boom is happening in the Mountain West, the Upper Midwest and parts of the Southeast. Chips, electric vehicles, renewable energy sources and batteries are being manufactured in places like Michigan, Kentucky, Minnesota and Arizona. What lessons are we to draw from these two ongoing turnarounds? The first is that there\u2019s a lot of resilience and dynamism in America\u2019s brand of broadly free market capitalism. As I\u2019ve noted before, in 1990, the European and U.S. gross domestic products per capita were nearly neck and neck. Since then, America has surged ahead. U.S. labor productivity increased by 67% between 1990 and 2022, compared to 55% in Europe and 51% in Japan. In 2012, I heard a commencement speech by Dr. Atul Gawande that introduced me to the phrase \u201cfailure to rescue.\u201d He reported on a study that found the best hospitals don\u2019t necessarily prevent bad things from happening, but they\u2019re really good at rescuing people when they have a complication to prevent failures from becoming catastrophes. The U.S. economy, especially in the Midwest, is kind of like that. Many of those places have experienced economic decline, but governments and people have shifted and adapted, and they are bouncing back. The second lesson I draw is that Bidenomics is working \u2014 big time. President Joe Biden promised to help America outcompete authoritarian China and to heal some of the economic divides at home. Both those goals are being achieved. According to the Treasury Department, more than 80% of the investment made through the Inflation Reduction Act is going to counties with college graduation rates lower than the national average. Nearly 90% of investments are being made in counties with below-average weekly wages. I know many of you think Biden is too old, but I\u2019d vote for a 100-year-old who could keep delivering results like that. The third lesson I draw is that the right-wing populists are hopelessly outdated. Take, for example, writer Sohrab Ahmari, who argues that \u201cthe state must also take a far more active role in coordinating economic activity for the good of the whole community.\u201d But China\u2019s industrial policy illustrates the classic downsides of excessive state interference. Even the vaunted German model, one of the great success stories of the 20th century, is showing its age. German manufacturing output and gross domestic product have been stagnant since 2018. U.S. politics is dysfunctional, our social fabric is in tatters, but somehow our economy is among the strongest in the world. Our economic competitors stumble and fall; we stumble and somehow bounce back.

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Job seekers in 2008-09 recession. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) Getty Images The next recession will not be a disaster. I expect a recession to begin early in 2024, or possibly late this year, and that frightens many people. But recessions do not hurt most people, though they certainly can be very harmful to some. Employment in Recessions Unemployment rises during recessions, but not as much as we seem to fear. In the recessions between 1948 and 2019, the unemployment rate during the downturns was 1.4 percentage point higher than in the 12 months preceding the recession. The average time spent unemployed increased by less than one week during recessions. Working hours are cut in recessions, but by only 24 minutes a week on average. (The Data Note at the end of this article explains the methodology behind the numbers in this article.) Definition of Recession In assessing the data, we must remember that economists define a recession as the period when economic activity is declining. Once the decline is over and the economy turns up a little, we say the recession is over even though we have not yet recovered all of the lost ground. For some variables, the data often look their worst just after the recession has technically ended. Home Prices in Recession The median and average selling prices of homes usually rise in recession. That\u2019s surprising given what happened in 2008-09, when prices fell six percent by our comparison of the recession average to the 12 prior months. From the peak for prices (which occurred a year before the recession began), to the trough (two years after the recession ended), the decline was a whopping 19%. Recessions are not good for home prices. But prices usually rise over the long haul. Recessions typically slow the rise without turning prices downward. Of the ten recessions for which we have data (not counting 2020), only one shows a clear decline in prices. Eight recessions had home price increases, with the 1990 recession ambiguous.

Keep in mind that delinquent means at least 30 days late. Most delinquencies do not result in foreclosure. Banks write off more consumer loans in recession, but by less than one percentage point. Commercial real estate is even safer, with charge-offs increasing by only 0.6 percentage points. Business non-real estate lending charge-offs rise by a similar amount. Most Recession Effects Temporary In the typical economic model, the effects of a recession are temporary because the economy bounces back with above-normal growth rates, regaining its trend line. There have been some studies finding long-lasting impacts on those people who tried to find their first jobs during a recession and on people who were laid off in a recession. These studies are suggestive rather than definitive given data limitations. The most cited study found the impacts lasted seven to ten years but were not permanent. 2008-09 Recession Was Unusually Bad Today\u2019s fear of recession probably derives from the 2008-09 experience, which was especially harsh. In terms of overall impact on gross domestic product, that recession was twice as bad as the average recession preceding it. GDP declines in recessions. Dr. Bill Conerly based on data from U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis The chart shows substantial variation from one recession to another. For other variables, such as the average duration of unemployment, the range is comparably large. The largest recession increase was 2.2 weeks; the smallest 0.2 weeks. That illustrates that each recession is unique. The underly economy evolves over time, making the likely effects of a recession in the 2020s different from the 1950s. In addition, each recession occurs with unique external influences, such as world oil prices. Policy responses to recession also vary from case to case. As a result, we should not expect any particular downturn to mirror a past recession. But the past does give us an idea of the likely range of possibilities. Data Note: Recessions are defined by the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private non-profit organization. I do not include the 2020 recession in these calculations because it was atypical, being just two months in duration but very severe in magnitude. Some of the data series are not available back to 1948, so their averages were calculated over shorter time periods. Comparison of recessions with the 12 months preceding the recession is done because of drift over time in unemployment and other variables. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn . Check out my website .

That\u2019s our chance, because this \u201clag\u201d means CEFs\u2019 prices haven\u2019t taken off, and these funds are throwing off dividend yields in the same neighborhood they were at the start of 2022\u2014around 7.5%, on average, today. And by being just a little picky (as we will be with the fund talk about a bit further on), we can amp those payouts up to 10%+. Combine that with the discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of CEFs\u2019 portfolios) available across the space, and we\u2019ve got a shot at real upside, especially when you consider how far behind the S&P 500 that CEFs have lagged this year. Equity Sub-Index Returns 2023 CEF Insider When we look at the CEF Insider Equity Sub-Index (a good proxy for stock-holding CEFs), we see that total returns for these funds are just 2% for 2023, a fraction of the S&P 500\u2019s 18% or so as of this writing. Clearly, individual CEF investors are still sitting on the sidelines, nearly a year into the stock-market recovery.

That\u2019s understandable, but it\u2019s off the mark. A lot of headlines about 2023\u2019s strong year for stocks overlook the fact that the S&P 500 is still off all-time highs by about 6% or so. In any event, individual investors\u2019 skittishness is visible in the numbers, with mutual-fund inflows having just recently turned positive after several months of outflows last year and through the first half of 2023. It\u2019s surprising, and really kind of silly, that investors have taken money out of stocks and stock funds in a year when the S&P 500 is up over 18%! It begs the question of how stocks are rising if individual investors aren\u2019t buying them. The answer is that hedge funds, investment banks and other large players have been getting there first because they know the fear of 2022 has caused a lag on investor money coming into the market. And with CEFs, that inflow has lagged even longer, giving us our in. But it\u2019s key to remember that this inflow is delayed, not terminated, making now a smart time to buy and lock in not only CEFs\u2019 unusual discounts but their high yields, too. So, what data is driving those big rich companies to front run everyday investors? Lower inflation, for one, which has reduced pressure on the Fed to further hike interest rates. A topping out and rolling over of rates would, of course, be good for stocks and CEFs. At the same time, the US added more jobs than expected in August, and the unemployment rate rose because more people are returning to the labor force\u2014a positive sign for productivity, spending and, in turn, stocks and stock-focused CEFs. Lower inflation also frees up more money for consumers to choose what they spend on, which tends to encourage them to spend more. These days, for example, Americans are spending about as much on gas as they did before the pandemic, during the economically strong years of 2015 to 2019, and less than they spent in the early 2010s, before oil prices collapsed in 2014. A CEF like the Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG) is a good way to play this lagged demand for equity CEFs. To start, it offers a 10.9% dividend that\u2019s found extra support from the fund\u2019s NAV performance, which has gained 20% this year, nearly double the fund\u2019s current yield. The fund, as the name suggests, is tech-focused, and fast-growing companies like Palo Alto Networks PANW (PANW), NVIDIA NVDA DIA (NVDA) and Lattice Semiconductor LSCC (LSCC) are top holdings\u2014and all are benefiting from the rapid growth of AI. That tech portfolio might have you concerned that NBXG is overvalued, but, thanks to foot-dragging individual investors, we\u2019ve got a chance to buy cheap\u201416.1% off cheap, to be exact: that\u2019s the discount to NAV at which the fund trades now. In other words, NBXG is one of the few places where you can buy NVIDIA shares for less than they trade for, and you get a 10.9% dividend, too. This is the kind of fund that investors can ignore for only so long\u2014and when they come back aboard, that premium is likely to narrow, taking NBXG\u2019s price with it.

Do we really expect all the bean counters at the U.S. Labor Department to calculate ALL the job changes in the month of August at the crack of dawn on the first day of September? Do companies really report, in a timely manner at the close of business on August 31, about everybody they hired and fired that day, that week? As a case in point, the original June U.S. Labor Department report on new jobs was 209,000, but the August revision to the June count was ratcheted lower by 50% \u2013 to 105,000 \u2013 making June the smallest monthly gain since December 2020. What happened to those 104,000 jobs that never existed? If a key data metric can be off by 50% two months later, why report it at all? Why not wait until it is accurate? What\u2019s even more amazing, ADP reported last Wednesday (August 30) that 177,000 private payroll jobs were created in August \u2013 while there were still two days left in August! The media noted that the 177,000 total was \u201cslower than normal.\u201d Well, of course! The month was not yet over. What\u2019s the hurry, everyone? Upon release of Friday\u2019s downbeat jobs report, President Biden repeated what the Washington Post called a \u201cbottomless Pinocchio,\u201d that \u201cwe\u2019ve added 13.5 million new jobs since I took office\u2026. We created more jobs in two years than any president ever created in four years.\u201d But less than a minute later, he told the truth: \u201cWe\u2019ve recovered all the jobs lost during the . We\u2019ve added a million more new jobs!\u201d Amazingly, few press \u201cfact checkers\u201d highlighted the 12.5 \u201cjobs created\u201d gap in the President\u2019s speech. And not to get too on you, but all this brouhaha over jobs begs the question of what a job is. In these widely watched monthly reports, a \u201cjob\u201d can be part-time work, or a temporary fill-in position, or a million-dollar CEO placement. Some jobs are more \u201csticky\u201d and higher quality than other semi-jobs. We could resolve these confusing and conflicting numbers by: (1) waiting until the numbers are accurate; (2) measuring only full-time jobs, with part-time jobs measured in fractions; and (3) ignoring algorithms for seasonal adjustments. To be \u201cseasonal,\u201d just compare any given month to the same month a year ago. The recent drop in job openings probably reflects slower economic growth and the fact that more former workers are returning to the labor force, perhaps due to their savings running dry. However, as the next chart shows, there are still about 1.5 job openings per unemployed worker. (In 2019, the ratio was 1.2) Ayn Rand wrote a novel in 1957 about executives, inventors and entrepreneurs quietly dropping out due to too much state intervention in their businesses and lives, but something like the opposite is happening now, with executives begging for workers, while the mass of post-Covid America is quietly shrugging when offered jobs. We\u2019ve all seen the \u201chelp wanted\u201d signs, and the evidence of closed businesses, slow service, understaffed shops, banks, and restaurants, nationwide. Locally, it\u2019s hard to find workers and now our local county government has chosen Labor Day 2023 to announce adoption of a 32-hour work week. The County will continue to provide the same services it does today. The County is taking the bold step of holding wages relatively constant but reducing the work week by eight hours. This effectively gives the employee a sizeable increase in hourly wages. The press release promises \u201cthe same services\u201d by \u201creducing the work week\u201d without adding new staff. That, of course, is only possible if the staff were previously goofing off for at least eight hours per week. This has been part of what has been called \u201cThe Great Resignation,\u201d of Americans choosing to stay at home, for a variety of reasons. According to SHRM (August 16, 2023), \u201cThe Great Resignation\u2019s impact on states is continuing to develop, as ongoing elevated quit-levels have led to increased job openings.\u201d Earlier, I asked, \u201cWhat is a Job?\u201d since my 11-year-old grandson asked me over the Labor Day weekend why fathers move their families away from home, from city to city, \u201cjust to change jobs.\u201d I used that opportunity to explain the difference between jobs and careers. A job is something to put food on the table and pay the rent, but a career is a passion you follow. Even though my father, like so many in his era, worked for one big firm for 35 years, Boeing\u2019s mission in 1962, moved from defense and airliners to fulfill JFK\u2019s mandate to put a man on the moon, so dad made a jarring move from Seattle to Alabama. Early jobs aren\u2019t necessarily careers, but they serve as necessary stepping-stones to learn basic skills. In the 1970s, two books helped me plot a career when I felt trapped in dead-end jobs: \u201cWhat Color Is Your Parachute?\u201d by Richard Bolles was the most helpful. Bolles asks only three questions: What do you want to do? Where do you want to do it? and: With whom do you want to do it? The answers flowed freely (to me) from the guidance in that book. Then, to convince company owners I was their man, Carl R. Boll\u2019s \u201cExecutive Jobs Unlimited\u201d convinced me that resumes were fodder for wastebaskets, but targeted letters were catnip. Once you meet one influential employer, the rest is reputation and references among peers. The word \u201cjobs\u201d reminds me of tasks I don\u2019t want to do, like weeding or taking out the trash. Economists treat the word \u201cjobs\u201d like \u201ccredit cards\u201d or \u201cTVs\u201d or \u201cphones,\u201d something everyone is supposed to have, but something that is only measured as a means to their end of \u201cfull employment.\u201d It\u2019s no wonder people want to quit or reduce their hours to 32, so they can binge-watch a new series on their 72-inch HDTV. But a career is doing what you want to do each day. In that case, you never have to \u201cwork\u201d a day in your life.

In a matter of weeks, however, the Census Bureau is poised to reveal that child poverty rates from 2021 to 2022, likely climbing back to their pre-COVID levels. What lessons should policymakers have learned from COVID-19 for maintaining low child poverty rates moving forward? This is the core question I ask in \u201c ,\u201d and I emphasize three of the many lessons here. First, if Congress wishes to get back to its record-low child poverty rate, it should return to the policy that made it possible: the expanded Child Tax Credit that, in 2021, provided cash payments to nearly all families with children regardless of parents\u2019 employment status. The consequences of the temporary CTC expansion were vast: it immediately cut monthly child poverty rates by around , contributed to the record-low child poverty rate in 2021, temporarily brought the U.S. child poverty rate in line with , had the American welfare state cutting child poverty , cut food hardship among families with children by , had no meaningful short-run consequences for , and increased low-income families\u2019 at child care centers and grocery stores. The pandemic not only provided evidence on which policies work to reduce children\u2019s exposure to poverty, but also the urgency of doing so: at the start of 2020, the average Black adult who was in poverty had also spent 57 percent of her childhood in poverty, compared to 20 percent for the average White adult in poverty. These disparate experiences of poverty, accumulating from birth onward, contributed directly to racial/ethnic disparities in health and employment outcomes at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cumulative exposure to poverty from childhood onward helps to explain why adults in the highest poverty counties in the U.S. had a COVID-related death rate nearly twice that of adults in the lowest-poverty counties, equivalent to the gaps in death rates between Germany and Romania in the EU. Poverty, after all, is not merely a point-in-time state, but an economic condition that, once experienced, often lingers throughout one\u2019s life, inflicting costs that range from poorer health conditions to reduced long-run economic opportunity. The 2021 CTC expansion worked in reducing those costs, but its discontinuation ensures that child poverty is poised to rise again. Second, if cross-party compromise is necessary to achieve an expanded, 2021-like CTC, then Democrats should be ready to to trade-in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.\u201cWelfare,\u201d as the program is commonly known, provided very little direct support for families during the pandemic: cash support from ; the expanded CTC, in contrast, cut child poverty rates by 44 percent the next year \u2014 15 times the magnitude of TANF. Meanwhile, state governments target toward Black families relative to White families, exacerbating racial differences in poverty targets. And TANF itself is shrinking each year: the program\u2019s annual funding level is not updated for inflation, ensuring that its overall cost, and also its trade-in value, decreases by the year. There are costs to abandoning TANF, but should the political balance of Congress require that it need to identify cost offsets in order to fund an expanded CTC at 2021 benefit levels, TANF should not be excluded from consideration. A third lesson: Congress should Invest more resources into the Census Bureau\u2019s data-collection capabilities to better track, in close to real-time, the well-being of households across the country. The pandemic revealed that our public data infrastructure is not prepared to inform month-to-month trends in poverty and hardship. As a result, researchers like me have had to get creative to track poverty on a , to measure exposure to across the country, and more. But knowledge of how low-income households are faring on a month-to-month basis should not be a result of researchers\u2019 data innovations; instead, adding four questions \u2013 one each on total resources received during the prior month, food insufficiency, mental health, and housing hardship \u2013 to the Census Bureau\u2019s and Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 monthly household surveys would offer representative and real-time measures of the well-being of the nation moving forward. The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us the importance of having timely and comprehensive data on poverty and well-being to guide policymaking decisions; these small changes would allow for that beyond the pandemic. There are several other key policy lessons that emerge from COVID-19 and that \u201c \u201d elaborates on. To name a few: we should learn from the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and expand access to Unemployment Insurance (UI) among jobless adults, even before prioritizing UI benefit increases. We should build the administrative capacity to convert the Paycheck Protection Program into a targeted work-sharing program. And we should convert some lump-sum, refundable tax credits to monthly payments to better help households with their everyday needs. The COVID-19 pandemic offered many lessons for improving economic well-being in the U.S. beyond the pandemic. We witnessed the menacing consequences of poverty, but also the enormous power and capability of the state to reduce poverty and improve well-being among households going through difficult times. To not apply these lessons moving forward would be a detriment to all those who happen to experience life in low-income America.", "pubDate": "2023-09-08 22:30:00", "image_url": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/ca_childtaxcredit_ap.jpg?w=900", "source_id": "thehill", "source_priority": 393, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["politics"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "b0fed3e22771a3ba370507c43abb1bbd", "title": "How to Manage Your Student Loans After a Layoff", "link": "https://www.postguam.com/news/national/how-to-manage-your-student-loans-after-a-layoff/article_ce0b7915-03e7-5a78-9414-5b8a18dbb31b.html", "keywords": null, "creator": ["Eliza Haverstock"], "video_url": null, "description": "If you recently lost your job and are worried about paying your student loans, you have several options to set your bill to $0.

Though the national unemployment rate was just 3.8% in August, up slightly from July, layoffs continue to hit workers in industries like tech, media, entertainment, fashion and consulting. Nearly 1,000 tech companies have collectively laid off some 230,000 workers so far in 2023, according to tech industry layoff tracker Layoffs.fyi. To make matters even more stressful, federal student loan payments are set to resume in October, after more than three years of an interest-free payment pause that began in March 2020. \u201cDon't feel bad if you have to make tough choices and reprioritize,\u201d says Scott Stark, a senior financial planner at Financial Finesse, a workplace financial wellness company. Here\u2019s how you can make your student loans fit into your budget as you get back on your feet. Check your budget and spending to see where you can cut back. \u201cIt's crucial to get an accurate sense of your essential expenses and rank them in order of priority,\u201d says Akeiva Ellis, a certified financial planner and CFP Board ambassador. \u201cTake the time to negotiate where it's possible, and consider areas where you can trim your budget.\u201d Student loans often have options for pausing payments that debts like credit cards or auto loans do not. \u201cIt's just about staying afloat until you get that next job,\u201d says John McCafferty, director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines, a financial advisory firm. After a layoff, reach out to your student loan servicer or lender to learn about what assistance may be available to you, says McCafferty. Your can walk you through relief options and their implications, help you update your payment amounts if you\u2019re on an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan and answer other questions you may have. Here are some specific relief options that could be available to you. An is the best option for most borrowers who lose their jobs because monthly bills are capped at a certain percentage of your . If your income disappears, your payments should drop to $0 per month. You can sign up for an IDR plan at any time, including after a layoff. Even if you\u2019re already on an IDR plan, you\u2019ll need to submit a new IDR application to update your income post-layoff. The application will ask why you\u2019re submitting it; write that you are submitting early because you want your servicer to recalculate your payment immediately. You only need to once a year. If you qualify for $0 payments, that\u2019ll last until your next recertification deadline, even if you get a new job sooner. This can give you some extra breathing room as you catch up on other bills. A is a good option to explore. The income threshold to qualify for $0 payments is more generous under SAVE than other IDR plans at about $32,800 for a household of one. And unlike other IDR plans or some unemployment deferments, unpaid interest will not build if you\u2019re on the SAVE plan, which could save you a lot of money in the long run. From Oct. 1, 2023, to Sept. 30, 2024, borrowers who don\u2019t make payments won\u2019t be penalized under a including no defaults, decreased credit scores or garnished paychecks. However, this is not an extension of the payment pause. But if you lose your job during the on-ramp, you can skip payments if needed without signing up for a deferment or forbearance. The on-ramp is automatic, so it will kick in even if you simply don\u2019t pay your student loan bill. The on-ramp isn\u2019t for everyone, Stark says. Interest will still accrue, increasing the amount you may eventually pay back, and payments are still due. Pay your bills if you can, either under an IDR plan or another repayment plan. Once the on-ramp expires in late 2024, borrowers who lose their source of income may need to consider other options. Borrowers can pause payments for up to three years with a . This route could be helpful for borrowers who are receiving unemployment benefits or actively job-hunting, says Ellis. However, depending on the type of federal loan you have, a deferment could increase the amount of interest you\u2019ll eventually pay. If you have subsidized or Perkins loans and don\u2019t want to sign up for SAVE, an unemployment deferment might be a better option than the on-ramp because subsidized loans don\u2019t accrue interest during a deferment. However, if you have unsubsidized or parent or grad PLUS loans and don\u2019t want to sign up for SAVE, the on-ramp may be better. Interest will build on these types of loans during deferment, and if you don't pay the interest as it accrues, it will be capitalized after your deferment period ends, which means it will be added to your loan principal. This could increase the total amount you'll repay over the life of your loan since you\u2019ll be paying interest on a larger principal sum. But with the on-ramp, interest won\u2019t capitalize. Private student loans offer fewer protections for unemployed borrowers than their federal counterparts. Your options will depend on your loan terms and lender. For example, private student loan lenders Ascent and FundingU offer hardship forbearances, limited to 24 months over the life of your loan. Interest will accrue during your forbearance and capitalize after the period ends, and your repayment term will be extended. To see what help is available after a layoff, like a temporary deferment or forbearance, contact your private student loan lender directly. \u201cAlways remember, whether federal or private, that communication with your loan servicers is key,\u201d says Ellis. \u201cThey're there to help you navigate these challenging times.\u201d The article How to Manage Your Student Loans After a Layoff originally appeared on NerdWallet.", "pubDate": "2023-09-08 22:27:18", "image_url": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postguam.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/55/5559e73b-66c2-50a7-b836-e0c6043bee9f/64fb7d489f097.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200", "source_id": "postguam", "source_priority": 93374, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "690cb9af40991c82f6849923dcfec1ac", "title": "Greece hopes for investment boost after key credit rating upgrade", "link": "https://qz.com/greece-hopes-for-investment-boost-after-key-credit-rati-1850820255", "keywords": null, "creator": ["AP News"], "video_url": null, "description": "ATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 A major international agency on Friday upgraded Greece\u2019s credit rating to investment grade, a move that is expected to boost investor confidence in the formerly bailout-dependent country.Read more...", "content": "ATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 A major international agency on Friday upgraded Greece\u2019s credit rating to investment grade, a move that is expected to boost investor confidence in the formerly bailout-dependent country.
