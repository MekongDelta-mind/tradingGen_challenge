The IPO venue may seem surprising, but not when you consider the Duluth, Minnesota-based company's atypical ownership: the Chinese government. The state-owned Chinese company that took control of Cirrus in 2011 has presided over a period of stability, including the successful launch of a new jet business. However, the company, aerospace giant AVIC, is on a U.S. government investment sanctions list aimed at companies linked to China's military. Two AVIC-controlled companies related to Cirrus are on a separate U.S. export control list due to their Chinese military association. Heightened tensions between China and the U.S. have so far had \"minimal\" impact on Cirrus, the company noted in its IPO filing. Still, it said an \"escalation in geopolitical tension ... could lead to a material adverse effect on our business.\" It's questionable whether a Chinese buyout of Cirrus would even be approved nowadays given the increasingly tense relations between the United States and China, analysts said. \"If a similar deal was brought [forward] today, there would be a lot more political barriers,\" Charlie Vest, associate director at Rhodium Group, a New York-based research and company. \"These are very different times in the relationship between the U.S. and China and the political dynamics of Chinese investments in the U.S. have changed.\" AVIC would ultimately still control Cirrus after the IPO, which aims to sell up to 20% of the company and raise roughly $200 million to $400 million. However, Zean Nielsen, the company's CEO, said Cirrus is operationally independent of its shareholders. He called Chinese government ownership \"just one of those things that just is. It doesn't really change how I run the company.\" \"My job is to take care of customers and employees the best I know how,\" he said. Cirrus readily complies with federal rules on Chinese investment in the U.S., he said. \"All the things we need to disclose, we happily do.\" Cirrus has been on a hot streak since Nielsen, a former Tesla executive, became CEO in 2019. The company's revenue grew from $586 million in 2020 to $894 million last year, while its profits more than doubled, according to its June IPO filing. Cirrus has a backlog of over 1,400 aircraft, which will keep its Duluth manufacturing plant busy. Cirrus' success has been good for Duluth. It's one of the city's largest employers with 1,588 workers \u2014 the majority in manufacturing and engineering. This month, the company expects to complete a new $20 million innovation center at its Duluth International Airport campus, freeing up about 75,000 square feet for manufacturing. Proceeds from the IPO will be used to further bolster manufacturing; expand Cirrus' growing services business; and invest in new technology, including more automation. \"We will continue to make flying a Cirrus easier and easier,\" Nielsen said. Cirrus is the leading U.S. maker of single-engine piston planes, and its SF Vision jet \u2014 launched in 2016 \u2014 has been a hit. The company has delivered 475 jets, including 90 in 2022, its best production year yet. Jets account for about 30 % of Cirrus' sales. \"They are playing to a niche where no one else plays,\" said Brian Foley, an aviation analyst. Cirrus essentially created a market for a single-engine jet. It's slower than a twin-engine jet, but its price point is considerably lower. The Cirrus jet goes for about $3.25 million, while the next cheapest jet in the market is a twin-engine Embraer model priced at $5 million, analysts say. AVIC's ultimate ownership was crucial in developing the jet, which had been on the drawing board since the 2000s. \"Without them, the SF50 probably wouldn't have happened,\" said Bruce McClelland, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group. \"Chinese investment got [Cirrus] over the hump to launch the aircraft.\" Indeed, Chinese investment rescued Cirrus. The aviation industry tanked after the 2008 global financial meltdown and Cirrus was in deep trouble. \"They simply ran out of money, and that is how China came into play,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst. AVIC's general aviation subsidiary paid $210 million for Cirrus and got the blessing of the U.S. Treasury Department's committee on foreign investment, which reviews deals for national security concerns. But in recent years, sentiment against Chinese investment in the United States has risen. Take the recent fate of a $700 million corn mill planned for Grand Forks, N.D. The mill proposed by Fufeng Group, a privately owned Chinese company, at first won state and local government support, hailed as an economic plum. But some local citizens began protesting the mill, including its Chinese ownership. In January, the U.S. Air Force weighed in, calling the project a national security threat; the mill would have been 12 miles from the Grand Forks Air Force Base. The Fufeng deal soon died. Ironically, Cirrus has a plant in Grand Forks that is only about 17 miles from the Grand Forks Air Force Base. It employs 494 people and makes components that are assembled into airplanes in Duluth. And Cirrus' main owner AVIC \u2014 unlike Fufeng \u2014 has been on the U.S. government's growing Chinese Military Industrial Complex (CMIC) blacklist since 2020. AVIC is a sprawling aerospace concern that supplies China's military, and some of its myriad subsidiaries have publicly traded stock. U.S. investors are restricted from investing in securities of companies on the CMIC list. But the investment restriction applies specifically to AVIC subsidiaries that are also on the CMIC list. The AVIC subsidiary that owns Cirrus \u2014 China General Aviation Industry General Aircraft (CAIGA) \u2014 isn't on the list. In other words, U.S. investors could buy Cirrus stock, the IPO filing said. AVIC owns 70% of CAIGA; the other 30% is held by three state-owned Chinese investment companies. Three other subsidiaries of CAIGA have been among Cirrus' top five customers for the past few years, and two of them \u2014 AG Huanan and AG Zhejiang \u2014 have been on the U.S. \"military end user\" (MEU) list since 2020, meaning they are subject to export controls. The list applies to military-connected companies in Russia, China, Venezuela and Burma. The three related companies accounted for less than 7% of Cirrus' sales during each of the last three years. Cirrus sells aircraft kits for a version of its SR20 plane to AG Huanan. It's developing a small prop plane \u2014 the AG100 \u2014 with AG Zhejiang for the China market. The plane is aimed at training green pilots. Cirrus has the proper U.S. export clearances for both of its Chinese customers on the MEU list, the company said in its IPO filing. The AG100 agreement with AG Zhejiang allows Cirrus to market a similar plane called the SR10 in the United States. But Cirrus doesn't have the incentive to do so right now, Nielsen said. Cirrus' prop planes are already used for training. China, on the other hand, has only a tiny civil aviation industry. Its airspace is restricted. The AG100 would be used by flight schools and is aimed at training commercial pilots, Nielsen said, and it's not intended for military use. Still, the AG 100 could conceivably be used for basic military training. After all, the U.S. Air Force uses Cirrus prop planes for training. \"If you are starting from the ground up \u2014 training military pilots \u2014 you do it in planes like this,\" said aviation industry analyst McClelland. However, analysts say it's generally hard to see military uses for Cirrus' products. Cirrus is far from the only U.S. aviation business that caught China's eye. Indeed, Aboulafia noted that before U.S.-Chinese tensions rose, several prominent U.S. aerospace companies entered joint ventures with Chinese companies \u2014 including with AVIC. \"They probably wouldn't be approved today, but no one wants to kill them now,\" Aboulafia said.", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 14:00:00", "image_url": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postguam.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/ac/3ac85994-4ebc-11ee-b5ad-13755b65d413/64fbef917e4fc.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200", "source_id": "postguam", "source_priority": 93374, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["business"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "862bf1b9190c47d83de6db2cc43c568b", "title": "UN atomic watchdog warns of threat to nuclear safety as fighting spikes near plant in Ukraine", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/atomic-watchdog-warns-threat-nuclear-safety-fighting-spikes-103050313", "keywords": ["International"], "creator": null, "video_url": null, "description": "The United Nations atomic watchdog has warned of a potential threat to nuclear safety due to a spike in fighting near Europe\u2019s largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine, whose forces continued pressing their counteroffensive", "content": "The United Nations atomic watchdog warned of a potential threat to nuclear safety due to a spike in fighting near Europe\u2019s largest nuclear power plant in , whose forces continued pressing their counteroffensive on Saturday.

Joe Biden's administration has some important successes \u2014 a few of them even \"bipartisan\" \u2014 but the political system seems unable to gain substantial traction on a wide array of dire problems. Climate change, voter suppression, reproductive rights, gun violence \u2014 all these afflictions fester while Republicans flog Hunter Biden and fulminate, with no apparent irony, about the Biden \"crime family.\" If we reach for a clich\u00e9 to describe this situation, we might alight on \"fiddling while Rome burns\" as a natural candidate, especially if our focus is on global warming. But fiddling is an activity that requites actual effort; this obstinate stasis in the face of existential challenges is an outrageously perverse refusal of action, undertaken simply because Republican politicians consider it to be in their political self-interest. In other words, the parlous state of American democracy is deeply rooted in the ongoing crisis of the Republican Party, a crisis that has been unfolding in real time for at least sixty years now. The seed of this crisis, the dark singularity from which it bloomed, was the decision by GOP leaders to pursue the support of white Southerners repulsed by the Democratic Party's embrace of the Civil Rights Movement in the nineteen-sixties. These voters, who had generally shunned Republicans since the hated Lincoln broke the Confederacy, were not a natural fit for the GOP as it existed in those years. A party with historical ties to the capitalist class and the aspirational bourgeoisie, it suddenly found itself inundated by millions of working-class voters whose instincts did not always align with its more traditional audience. To secure the long-term loyalty of these voters\u2014- and to cement a tectonic shift in the American party system\u2014- it needed to show them that their new electoral house was in fact a home. The forward-facing, commercial ethos of the old GOP would have to accommodate itself to the atavistic, Lost Cause-nostalgia of the American South. Individual rights would have to make room for states' rights; optimism for pessimism; a republic of consumers for an apartheid state; capitalism for feudalism. We need your help to stay independent Subscribe today to support Salon's progressive journalism Republican success in squaring this circle cannot be denied: Beginning with Richard Nixon in 1968, their presidential nominees won five of the next six elections and states across the South and Midwest gradually came under GOP control. But it came at a price, one paid in two different coins. The first was demographic. The darker, harsher rhetoric the party used to succor its new Southern voters struck some old-line adherents as shrill and extreme; over time, they drifted away from the GOP and ended up as Democrats or Independents. In 1944, the year FDR won his fourth term as president, 38% of Americans identified as Republicans; by 2022, that number had dropped to 28%. This demographic cost had ideological consequences. The voters who left were not interchangeable with the ones who stayed. The \"conservatism\" of the old GOP, anchored then in the small towns and cities of the North and Midwest, was really a form of classical, laissez-faire liberalism. It saw public life as transactional, and wanted a state large enough to facilitate those transactions but too small to interfere with them. (In this it inherited the interest of its ancestor, the Whig Party, in \"internal improvements\"\u2014- that is, economic infrastructure.) The post-1964 GOP evolved into a party whose electoral capital is invested in the rural and exurban spaces of the South. (The Party also dominates in some Western states, but they are too sparsely populated to provide much political heft.) Here \"conservatism\" has a much different connotation: it signals a social vision based on hierarchy and exclusion, on the idea that some people, simply by virtue of their identities , are not suited for citizenship. Its politics is not transactional, but existential. It sees social life as a kind of guerilla war in which the \"real\" America must constantly defend itself against outsiders and usurpers who seek to overwhelm it. The burdens of liberal selfhood\u2014 of accepting the presence of creeds, conduct, and beliefs that strike you as absurd, of agreeing to be ruled (depending on the election results) by people whose lives you cannot fathom \u2014 are not easily borne. Donald Trump, with his thinly veiled bigotry and misogyny, is the tribune of this Republican Party. But he did not invent it; he merely inherited it. With the feral insight of a born grifter, he saw very clearly what GOP mandarins by 2016 were unable to see, or at least admit: that their political choices had delivered the Party to voters disgusted and appalled by the very existence of certain kinds of people. It is this sense of threat and dread, this deeply personal shuddering from difference, that I want to explore in what follows. Doing so, I hope, will help us understand the central fact about American politics at this time: how one of our major political parties sold itself to a virulent strain of irrationalism. Liberalism has, to put it bluntly, driven many Republicans insane. But why? ****** Western liberalism arose as a response to two different aspects of modern history: the Protestant Reformation in the sixteenth century and the absolute monarchies that emerged as commercial and demographic change dissolved the feudal world of medieval Europe. These developments, of course, differed greatly in their sources and details, but liberalism's relation to them was roughly the same. In the religious realm, it came to stand for toleration and a removal of sectarian passions from public life. In politics, it sought to replace arbitrary monarchical regimes with representative governments in which power was dispersed and limited by law. The effect, in both cases, was to shelter difference and to accept a public sphere in which plurality was preferred to a coercive unity. Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter , Crash Course. This attempt \u2014 to trade social complexity for social peace \u2014 struck many as doomed to failure. Civilized life is largely life lived with strangers. Critics of liberalism, such as the French authoritarian Joseph de Maistre, drew the necessary conclusion that social peace depends on our ability to cooperate with strangers. But this could only happen, they argued, when we share certain \"essential\" features with them, including a religiously-informed fear of punishment. We might not know our rulers (or many of our fellow citizens) personally, but we could coexist with them on the basis of these common traits and the social trust they create. In their eyes, the liberal quest to conjure political order out of pluralism was quixotic at best and dangerously demented at worst. What modern forms of anti-liberalism such as fascism add to this is more of a tweak than a novelty. For de Maistre and his ilk were always disingenuous in arguing as if their main concern was order and only secondarily who gets to impose it. Definite ideas about who deserves to exercise authority are always in the background of this kind of view; fascism's only contribution was to move it into the foreground. Whether it's defined in cultural/national terms, as in Mussolini's Italy, or in predominantly racial terms, as in Hitler's Germany, the point is always the same: There is some element of the population which, given the specified features, is entitled to wield power over the rest. If they do so, the political regime is ipso facto legitimate; if they do not, it is ipso facto illegitimate. Period. Modern history testifies to the enduring power of this vision of political life. So do the last eight years of American politics. It's easy to dismiss it as a discredited mythology, a remnant of bigotry, intolerance, and hatred. It's easy, because in large part that's exactly what it is. But a credo does not sustain itself over such long periods of time \u2014 especially when competing with even stronger rivals \u2014 without speaking to something large numbers of people find compelling. The demands of liberalism The literary and cultural critic Lionel Trilling is no longer a central presence in American thought, but at the middle of the twentieth century he was the archetypal \"public intellectual,\" a person who work was valued not just by academic colleagues \u2014 Trilling taught English at Columbia University for decades and now has an endowed chair named after him \u2014 but also by that hallowed audience, the \"educated middle class.\" His book The Liberal Imagination , published in 1950, sold over one hundred thousand copies, a previously unheard-of success for a scholarly work. The book includes a famous essay on Henry James's novel The Princess Casamassima . James's book, briefly, follows a young working-class man in late nineteenth-century London as he falls under the spell of a radical organization. Leveraging his horror at the injustices of industrial capitalism, the radicals enlist him to perform a political assassination. But as he moves toward the date of his appointed deed, the young man develops a love for the artistic and cultural achievements of ancien regime Europe, achievements, he understands, that in important ways depended upon the inequalities of wealth he has come to loathe. When the assassin's hour arrives, he is unable to fulfill his promise; he cannot strike down the embodiment of privilege he has been sent to kill because he cannot affirm the broader objective he knows it would symbolize: the death of the social order that enabled the works of art he loves so much. And so he kills himself instead. In Trilling's view, the protagonist's psychology has led him to an impossible choice: He cannot abandon his commitment to social justice, but neither can he renounce his sense of art as something of intense and supreme value. He holds both passions within himself, and his act of suicide is to be understood as signaling his desire for an end to the conditions, personal and cultural, that place these things in tension with each other. For our purposes here, what matters is something Trilling himself does not dilate on: the role of the liberal society of Victorian England in precipitating the protagonist's crisis. The Victorians were, of course, very imperfectly progressive, but their society was visibly moving in a liberal direction. And we can see this in the fact that it readily provided the materials for the experience that drives the hero to suicide \u2014 the experience, that is, of contradiction. The young man looks around himself and sees great wealth side-by-side with great misery; he also absorbs the reforming and radical sentiments the society allows to circulate. At the same time, the world he experiences includes numerous examples of beautiful objects that unjust fortunes have made possible. It is the complexity of a liberal culture\u2014- its social manifestation of visible difference\u2014- that ultimately imposes a demand he cannot reconcile or manage. In a socialist utopia cleansed of ill-gotten gains, or a pure plutocracy without reforming voices, he might have found a simpler, seamless world of less spiritual\u2014- and therefore less lethal\u2014-strain. But it is just this demand\u2014- the requirement that citizens find ways to navigate a social world which will, necessarily, often baffle and horrify them\u2014- that liberal societies must impose. They arise when coercively monolithic social forms come under new pressures that weaken and subvert them. By insisting on a pluralistic regime, they then drive a relentlessly ramifying scene of social complexity. (This is why the late critic Joseph Frank was wrong to argue that Trilling was mistaken in thinking of liberalism as having special connections with complexity.) Citizens must develop habits of thought and feeling that allow an experience of difference as one of the natural facts of democratic life \u2014 not as the perverse evidence of a disordered society. This demand gives the lie to a common misconception of liberalism, namely, that it is an ethic of insouciant self-indulgence, a politics for blithe egoists. In fact, just the opposite is true. The burdens of liberal selfhood\u2014 of accepting the presence of creeds, conduct, and beliefs that strike you as absurd, of agreeing to be ruled (depending on the election results) by people whose lives you cannot fathom \u2014 are not easily borne. They are difficult and strenuous, and the chaos of our own political moment is ample evidence of this. They are, clearly, more than some people can bear. There is a certain kind of personality that is unmoored when it looks at the world and does not see a reflection of itself. And when a politics decides that its main problem is not the management of competing interests, but the very fact of difference itself , then all its solutions must be authoritarian ones. The Princess Casamassima gives us a tender soul crushed by his inability to deal constructively with the visible difference on display in his time and place. Our anti-liberals are not tender. They are, rather, adherents of a social vision that figures large numbers of their fellow citizens as permanent outsiders, as active threats to peace and security who cannot be cooperated with, only dominated. The violence, rhetorical and literal, of the Trumpist Right flows directly from this sense of social life as necessarily and unavoidably coercive. Unlike James's hero, they will not be pointing the gun at themselves when they pull the trigger. Read more about this topic Can't we all get along?

The United States, Saudi Arabia, the European Union, the United Arab Emirates and others will launch plans to link data, railway, ports, electricity networks and hydrogen pipelines across the three regions when they meet on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in New Delhi. Although heavily trade-focused, the plan could spur major political changes. Signatories hope it can help integrate India's vast market of 1.4 billion people with countries to the west, offer a counterbalance to lavish Chinese infrastructure spending, boost Middle Eastern economies and help normalise relations between Israel and Arab Gulf states. The India-Middle East-Europe economic corridor is \"nothing less than historic\", EU leaders are expected to say when the details of the plans are announced. One proposed project would link railway and port facilities across the Middle East -- including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Israel -- potentially speeding trade between India and Europe by up to 40 percent. Pramit Pal Chaudhuri, South Asia practice head at the Eurasia Group, said that a shipping container which today travels from Mumbai, through the Suez Canal to Europe could in the future go by rail from Dubai to Haifa in Israel -- saving both money and time -- and on to Europe. At present the Suez Canal is a major bottleneck to world trade, handling roughly 10 percent of global maritime trade but often beset by disruptions. In March 2021, the giant container ship Ever Given caused a nearly week-long stoppage in Suez traffic after it became lodged diagonally in the waterway. At the same time the plan neatly aligns with several of Washington's goals in the Middle East, and officials say the United States is keen to see the projects take flight. The initiative \"has enormous potential\", according to Jon Finer, US deputy national security advisor. President Joe Biden's administration is actively prodding Riyadh -- a major oil producer and security partner -- to normalise ties with Israel after decades of conflict and closed borders. US involvement could also help mend deeply damaged ties between Riyadh and Washington, which frayed after the US-Iran nuclear deal and the 2018 murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Finer said the public announcement would come after \"months of careful diplomacy, quiet, careful diplomacy, bilaterally and in multilateral settings\". According to details seen by AFP, the India - Middle East - Europe economic corridor would develop infrastructure to enable the production and transport of \"green hydrogen\". It would also strengthen telecommunications and data transfers through a new undersea cable connecting the region. All the projects could also help oil-soaked Middle Eastern states ween their economies off dependence on fossil fuels. Michael Kugelman, South Asia Institute director at The Wilson Center, said the plan could be a significant response to China's much-vaunted Belt and Road Initiative. The so-called BRI has spread Chinese influence, investments and commerce across Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America. \"If finalised, it would be a game changer that strengthens connectivity between India and the Middle East and would aim to counter BRI,\" Kugelman posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u00a9 Copyright AFP 2023.

It is hard to believe that it's been about 15 years since trading in bitcoin began. Crypto has exploded since then, with coins coming and going, not always quietly. IRS guidance from 2014 ( Notice 2014-21 ) says crypto is property, not currency. That means most transfers trigger taxes. You might be using it to pay for a new car, a cup of coffee or paying someone for services, either as an independent contractor or as an employee. But no matter what the transaction, you may have a gain or a loss. Whatever type or amount of crypto you use, the IRS will say you paid them the current market value of the crypto on that day. When you pay an independent contractor and issue a Form 1099, you can't enter a number of bitcoin on the form. You must put the value in U.S. dollars as of the time of payment. The contractor you pay might keep the crypto, or might sell it the same day, but that doesn't impact your taxes. The U.S. Treasury Department has proposed new rules to make it harder for people not to pay tax on their gains when they sell or trade crypto. Starting in 2026 for the 2025 tax year, crypto exchanges are required to report to the IRS and taxpayers in much the way brokerage firms now handle stock trades. The basic idea is that the crypto exchanges will send you and the IRS a Form 1099 keyed to your Social Security Number each year, reporting the total gross proceeds generated on your sales. You already get Form 1099 for many kinds of payments. They usually show up in your mailbox around Jan. 31, for the prior year. And if you receive a Form 1099 but don't put it on your tax return, it usually means that you'll get a tax bill from the IRS asking for their cut. The new reporting rules are not reporting your gain, mind you, but the gross amount in dollars your transactions represent. If you held your crypto for over a year to get long term capital gain treatment on your gains, the IRS tax rate is up to 23.8%. In contrast, if your gain is ordinary, the tax hit is up to 37%. Depending on where you live, you need to consider state taxes too. But how about your tax basis, who keeps track of that? The answer is that you have to. But the IRS and Treasury Department are thinking about this too. In addition to reporting gross proceeds starting in January 2026 for 2025 sales, the crypto exchanges will also have to start reporting your purchase price too\u2014your basis. That will make it even easier for the IRS to send you a tax bill if you forget to report your gain yourself. The new basis reporting kicks in early in 2027, when reporting sales made in 2026. But the rules would reach back only to crypto purchased in 2023 or later. But still, you can probably assume that there will be lots of zero basis reporting as these rules take effect. Is all this shocking? Hardly. The IRS has been after crypto for a long while now, even before 2014. But the IRS has had a hard time coming out with guidance, a hard time training its personnel how to audit crypto, and what to do with questionable cases. What if neither you nor your exchange know your tax basis? Maybe you bought your crypto long ago, and just don't know. Maybe it was a gift from your uncle Joe, but you don't know what he paid for it. Under IRS tax rules, when you receive property by gift, you take a carryover basis, meaning the basis that the giver of the property had. That way, if the person who made the gift has a low basis, you do too\u2014which will yield a bigger tax bite on your gain when you sell it. If your exchange doesn't know your basis, they will likely say zero basis. And that is the IRS rule too. If you can't prove your basis to the IRS, the IRS will assume that your basis is zero. \u00a9 Copyright IBTimes 2023. All rights reserved.

The post The 3 Best Defense Stocks to Buy Now: September 2023 appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "content": "Global defense spending hit a record high of $2.24 trillion in 2022. The Russia-Ukraine conflict and East Asia tensions are influencing increases in military expenditure. These geopolitical dynamics spell a favorable operating environment for the best defense stocks . The war in Ukraine has already depleted arms inventories for the U.S. and European nations. As we advance, these defense contractors will enjoy sustained demand. Thus, replacing missiles and other defense systems will support demand from now on. Also, the Russia-Ukraine war has highlighted the vulnerability of European nations and other U.S. allies. After decades of defense spending stagnation, several Western and Central European states significantly boosted their defense spending in 2022. Meanwhile, countries in other regions are increasing their defense budgets to enhance preparedness. For instance, Japan is increasing its defense spending due to rising threats from China and North Korea. These three best defense stocks are in a prime position to benefit from increasing defense budgets. They supply critical defense systems and services that will be in high demand in this volatile geopolitical landscape. Lockheed Martin (LMT) Lockheed Martin\u2019s (NYSE: LMT ), a Maryland-based defense giant, is a critical defense supplier for the U.S. and its allies. The company develops and manufactures advanced military aircraft. In addition, it provides air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems, tactical missiles and air and missile defense systems. Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 program will be a key growth driver. In 2022, the F-35 program accounted for 27% of total sales and 66% of the Aeronautics segment\u2019s net sales. Given the rising U.S.-China tensions, the U.S. and its allies are banking on F35 fighter jets to bolster their defenses. There are reasons for optimism after the debt ceiling deal met President Joe Biden\u2019s $886 billion request for fiscal year 2024. As a result, the F-35 will receive funding to produce 83 F-35 aircraft. Besides, there is increasing interest from allies. For instance, Israel recently approved the purchase of 25 F-35 jets. As orders increase, revenue growth is accelerating. In the second quarter of FY2023 , the aeronautics segment grew sales 17% year-over-year. The increase was mainly due to a rise in production contracts. Looking at the Missiles and Fire Control segment, sales were flat. While the year-over-year growth was disappointing, the backlog trend was positive. The segment recorded a backlog increase of $5.3 billion to close the quarter at $34 billion. With a record backlog and growing revenues, the company is in a strong position to return capital to shareholders. It has a strong record of shareholder returns, having repurchased 21% of its outstanding shares in the last 10 years. Additionally, it has increased its dividend for 20 consecutive years. RTX Corporation (RTX) Considering that RTX Corporation (NYSE: RTX ) is near 52-week lows, it might be an opportunity to buy one of the best defense stocks. After announcing its second-quarter results, the stock declined by over 10%. The negative reaction was triggered by an issue with its Pratt & Whitney engines . Reuters reported that RTX had discovered a defect in 1,200 engines. Microscopic contaminants in the powdered metal in high-pressure turbine discs could cause micro-cracks. As a result, the affected engines must be grounded for inspection over the next year. This was a setback for the company\u2019s ambition to conquer the jet engine market. But looking at the rest of the second quarter report , the results were impressive. Sales were up 12% YOY and 13% on an organic basis. The Collins Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney and Raytheon Missiles & Defense segments reported 17%, 15% and 12% YOY growth rates, respectively. Meanwhile, the total backlog was a healthy $185 billion \u2014 $112 billion commercial and $73 billion defense. Net income from continuing operations was 1.3 billion, a 2% YOY increase. Additionally, adjusted EPS grew 11% YOY to $1.29. The company also repurchased $596 million of RTX shares in the quarter. Management highlighted the strong momentum and raised their outlook. \u201cBased on the strong performance year-to-date and strong end-markets, we are raising our full year sales outlook and tightening our adjusted EPS* outlook,\u201d said CEO Greg Hayes. For FY2023, management expects adjusted EPS of $4.95 \u2013 $5.05. Considering a midpoint EPS of 5, the stock trades at 16 times forward price-to-earnings. Buy the world\u2019s largest aerospace and defense company at these bargain prices. CACI International (CACI) CACI International (NYSE: CACI ) offers specialized technology services and consulting to the defense and intelligence industry. It is a beneficiary of the modernization efforts in the U.S. military and intelligence. Moreover, it will profit from the increased cyber warfare as we go ahead. The company provides digital solutions that modernize federal agencies and their IT. The Engineering Services segment enhances and hardens national technology systems to defend against malicious actors. Its C4ISR, Cyber & Space solutions provide electromagnetic spectrum advantage and deliver precision effects to protect federal agencies against national security threats. CACI generates a significant portion of revenues from the federal government. In fiscal 2023, federal government contracts made up 94.8% of total revenues. Over the same period, contracts with agencies of the Department of Defense represented 71.9% of total revenues. Over the past decade, revenues have been steadily increasing, given the growth in defense spending. This growth will likely continue due to the critical nature of CACI\u2019s services to the U.S. government. The company has secured key defense contracts from the U.S. government. For instance, it won a $5.7 billion Air Force Enterprise IT contract in June to modernize and transform Airforce IT services. And in August, it bagged another $2.7 billion contract from the National Security Agency. These awards highlight why CACI is one of the best defense stocks to buy. In terms of valuations, the stock is reasonably valued. For the full year ending June 30, 2023 , it earned an adjusted diluted EPS of $18.83. Thus, as of this writing, it trades at 17 times trailing earnings. Given the stability of its defense business and expected secular defense spending, CACI stock is a bargain.

Amid de-dollarization efforts and the rising prominence of BRICS, some worry that could destroy the US economy. Specifically, as the collective grows in prominence, and takes aim at the US Dollar, the US could be facing certain economic outcomes and obstacles. The US dollar has been firmly entrenched as the global reserve currency since World War II. However, the rise of BRICS has brought a potential end to that reign. With the BRICS currency growing in talks, and many countries worldwide looking to end their reliance on the greenback, the US dollar may be growing weaker. Dave Ramsey, host of The Ramsey Show, recently spoke on the growing threat from BRICS to the US Economy. Saudi Arabia, one of the newest members of BRICS, dropping the US Dollar is broken for two key reasons, according to Ramsey. First of all, he told his listeners, \u201cThe Saudis are probably way too smart to think they\u2019re going to undermine the U.S. economy.\u201d These countries, which represent 40% of the global population, are reliant on the U.S. economy and its vast consumer market, Ramsey argued. Therefore, he says destroying the U.S. would destroy BRICS in the process. Secondly, \u201cthe idea that you can get all those communists to line up and not shoot each other is gonna be humorous,\u201d he added. Hypothetically, Can BRICS Destroy the US Economy? There have been tensions in the , so while the latter point is rather extreme, there is logic behind it. The US economy has reigned supreme as one of the most influential in the world for decades. Hypothetically, a collapse of the dollar would lead to even more inflation in the US. Subsequently, a decrease in its value would follow, which could be dangerous for the citizens of the country. Prices across the country would increase, which would impact Americans already battling inflation. Alternatively, macroeconomic circumstances are already presenting a fragile economic outlook for the country. Along with potential debt default, the country\u2019s financial situation is becoming increasingly volatile. BRICS can be a factor in causing these issues to occur, however, that worst-case scenario would take a lot of time to come true. The US Economy is currently just as much a danger to itself as BRICS is, and it\u2019s unlikely that BRICS is about to destroy it.", "pubDate": "2023-09-08 21:00:00", "image_url": null, "source_id": "watcherguru", "source_priority": 23032, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "b3f900fd6fd03e44c1d13ae0c3e8726f", "title": "US probes made-in-China chip as tensions flare over technology", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-probes-made-in-china-chip-tensions-flare.html", "keywords": null, "creator": null, "video_url": null, "description": "The U.S. government has begun an official probe into an advanced made-in-China chip housed within Huawei Technologies Co.'s latest smartphone, as tensions flare between the two superpowers over technological prowess.", "content": "September 8, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked reputable news agency proofread by Mackenzie Hawkins, Bloomberg News The U.S. government has begun an official probe into an advanced made-in-China chip housed within Huawei Technologies Co.'s latest smartphone, as tensions flare between the two superpowers over technological prowess. The Commerce Department, which enacted a series of restrictions against Huawei and China's chip industry over the past two years, said it's working to get more information on a \"purported\" 7-nanometer processor discovered within the Mate 60 Pro. The chip was made by China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., which like Huawei is blacklisted by the U.S. and restricted from accessing American technology. The discovery of the chip set off a debate in Washington about the efficacy of sanctions intended to contain a geopolitical rival and coincided with a move in China to expand a ban on the use of iPhones in government-backed agencies and state companies. The U.S. has been trying to throttle China's tech sector for years amid concerns in Washington that it will gain a military edge. China, which has bristled at the restrictions, has its own fears about the use of foreign technology in sensitive industries and has been seeking to reduce its reliance on American software and circuitry. Clamping down on the iPhone threatens to erode Apple Inc.'s position in a market that yields about a fifth of its revenue and where it produces the majority of its star product. Apple has lost about $200 billion of market value in the past two days, adding to a litany of concerns over China weighing on major U.S. indexes. The shares were little changed in premarket trading in New York on Friday. Huawei's quiet reveal of a mobile phone utilizing technology the U.S. has sought to keep out of Beijing's hands threatens to derail recent efforts of outreach by the Biden administration. The Huawei phone went on sale online while Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was on a trip to China last week, the latest in a series of high-level diplomatic visits to Beijing. The debate now centers around whether it represents a failure of U.S. efforts\u2014led by Raimondo's department\u2014and has raised questions about whether the main U.S. mechanisms to rein in China, including controls on exports of key materials, tools and knowhow, need to be tightened. \"We are working to obtain more information on the character and composition of the purported 7nm chip,\" a Commerce spokesperson said in a statement. \"Let's be clear: export controls are just one tool in the U.S. government's toolbox to address the national security threats presented by the PRC. The restrictions in place since 2019 have knocked Huawei down and forced it to reinvent itself\u2014at a substantial cost to the PRC government.\" Chinese semiconductor equipment makers soared as much as 20% after news of the U.S. probe spurred bets that the sector will enjoy increased state support. That advance was mostly led by companies related to lithography gear\u2014a weak link in China's chip supply chain and one Beijing is keen to develop. Shanghai Electric Group Co., whose controlling shareholder has a major stake in lithography specialist Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment Group Co., rose by its 10% limit. \"We have always opposed politicizing trade and technology issues and overstretching and abusing the concept of national security,\" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters at a regular briefing in Beijing Friday. \"Sanctions will not stop China's development, it will only strengthen China's resolve and capability to seek self-reliance and technology innovation.\" The Mate 60 Pro smartphone employs an unusually high proportion of Chinese parts, in addition to its main processor, an ongoing teardown by TechInsights conducted for Bloomberg News revealed, a sign of the country's progress in developing domestic tech capabilities. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has said he would withhold comment until the U.S. gets more information. \"There's a number of different methods to try to sort of come to an understanding of what exactly it is that we're dealing with here,\" Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday. \"I can't give you an exact number of days but this is not going to be months down the road. We're going to want to look at this carefully, consult with our partners, get a clearer sense of what we're looking at, and then we'll make decisions accordingly. \" In the meantime, Huawei's new devices have spurred an outpouring of nationalist sentiment on Chinese social media, which portrayed them as a triumph in the face of U.S. sanctions. On Friday, Huawei debuted an even more powerful smartphone\u2014the Mate 60 Pro+\u2014in an online video teaser. The Pro+ adds a 1-terabyte maximum storage option and 4GB more memory than on the Pro model, which retails at 6,999 yuan. Shares of Huawei suppliers soared as much as their 10% daily limit on Chinese exchanges after that latest offering hit online stores. 2023 Bloomberg L.P.
