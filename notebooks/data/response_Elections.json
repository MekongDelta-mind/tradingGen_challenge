As millions of Russians go to the polls for regional elections that wrap up on Sept. 10, there is little doubt that President Vladimir Putin's party, United Russia, will win the vast majority of contests. But the tightly controlled vote will still be interpreted as a test of confidence for the beleaguered strongman, who in late June survived the biggest challenge to his 23 years in power during the Wagner rebellion. Pressure has been building up on the Kremlin since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has upended the Russian economy, not to mention causing the deaths of thousands of Russian soldiers. U.S. officials have estimated that Russia's military casualties are approaching 300,000. The war in Ukraine is also increasingly coming home to Russia, including Moscow, with at least 190 suspected drone attacks hitting the country and Russian-occupied Crimea. In recent years, and especially following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the country's remaining opposition figures have largely been cowed, exiled, or jailed. Critical media have packed up or been shut down by the Kremlin, and human rights organizations have been disbanded. There likely won't be the surprises seen in the last round of local elections, in 2018, that saw United Russia lose four gubernatorial races. Even so, the vote remain an important moment for both Putin, who is hoping to shore up his legitimacy within Russia, and for Russia's opposition, which is hoping to retain their last toeholds in Russian politics. \"The Kremlin is very worried about the outcome of these elections,\" says Regina Smyth, a professor at Indiana University whose research focuses on Russia. Below, what to know about the vote. What's at stake? The elections will take place in about half of Russia, plus the four occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia as well as Russian-annexed Crimea.

(AP) \u2014 Photos PAGP501-504 Majority control of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives will again come down to a special later this month, when Republican voters attempt to flip power back to their caucus while facing a strongly Democratic lean in a Pittsburgh district. The race pits a former Democratic congressional staffer against the daughter of two local officials who were politically active. Democrat Lindsay Powell, 32, and Republican Erin Connolly Autenreith, 65, will face off for the Allegheny County state House seat on Sept. 19, one week before the chamber is scheduled to return to floor session in Harrisburg. They are vying to replace a progressive Democrat, former state Rep. Sara Innamorato, who resigned in July to seek the county executive job. Her departure left the House at a 101-101 tie. The district is a Democratic stronghold Democratic strategists predict their party will be able to retain. A previous special election in which the Republican candidate lost by a wide margin may be why the GOP hasn\u2019t drained its coffers to try to flip the seat, said Trevor Southerland, House Democratic campaign strategist. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a special (election), it would be easier for them to do in a general, but they\u2019d have to be up on TV, they\u2019d have to have an army of field organizers knocking on doors, ton of mailers and digital ads,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just not seeing that.\u201d Republicans in Allegheny County know they are fighting an uphill battle. \u201cEven in a regular election year, it would be very, very difficult for a Republican to win this. However it remains to be seen how the electorate feels,\u201d said Sam DeMarco, chair of the Republican Committee of Allegheny County, adding that Autenreith \"is working very hard.\u201d Powell is seeking office for the first time but jokes she has worked in every job in government except for the one she is seeking. She previously worked as an aide to U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer and U.S. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, both New York Democrats. Constituents say they want more affordable housing, a strong local economy and improved community assets, Powell said. \u201cPeople are concerned about making sure they can stay in their community and make Pittsburgh home, and keep Pittsburgh home,\u201d she said. Several Democrat-led initiatives, such as whole home repair and broader protections for + people, were critical pieces of legislation that didn\u2019t move until Democrats reclaimed control of the state House earlier this year, she said. \u201cWe won\u2019t continue to see this progress if we don\u2019t retain it,\u201d Powell said. Democrats barely flipped the number of districts needed to control the House in November. It was their first claim to the majority in 12 years, with a 102-101 margin they have since maintained through several special elections. Having first-year Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro in office has aided their agenda. This year, Democrats have used their newfound power to advance a number of the caucus\u2019 priorities. But the Legislature remains politically divided, with a firm Republican majority in the Senate that has sought to advance its own priorities, including school vouchers and constitutional amendments. Passing such measures would be easier with a favorable House. Autenreith's potential election, flipping party control to the Republicans, would not change things very much in the Capitol, she said. \u201cI think it would boost the Republican Party, of course, but that\u2019s not the reason I\u2019m running,\u201d she said. Autenreith comes from a political background: Her father was a mayor of McKees Rocks near Pittsburgh and her mother served on a borough council. She previously ran for the state House in 2000 but lost to the Democrat seeking reelection. Autenreith currently serves as Republican committee chair in Shaler. Education is a central political issue for her, she said. Autenreith supports vouchers for private school and said she thinks education is vital to get at other challenges facing the district, including housing and crime. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a shift in this country in the next year or two because it\u2019s hit a boiling point,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to live like this, live to be afraid to go downtown, to go to major events.\u201d The House isn\u2019t due back until a week after the special election decides the fate of the majority, leaving aspects of the final state budget undone. Innamorato\u2019s departure makes advancing measures on party-line votes more difficult for Democrats. Innamorato won a contested Democratic primary for Allegheny\u2019s county executive in May as part of a progressive slate in local elections. She will face the lone Republican primary contender, Joseph Rockey, in the November general election. Another Democratic state representative, longtime Bucks County incumbent John Galloway, is running for district judge, meaning early next year the Democrats will likely face another race in which their majority is at stake. ___ Brooke Schultz is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

The fundamental question is on the table thanks to Mayor Adams . His warning that the asylum-seeking migrant throng \u201cwill destroy New York City\u201d makes this a five-alarm moment. Adams is late to the party with his realization, which should have been obvious the moment President Biden threw open the southern border and the first batches of illegal crossers landed in Manhattan. Why the mayor hesitated to sound the big alarm until 110,000 arrived here, with 60,000 living at taxpayer expense, is beyond comprehension. What took him so damn long? Part of the answer is that Adams is notoriously inconsistent and has been on both sides of the migrant fence. He was initially boastful about welcoming them to his sanctuary city and helped arrange transportation for some with the Democratic mayor of El Paso, Texas, even as he denounced the Republican governor of Texas as a racist for sending bus caravans to New York (at the Port Authority, right) and other cities with black mayors. To complete the circle of double talk, Adams tried exporting buses full of migrants to the suburbs, where most were turned back. Leaders there don\u2019t want any part of New York\u2019s disaster. As for his day job, City Hall\u2019s role seems to consist mostly of opening new sites \u2014 the latest count is more than 200 \u2014 to accommodate all new arrivals. In addition to the exorbitant cost of taking over entire hotels and outfitting other large buildings, there is food, health care, transportation, education \u2014 all of which leads to his estimate that the tab will hit an astonishing $12 billion over three years. On Saturday, the mayor announced cuts to other agencies, saying they must trim their spending by 5% to offset the ballooning migrant costs. His failures aside, Adams is spot on with his warning about the situation and those who care about New York should be grateful for his candor, belated though it is. Accusations from the left that he is fear-mongering are technically correct, but miss the point. Fear is the right reaction to a problem of this magnitude. The staggering cost means taxpayers will get far less bang for their bucks. Tax hikes are inevitable, giving more fuel to the exodus of fed-up New Yorkers fleeing to lower-cost, safer and saner destinations. While it is tempting to give up on Adams, he still has more than two years left in his term to right the ship. Besides, no credible alternative has stepped forward with a plan. Any would-be saviors better also have a plan to fix everything else, too, because the city was teetering even before those first migrant buses got here. Name a topic and you\u2019ve named a major problem. Crime, public disorder, failing schools, taxes, transportation, cost of living, utilities, infrastructure \u2014 the city is drowning. Those with any knowledge of history will say it faced a death rattle before and leaders emerged to guide it to greener pastures. And it\u2019s true that in the last 50 years, Ed Koch, Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg did just that, even though none was considered a likely hero. Even the seemingly unbearable horrors of 9/11 were overcome. But two essential ingredients from those days are missing now. One is a viable two-party system and the other is a decisive number of centrist, swing voters. Republican Lee Zeldin\u2019s failed campaign for governor last year helped the GOP pick up enough seats to provide a slim House majority, but he scored just 30% of the vote in the five boroughs, an indication of why Republicans are not a factor in day-to-day governance. Dems also hold every statewide elective office and control the leadership of all major cities. They have veto-proof majorities in the City Council and Legislature. In fact, New York is such a one-party hot house that the Manhattan district attorney and the state attorney general waded into national politics by filing tendentious charges against Donald Trump . Perhaps most important, the council and both chambers in Albany are controlled not just by Democrats, but by the party\u2019s radical left wing. To survive, more moderate Dems, including Adams and Gov. Hochul , have mostly surrendered to the radicals\u2019 agenda, meaning the center of political gravity has shifted significantly left in the last 20 years. To be sure, Koch was a Dem, but as he liked to say, \u201ca liberal with sanity.\u201d Giuliani and Bloomberg were Republicans, and given the lopsided count of registered voters and the far-left\u2019s dominance, it\u2019s unlikely either man could be elected today. The tilted landscape gives Adams and Hochul very short policy leashes and neither has been consistently able to set the agenda. It\u2019s also true that they have not figured out how to leverage the power they have, including how to get the attention of a Democratic White House about the migrant catastrophe. If a Republican president harmed New York by opening the border and stood silent as millions poured across, they would have raged on endlessly and rallied voters to punish the president\u2019s party. But with a president of their own party, they have been loyal to a fault, complaining only because Washington won\u2019t chip in enough money to pay for the crisis it created. Neither demands that Biden secure the border. Even worse, the mayor and governor united around the terrible idea of demanding rapid work permits for the migrants, and pledge to help them find permanent housing.

Both initiatives, if they were to succeed, would make New York even more of an attractive destination for illegal crossers, thus exacerbating the problems Adams and Hochul say they want to solve. Times like this add to the overwhelming evidence we are being ruled by amateurs, and create serious doubts that New York can be saved. To be clear, the city will outlast Adams and Hochul because most people have nowhere else to go or can\u2019t afford to leave. But the pols\u2019 record so far shows that decline, decline and more decline will be their damning legacy. The next time you hear someone spout nonsense, be patient.

Beautiful East River Park is being destroyed with a thousand 75-year-old trees already savagely cut down under a City Council decree in the name of flood mitigation. There was a plan approved after many public hearings to build an eight-foot wall between the park and FDR Drive. Several months later, a new plan (costing three times the price of the original one) was quickly put into action calling for cementing over all the grassy and flower-filled areas, as well as cutting down all the trees. There was a huge neighborhood outcry while the city denied there was any \u201coriginal\u201d plan. The residents had to activate a Freedom of Information Law request to prove that there was indeed an original plan. Too late, unfortunately. So much for the Million Trees NYC program. It will take more than 75 years to fully replace our park and those magnificent trees.

A study from the University of Michigan published last month found that wildfires, as well as emissions from farming, may pose especially toxic threats to a person\u2019s cognitive health, even increasing their risk of developing dementia. The study from found a \u201cstrong likelihood\u201d that agriculture and wildfires may be doing more damage than previously thought and will need to be closely monitored and studied for their risks to public health. \u201cWe saw in our research that all airborne particles increased the risk of dementia but those generated by agricultural settings and wildfires seemed to be especially toxic for the brain,\u201d said Sara Adar, associate chair of the Department of Epidemiology in the School of Public Health. Adar is leading multiple studies on the impacts of exposures on cognitive aging and dementia. Boya Zhang, a research fellow who studies the effects of air pollution on the body, said this recent study suggests that \u201cparticulate matter air pollution from agriculture and wildfires might be more neurotoxic compared with other sources.\u201d Zhang stressed that more research would be needed to confirm that hypothesis. The research focused on 30,000 Americans who were involved in a previous study that looked into the development of dementia over an 18-year period. Data was provided by the Health and Retirement Study, with participants regularly interviewed to provide feedback about their overall health and cognition. Michigan researchers then took that data, focusing on where the participants lived, cross-referenced it with exposure to particulate matter air pollution, and found that those who were exposed more regularly had a greater risk of dementia. The findings could not be explained by other factors, researchers added. \u201cThese findings are quite timely given the increasing frequency of wildfire smoke in our communities,\u201d Adar said. \u201cOur data suggest that in addition to some of the more obvious health impacts of wildfire smoke like irritation to our throats and eyes along with breathing difficulties, high smoke days might also be taking a toll on our brains.\u201d Unusually poor air quality across the country has regularly triggered public health alerts warning of microscopic toxins in air pollution. Some fine particulate matter is so small it can enter the brain through the nose directly or cross the brain\u2019s protective blood-brain barrier. Some particulate matter is also known to affect the lungs and heart, in addition to the brain. This year saw a record number of air quality alerts in the U.S., propelled by massive wildfires in Canada. In California alone, there have been more than this year with more than a quarter-million acres burned in what is widely considered a \u201cmild\u201d fire season. Adar said wildfire smoke is becoming a \u201cmore widespread stressor,\u201d with many cities experiencing as many as 30 days or more of smoke impacts. Wildfires are believed to contribute up to 25% of the fine particulate matter exposures across the entire country and as much as 50% in Western states. Any new health effects linked to wildfires are extra concerning to researchers as global climate change increases the risk of ecological disasters happening with more regularity. \u201cWhile individual wildfires may be short-lived, these events are becoming more frequent in our communities due to warmer temperatures, drier conditions, and longer fire seasons. As we\u2019ve seen, wildfire smoke can also travel very far distances,\u201d Adar said. The purpose of the study was mainly to provide evidence to policymakers about the risks of exposure to these emission sources. Dementia, which is the seventh-leading cause of death in the world and one of the major causes of disability for older people, could take years to develop, so any evidence of a possible increased risk factor is critical in understanding and possibly preventing it. \u201cWith the knowledge of which sources are more toxic than others, it may be possible to design interventions for specific sources as a more effective way to decrease the burden of dementia,\u201d Zhang said. A similar study published by the found that wildfire smoke could cause inflammation of the brain that can persist for months or longer. That inflammation can be found in the hippocampus, the region of the brain responsible for learning and memory. In addition to the increased risk of dementia, wildfire could also be , researchers theorized.", "pubDate": "2023-09-10 01:18:40", "image_url": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/GettyImages-1008050668-e1694308714757.jpg?w=900", "source_id": "thehill", "source_priority": 393, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["health"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "3e70d802e167a2e2e5dc524f96a96797", "title": "JFK assassination witness breaks his silence and raises new questions", "link": "https://www.startribune.com/jfk-assassination-witness-breaks-his-silence-and-raises-new-questions/600303361/", "keywords": null, "creator": ["Peter Baker"], "video_url": null, "description": null, "content": "CLEVELAND \u2014 He still remembers the first gunshot. For an instant, standing on the running board of the motorcade car, he entertained the vain hope that maybe it was just a firecracker or a blown tire. But he knew guns, and he knew better. Then came another shot. And another. And the president slumped down. For so many nights afterward, he relived that grisly moment in his dreams. Now, 60 years later, Paul Landis, one of the Secret Service agents just feet away from President John F. Kennedy on that fateful day in Dallas, is telling his story in full for the first time. And in at least one key respect, his account differs from the official version in a way that may change the understanding of what happened in Dealey Plaza. Landis has spent most of the intervening years fleeing history, trying to forget that unforgettable moment etched in the consciousness of a grieving nation. The memory of the explosion of violence and the desperate race to the hospital and the devastating flight home and the wrenching funeral with John F. Kennedy Jr. saluting his fallen father \u2014 it was all too much, too torturous, so much so that Landis left the service and Washington behind. Until finally, after the nightmares had passed at last, he could think about it again. And he could read about it. And he realized that what he read was not quite right, not as he remembered it. As it turns out, if his recollections are correct, the much-discussed \"magic bullet\" may not have been so magic after all. His memory challenges the theory advanced by the Warren Commission that has been the subject of so much speculation and debate over the years \u2014 that one of the bullets fired at the president's limousine hit not only Kennedy but Gov. John Connally Jr. of Texas, who was riding with him, in multiple places. Landis' account, included in a forthcoming memoir, would rewrite the narrative of one of modern American history's most earth-shattering days in an important way. It may not mean any more than that. But it could also encourage those who have long suspected that there was more than one gunman in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, adding new grist to one of the nation's enduring mysteries. As with all things related to the assassination, of course, his account raises questions of its own. Landis remained silent for 60 years, which has fueled doubts even for his former Secret Service partner, and memories are tricky even for those sincerely certain of their recollections. A couple elements of his account contradict the official statements he filed with authorities immediately after the shooting, and some of the implications of his version cannot be easily reconciled to the existing record. But he was there, a firsthand witness, and it is rare for new testimony to emerge six decades after the fact. He has never subscribed to the conspiracy theories and stresses that he is not promoting one now. At age 88, he said, all he wants is to tell what he saw and what he did. He will leave it to everyone else to draw conclusions. \"There's no goal at this point,\" he said in an interview last month in Cleveland, the first time he has talked about this with a reporter in advance of his book, \"The Final Witness,\" which will be published by Chicago Review Press on Oct. 10. \"I just think it had been long enough that I needed to tell my story.\" What it comes down to is a copper-jacketed 6.5 mm projectile. The Warren Commission decided that one of the bullets fired that day struck the president from behind, exited from the front of his throat and continued on to hit Connally, somehow managing to injure his back, chest, wrist and thigh. It seemed incredible that a single bullet could do all that, so skeptics called it the magic bullet theory. Investigators came to that conclusion partly because the bullet was found on a stretcher believed to have held Connally at Parkland Memorial Hospital, so they assumed it had exited his body during efforts to save his life. But Landis, who was never interviewed by the Warren Commission, said that is not what happened. In fact, he said, he was the one who found the bullet \u2014 and he found it not in the hospital near Connally but in the presidential limousine lodged in the back of the seat behind where Kennedy was sitting. When he spotted the bullet after the motorcade arrived at the hospital, he said he grabbed it to thwart souvenir hunters. Then, for reasons that still seem fuzzy even to him, he said he entered the hospital and placed it next to Kennedy on the president's stretcher, assuming it could somehow help doctors figure out what happened. At some point, he now guesses, the stretchers must have been pushed together, and the bullet was shaken from one to another. \"There was nobody there to secure the scene, and that was a big, big bother to me,\" Landis said. \"All the agents that were there were focused on the president.\" A crowd was gathering. \"This was all going on so quickly. And I was just afraid that \u2014 it was a piece of evidence, that I realized right away. Very important. And I didn't want it to disappear or get lost. So it was, 'Paul, you've got to make a decision,' and I grabbed it.'\" Landis theorizes that the bullet struck Kennedy in the back but for some reason was undercharged and did not penetrate deeply, therefore popping back out before the president's body was removed from the limousine. Landis has been reluctant to speculate on the larger implications. He always believed that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman. But now? \"At this point, I'm beginning to doubt myself,\" he said. \"Now I begin to wonder.\" That is as far as he is willing to go. A native of Ohio and son of a college sports coach, Landis does not come across as a swaggering security agent. He had to stretch to meet the 5-foot-8 height requirement when he joined the service and could no longer do so. \"I'm too little now,\" he said, to make it in today's agency. He is quiet and unassuming, dressed in a coat and tie for an interview, his gray hair neatly trimmed. He has a little trouble hearing and speaks softly, but his mind is clear and his recollections steady. In recent years, he confided his story with several key figures, including Lewis Merletti, a former director of the Secret Service. James Robenalt, a Cleveland lawyer and author of several books of history, has deeply researched the assassination and helped Landis process his memories. \"If what he says is true, which I tend to believe, it is likely to reopen the question of a second shooter, if not even more,\" Robenalt said. \"If the bullet we know as the magic or pristine bullet stopped in President Kennedy's back, it means that the central thesis of the Warren Report, the single-bullet theory, is wrong.\" And if Connally was hit by a separate bullet, he added, then it seemed possible it was not from Oswald, who he argued could not have reloaded that fast. Merletti, who has been friendly with Landis for a decade, was not sure what to think about his account. \"I don't know if that story's true or not, but I do know that the agents that were there that day, they were tormented for years by what happened,\" he said in an interview. Merletti referred Landis to Ken Gormley, the president of Duquesne University and a prominent presidential historian, who helped him find an agent for his book. In an interview, Gormley said he was not surprised that a traumatized agent would come forward all these years later, comparing it to a dying declaration in legal cases. \"It's very common as people get to the end of their lives,\" Gormley said. \"They want to make peace with things. They want to get on the table things they've been holding back, especially if it's a piece of history and they want the record corrected. This does not look like a play by someone trying to get attention for himself or money. I don't read it that way at all. I think he firmly believes this. Whether it fits together, I don't know. But people can eventually figure that out.\" Landis' account varies in a couple of respects from two written statements he filed in the week after the shooting. Aside from not mentioning finding the bullet, he reported hearing only two shots. \"I do not recall hearing a third shot,\" he wrote. Likewise, he did not mention going into the trauma room where Kennedy was taken, writing that he \"remained outside by the door\" when the first lady went in. Gerald Posner, author of \"Case Closed,\" a 1993 book that concluded that Oswald indeed killed Kennedy on his own, said he was dubious. While he did not question Landis' sincerity, Posner said the story did not add up. \"People's memories generally do not improve over time, and it is a flashing warning sign to me, about skepticism I have over his story, that on some very important details of the assassination, including the number of shots, his memory has gotten better instead of worse,\" he said. \"Even assuming that he is accurately describing what happened with the bullet,\" Posner added, \"it might mean nothing more than we now know that the bullet that came out of Gov. Connally did so in the limousine, not on a stretcher in Parkland where it was found.\" Landis said the reports he filed after the assassination included mistakes; he was in shock and had barely slept for five days, as he focused on helping the first lady through the ordeal, he said, and not paying enough attention to what he submitted. He did not think to mention the bullet, he said. It was not until 2014 that he realized that the official account of the bullet differed from his memory, he said, but he did not come forward then out of a feeling that he had made a mistake in putting it on the stretcher without telling anyone in that pre-\"CSI,\" secure-the-crime-scene era. \"I didn't want to talk about it,\" Landis said. \"I was afraid. I started to think, did I do something wrong? There was a fear that I might have done something wrong and I shouldn't talk about it.\" Indeed, his partner, Clint Hill, the legendary Secret Service agent who clambered onto the back of the speeding limousine i n a futile effort to save Kennedy, discouraged Landis from speaking out. \"Many ramifications,\" Hill warned in a 2014 email that Landis saved and shared last month. Hill, who has set out his own account of what happened in multiple books and interviews, cast doubt on Landis' version Friday. \"I believe it raises concerns when the story he is telling now, 60 years after the fact, is different than the statements he wrote in the days following the tragedy\" and told in subsequent years, Hill said in an email. \"In my mind, there are serious inconsistencies in his various statements/stories.\" Landis' rendezvous with history began in the small town of Worthington, Ohio, north of Columbus. After college and a stint in the Ohio Air National Guard, he was working in a clothing store when a family friend described his job in the Secret Service. Intrigued, Landis joined in 1959 in the Cincinnati office, where he chased thieves who swiped Social Security checks out of mailboxes. A year later, he was sent to Washington, where he joined the protective detail for President Dwight Eisenhower's grandchildren. After Kennedy was elected, Landis, code named Debut because of his youth, was assigned to guard the new president's children and later the first lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, alongside Hill. Because the first lady accompanied her husband to Dallas that fall day in 1963, Landis, then 28, was part of the motorcade, riding the rear of the right running board on the black Cadillac convertible, code named Halfback, just feet behind the presidential limousine. At the first shot, Landis turned to look over his right shoulder in the direction of the sound but spotted nothing. Then he turned to the limousine and saw Kennedy raising his arms, evidently hit. Suddenly, Landis noticed that Hill had leapt off their follow-up car and was sprinting toward the limousine. Landis thought about doing the same but did not have an angle. He said he heard a second shot that sounded louder and finally the fatal third shot that hit Kennedy in the head. Landis had to duck to avoid being splattered by flesh and brain matter. He knew instantly that the president was dead. Hill, now on the back of the limousine, turned back and confirmed it with a thumbs-down.Once they reached the hospital, Hill and Landis coaxed the distraught first lady to let go of her husband so he could be taken inside. After they exited the car, Landis noticed two bullet fragments in a pool of bright red blood. He fingered one of them but put it back. That's when he said he noticed the intact bullet in the seam of the tufted dark leather cushioning. He said he slipped it into his coat pocket and headed into the hospital, where he planned to give it to a supervisor but in the confusion instinctively put it on Kennedy's stretcher instead. The hospital's senior engineer later found it when he was moving Connally's stretcher, by then empty, and bumped it against another stretcher in the hall, resulting in the bullet falling out. The Warren Commission report said that it \"eliminated President Kennedy's stretcher as a source of the bullet\" because the president remained on his stretcher while doctors tried to save his life and was not removed until his body was placed in a coffin. Investigators determined that the bullet, designated Commission Exhibit 399, was fired by the same C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found in the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. They concluded that the bullet passed through Kennedy, then entered Connally's right shoulder, struck his rib, exited under his right nipple and continued through his right wrist and into his left thigh. Doctors concurred that the single bullet could have caused all the damage. But the bullet was described as nearly pristine and had lost only one or two grains of its original 160 or 161 grains in weight, causing skeptics to doubt that it could have done all that the commission said it had. Still, ballistic experts using modern forensic techniques concluded at the 50th anniversary of the assassination that the single-bullet theory was perfectly plausible. Landis said he was surprised that the Warren Commission never interviewed him but assumed that his supervisors were protecting the agents, who had been out late the night before socializing (Landis until 5 a.m., although he insisted they were not drunk). \"Nobody really asked me,\" he said. Night after night, those seconds of violence in Dallas kept replaying in his head, his own personal Zapruder film on an endless loop. \"The president's head exploding \u2014 I could not shake that vision,\" he said. \"Whatever I was doing, that's all I was thinking about.\" Many pictures of those days of mourning show Landis at Jacqueline Kennedy's side as she endured the rituals of a presidential farewell. With Landis and Hill still protecting her, the former first lady was in constant motion in the months afterward. \"She'd be in the back seat sobbing, and you'd want to say something, but it wasn't really our place to say anything,\" Landis recalled. After six months, he could not take it anymore and left the Secret Service. Haunted, he moved to Cape Cod in Massachusetts, then New York, then Ohio near Cleveland. For decades, he made a living in real estate and machine products and house painting, anything as long as it had nothing to do with protecting presidents. He was generally aware of the conspiracy theories, yet never read a book about them \u2014 or the Warren Commission report, for that matter. \"I just paid no attention to that,\" he said. \"I just removed myself. I just felt I had been there. I had seen it, and I knew what I saw and what I did. And that's all.\" He did a few interviews in 2010 and thereafter but never mentioned finding the bullet. Then, in 2014, a local police chief he knew gave him a copy of \"Six Seconds in Dallas,\" a 1967 book by Josiah Thompson arguing that there were multiple shooters. Landis read it and believed the official account of the bullet was wrong. That led to conversations with Merletti and Gormley and eventually, after many years, to his book. It was not easy. As he finished the manuscript, he stared at the computer screen, broke down and cried uncontrollably. \"I didn't realize that I had so many suppressed emotions and feelings,\" he said. \"I just couldn't stop. And that was just a huge emotional relief.\" This article originally appeared in The New York Times.", "pubDate": "2023-09-10 00:47:16", "image_url": null, "source_id": "startribune", "source_priority": 3221, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "b95da93382c0a4a45c659a91c02a5e89", "title": "Blake Masters Reconsiders His MAGA Throwdown Against Kari Lake", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/blake-masters-reconsiders-his-maga-throwdown-against-kari-lake", "keywords": ["Politics"], "creator": ["Zachary Petrizzo", " Sam Brodey"], "video_url": null, "description": "Justin Sullivan/GettyIt looked like a MAGA match-up for the ages: two of the most Trump-aligned Republicans anywhere in the country\u2014Kari Lake and Blake Masters\u2014squaring off against each other for a shot at the U.S. Senate seat held by Sen.

Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ). Lake, the Trump-obsessed failed gubernatorial candidate who continues to deny the 2020 election and her own 2022 defeat, is all but certain to launch a Senate campaign this fall. Masters, a hard-right Peter Thiel acolyte who lost his 2022 Senate bid after running a dark and dystopian campaign, is gearing up to launch his bid for the GOP nomination, according to a Wall Street Journal story last week. Running on the GOP ticket last year, the two campaigned across the state together, with one Arizona strategist saying they \u201cgenuinely like[d] each other\u201d and \u201cdrew very close\u201d on the campaign trail. But the 37-year old Masters was known to be itching for another shot at the Senate, and the Journal\u2019s report\u2014which included the detail he had already taped his campaign video\u2014suggested he\u2019d be willing to take on his old friend in order to get there. Suddenly, however, sources close to Masters are doubting whether he will go through with a campaign that would entail a brutal cage match of a primary fight against his former ally. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s running,\u201d a Republican operative who\u2019s spoken with Masters about the matter told The Daily Beast. \u201cI always thought this was a trial balloon.\u201d \u201cQuite frankly, he\u2019s never publicly acknowledged that he wants to get into the race,\u201d the operative added. \u201cThere is not one comment.\u201d Another source close to the 2022 Senate candidate agreed that Masters might be reconsidering a campaign, while a third GOP source said it would be surprising if he went through with it. Arizona Republican operative Barrett Marson told The Daily Beast he isn\u2019t convinced that Masters will run for the seat. \u201cI\u2019m not buying it yet,\u201d Mason said. On Saturday, The New York Times reported that Masters and Trump had a \u201cblunt\u201d phone call last Sunday when the former president laced into Masters over not promoting claims of election fraud. \u201cLook at Kari\u2014Kari\u2019s winning with very little money,\u201d Trump said to Masters, according to The Times. \u201cAnd if they say, \u2018How is your family?\u2019 She says, \u2018The election was rigged and stolen.\u2019 You\u2019ll lose if you go soft. You\u2019re going to lose that base.\u201d The report also claimed Masters has been questioning behind the scenes whether or not Lake will actually run for the seat. A source close to Lake fired back on that point. \"Blake Masters was outspent by $70 million dollars and completely reliant on a single Big Tech benefactor,\u201d Lake\u2019s senior adviser, Caroline Wren, told The Daily Beast, taking a swipe at Thiel. \u201cIf he believes that the party needs someone with a proven ability to fund-raise, then he's not the guy.\u201d Masters didn\u2019t return multiple Daily Beast requests for comment on this story inquiring about his plans. Adding to the confusion, some Republican insiders told The Daily Beast they do believe that Masters will ultimately run. But the consensus within Arizona GOP circles was that Masters is a lot further from jumping in than it may have seemed. Why exactly Masters might reconsider a run is unclear. Within Trump\u2019s orbit, there is a sense that it would be highly difficult for him to defeat Lake in a primary\u2014and that it would be difficult for him to win the former president\u2019s endorsement over her. Notably, Trump endorsed both Lake and Masters in their respective primaries last year, adding complexity to the dynamics if they were to both enter the race. Beyond that, it\u2019s not inevitable that Masters\u2019 biggest benefactor, Thiel, would help him in 2024 as much as he did in 2022, when he spent $17 million to support his campaign. His five-point defeat to Sen. Mark Kelly (D) was one of the GOP\u2019s biggest disappointments of last year\u2019s midterm election, and his campaign attracted national attention for its gloomy tone and the candidate\u2019s own far-right beliefs . Whatever decision Masters makes, it will significantly shape one of the marquee Senate contests of 2024, which could easily sway party control of the chamber next year. In Arizona, the GOP could benefit from an unusual general election environment, in which the centrist Sinema runs as an independent and Rep. Ruben Gallego as the Democratic nominee. (Sinema has not yet announced her plans.) A nasty and expensive primary between Lake and Masters, however, could harm the GOP\u2019s chances. But some Republicans worry that Lake is so toxic in a general election that handing her the nomination would ensure the race is over before it begins. \u201cShe\u2019s a guaranteed L,\u201d said Chuck Coughlin, a longtime GOP strategist and pollster in the state. \u201cShe can\u2019t win a general election.\u201d Despite Masters\u2019 drawbacks as a candidate, observers like Coughlin see him as someone who could at least keep the race competitive for Republicans\u2014if he rebrands himself. \u201cThis is not going to be easy, but is there a lane there that permits him to frame his candidacy around someone who can win the seat,\u201d Coughlin said. \u201cHe ran against a much better candidate than she did. He was much more competitive with Kelly than she could be with a Gallego or a Sinema.\u201d Lake\u2019s supposed allies in Trumpworld may know it too\u2014despite the chatter that the former president would back her again or even consider her as his 2024 vice presidential candidate. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see Blake beating her in a primary,\u201d a Trump adviser said. \u201cSo the hope is that Kari finally gets serious about running a real campaign with competent help, rather than the goofballs and drama queens she\u2019s had around her before.\u201d \u201cEveryone loves Blake. He\u2019s brilliant and is a true believer in the MAGA issues,\u201d this Trump adviser added. \u201cBut it\u2019s impossible to deny Kari is a charismatic talent and also got closer to winning than Blake did last time.\u201d Likewise, an operative close to the Trump campaign wondered what Trump would get out of endorsing Lake or Masters early in the primary. \u201cWhat does he gain out of endorsing in the race?\u201d this source said. But some in Trump\u2019s orbit are wary enough of Lake that they\u2019ve quietly tried to recruit her 2022 GOP primary rival, Karrin Taylor Robson , into the Senate race. Robson has publicly said she will not run, but one Trump-aligned operative recently reached out to her to urge her to reconsider, according to a source familiar with the call. The source added Robson remains committed to not running for the seat. A Trump-friendly GOP stalwart, Robson is seen as a candidate who could unite party factions and compete in a general election\u2014in part thanks to her family\u2019s immense wealth. Robson narrowly lost to Lake in the 2022 governor primary after spending $15 million of her family\u2019s fortune in the race. Neither a Lake spokesperson nor a Trump spokesperson returned The Daily Beast\u2019s requests for comment on this story. According to two sources familiar with the matter, Trump hasn\u2019t decided who he might support in a Lake-Masters showdown. Lake, of course, has not even entered the race yet, with one source aware of her plans saying she is targeting an October campaign launch date. With the race potentially evolving into a nasty MAGAworld battle, some Trumpworld operatives have sought to avoid the race altogether. As for Lake\u2019s team, they\u2019ve already begun attacking Masters. At the end of August, a Lake campaign \u201cWarRoom\u201d Twitter account ripped into Masters for joining a Twitter Spaces conversation with Arizona state House candidate Andrew Jackson. Jackson, a pastor who is known for interviewing Arizona political notables, was a supporter of Lake\u2019s but has since taken issue with her approach to alleged election irregularities. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have you back, Blake!\u201d the account wrote . \u201cWe hope your next interview is with someone who has not spent the last 9 months smearing Kari.\u201d Lake herself tagged Masters for a follow-up tweet, saying : \u201cI hope you bring up election fraud, and Election crime. You\u2019ve been quite silent. And \u2018Dr\u2019 Andrew doesn\u2019t think it exists.\u201d (For good measure, Lake added three cricket emojis to her tweet.) \u201cShe has never talked to me personally,\u201d Jackson responded when reached for comment on Lake\u2019s team taking aim at him. \u201cI\u2019m for election integrity.\u201d Jackson also took issue with Lake\u2019s blanket allegation of \u201celection crime\u201d in the 2020 election. \u201cPersonal names are being used and said they\u2019re criminals,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just saying, constitutionally, I could never call somebody a criminal unless it\u2019s proven in a court of law.\u201d Zachary Petrizzo Politics Reporter @ZTPetrizzo zachary.petrizzo@thedailybeast.com Sam Brodey Deputy Politics Editor @sambrodey Sam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com Got a tip?

There, students are giving presentations on their work to their classmates. \"We are looking for audience members that are paying close attention and forming higher-order questions,\" a teacher tells her students. The presenter, first-year Genesis Benavides, asks her fellow students: \"How do social and cultural expectations influence our own personality? Personal identity?\" Feedback from peers is part of how students work is evaluated. A student raises his hand to ask Genesis about her work. \"When you were writing your poems, did you feel like you related to it?\" he asks. \"Yes, I related to the main character, \"she answers. Students take tests and write papers at Bell, which is part of Columbia Heights Educational Campus . But presentations are another way Bell students show what they've learned. \"If a kid shows up and says something out loud, that's value. If a student talks with another student about the objective of the day, that's value,\" says Robert Athmer, special education instructor at Bell. This interaction is part of a new wave of assessment and grading policies that many U.S. schools are adopting. Recently, the Los Angeles and San Diego school districts, with nearly 700,000 students between them, removed behavior from the factors teachers use to calculate grades. And the Philadelphia and Fairfax County, Virginia, school districts are among many that have adopted no-zero policies that set 50% as the lowest score a student can get, even for a missed assignment. \"It shouldn't matter when students turn in an assignment. If they've got the knowledge, they've got the knowledge,\" said Kevin Hickerson, president-elect of the Fairfax Education Association, in 2016. Hundreds of high schools have adopted an approach called mastery. The idea is that students are given repeated opportunities to learn information until they show they've learned it. \"We put kids in classes, and we all have them learn math. And after a week or two, we move on to the next unit, and we move on, regardless of whether every student in the class has mastered the content,\" says Mike Flanagan, CEO of the Mastery Transcript Consortium. Mastery learning, he says, is aimed at requiring students \"to actually really nail the content before they move on.\" SEE MORE: Should all schools adopt a 4-day week? Traditionally, the time between tests in school, known as seat time, is fixed, and then the class learns new material. So some students learn more than others. The mastery approach aims to make all students learn the same amount, with the amount of time needed varying between students. \"The swim test isn't a swim race,\" says Flanagan. \"We're not sort of having all kids jump into the lake and see who gets across the pond first. We want to enable all kids how to teach them how to swim.\" \"Whether it's literacy, whether it's math, whether it's the fundamentals of science, you shouldn't be allowed to graduate if you've only got a C-minus or like a 70% understanding of the material,\" says Flanagan. \"If they need anything specific before going to the next step, we stay in that step until they achieve them, until they master all the standards. They can't go to the next step if they don't know 100% [of] every step.\" The move away from traditional assessments appeals to Genesis Benavides at Bell. \"I really like the way grades are handled in the school because it's not only about completing an assessment or taking a test.\" Report cards at Bell include numerical and letter grades. But dozens of U.S. high schools have adopted a new kind of transcript that describes student work, skills, and accomplishments without numerical or letter-based grades. Harvard, MIT, and Cal Tech are among the three hundred and seventeen universities that have accepted these transcripts for college applications. While each school has its own policy. The Mastery Transcript Consortium is piloting what they call a learning record, a document that skips listing courses and credits but shows progress toward mastery of skills. All fifty states now allow schools in some way to use mastery instead of grades to graduate. But alternative grading policies have drawn controversy nationwide, including in St. Lucie County, Florida, in 2018, when the district changed grading policy to make the lowest possible grade 50%. In 2017, Diane Tirado was fired during her probationary period. The district said it was because of poor performance. Tirado instead says it was her refusal to give a fifty instead of a zero for work that wasn't handed in. Well, what if they don't turn anything in? We give them a fifty. I go; no, we don't,\" she said. \"We have a nation of kids that are expecting to get paid and live their lives just for showing up, and it's not real.\" Some parents agree with the sentiment. \"You don't know what's going on at home, and it's what you see is front-level, cause if my son blatantly chooses not to do it, he knows he's got an issue,\" said one St. Lucie father. It's a debate that's only going to intensify for students, teachers, and parents as the new school year unfolds.
