Sex worker Rahab helped hide spies in her house. Lebrecht/Getty While some Christians might protest that Rahab\u2019s profession is incidental to the story, there\u2019s some academic debate about this. In one recent article Dr. Alexiana Fry asks \u201cDid the spies encounter Rahab because they were seeking sex?\u201d If James Bond has taught us anything, it\u2019s that spies have voracious sexual appetites. If that\u2019s the case then Rahab\u2019s profession is critically important. Then there\u2019s the messier and lesser-known story of Tamar in the book of Genesis. Tamar married Er, the son of Judah (the eponymous founder of the tribe of Judah) but Er died before they had any children. Judah commanded that Tamar marry Er\u2019s brother Onan in what is known as a levirate union. In this arrangement, when a man died without children, his brother would procreate with his widow and the resulting male offspring would become the deceased\u2019s legal heirs. (Yes, you did read that correctly. There\u2019s even a story in the New Testament in which Jesus is quizzed about a hypothetical situation in which a woman married seven brothers in succession). Onan, Er\u2019s younger brother, was perfectly happy to have sex with Tamar, but he didn\u2019t want to lose his additional share of Er\u2019s inheritance to a new baby. So, in the Bible\u2019s first instance of contraception, he withdrew and \u201cspilled his seed on the ground.\u201d God is unimpressed and kills Er, leaving Tamar widowed again. There is a third brother, Shelah, but he is too young to marry and so Tamar waits in her father-in-law\u2019s house for the boy to reach manhood. When he does, Judah reneges on his promise. Alone, used, and deceived, Tamar takes things into her own hands. Judah himself recently became a widower and when Tamar learned he was taking a trip she dressed herself up as a sex worker, veiled her face, and placed herself in his path. Judah did not recognize his daughter-in-law on the roadside and propositioned her. In their negotiations over the price of sex Tamar accepted the offer of a young goat but asked for Judah\u2019s seal, cord, and staff (the equivalent of his driver\u2019s license) as collateral until the goat arrived. Judah agreed and they exchanged goods. When Judah returns to swap out the goat for his personal effects the \u201cshrine prostitute\u201d had vanished. The embarrassed Judah decides to keep quiet about the whole thing. Judah and his daughter-in-law Tamar. Sepia Times/Getty Predictably, however, Tamar becomes pregnant, and her male relatives are on the cusp of burning her to death when she produces the seal, staff, and cord. Judah recognizes his property and concludes that her act of deception and prostitution was fair play: \u201cShe is more righteous than I,\u201d he says, \u201csince I wouldn\u2019t give her to my son Shelah.\u201d Tamar didn\u2019t have to sleep with her in-laws anymore and her twin sons became the heirs to Judah. In the New Testament, as is relatively well-known, Jesus regularly fraternizes with sex workers (not like that, though). In one story, that appears in various versions in the Gospels, a woman bursts into the home of Simon the leper in Bethany and anoints Jesus with a costly jar of perfumed ointment. (In 591 CE Pope Gregory the Great mistakenly identified this woman as Mary Magdalene, sparking two millennia of confusion about Mary M\u2019s profession.) The sulky disciples are quite sniffy about the whole thing and declare it a waste of money, but Jesus shuts that down. He responds that she has anointed him for burial, \u201cTruly I tell you, wherever the good news is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in remembrance of her.\u201d As Sarah Levin-Richardson has written in her book on The Brothel of Pompeii , sex workers were often gifted perfume by clients. The fact that this woman is moving around unaccompanied at night and has access to perfumed oil, thus, suggests that she was part of the world\u2019s oldest profession. A woman, who Pope Gregory the Great, mistakenly identified as Mary Magdalene anoints the feet of Jesus. Hulton Archive/Getty In Luke\u2019s version of the story, the woman\u2019s occupation is quite explicit, she is described as a \u201csinful woman.\u201d In this version, she washes his feet with her tears and dries them with her hair. Once again, Jesus rebukes her critics\u2014in this instance, a Pharisee. Though in this version Jesus does refer to the woman\u2019s many sins and forgives them, he does not ask her to change her profession or explicitly refer to sexual misconduct as being among her sins. This is in distinction to a story in the Gospel of John in which he directly tells a man he had just healed to \u201csin no more.\u201d At a minimum, Jesus isn\u2019t that hung up on her trade and was happy for her to use the fruits of her work to anoint him. Though some readers might think that these stories are outliers in a compendium of old-fashioned patriarchal morality, the women are not. Jesus\u2019s words about the woman who anoints him form one of his most secure prophecies: we are, in fact, still talking about her. As for Tamar and Rahab, in Christian tradition they are remembered as instrumental in the history of Israel and genealogy of Jesus himself. The Gospel of Matthew begins with a long list of ancestors that ties Jesus, through Joseph, to David and Abraham. It is, as you would expect, a long list of men begetting one another. But explicitly named in this catalog of men are five women: Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, the wife of Uriah (i.e. Bathsheba), and Mary, the mother of Jesus. What ties these women together? Well, while someone might argue that the four women who preceded Mary are outsiders and their inclusion signals that Jesus\u2019 message would be delivered to gentiles as well as Jews this argument doesn\u2019t quite work. How would these women be connected to Mary, a Jew? The other explanation is that all five women were involved in sexual scandals. Tamar and Rahab had practiced sex work; Ruth seduced and later married her kinsman Boaz; and, in the view of ancient readers, Bathsheba was an adulteress. What links them to Mary is the veil of suspicion that surrounded the conception of Jesus. In the Gospels she is explicitly identified as a virgin who had not had sex with anyone, but plenty of non-Christians found the tale a bit hard to believe if not outright laughable. The North African Christian writer Tertullian tells us that people accused Jesus of being the \u201cson of a carpenter or a whore.\u201d The pagan critic Celsus says that she was seeing a Roman soldier on the side. Mary might have been a virgin, but she had a bad reputation and was regularly slut shamed by Christianity\u2019s critics. Leaving Mary aside, the fact remains that for early Christians the women who broke the sexual rules were instrumental in the history of Israel and the generation of Jesus. Assertive women who used the resources they had to better their circumstances and those of their family members are implicitly valued and respected. More importantly they play a critical role in securing the success and survival of God\u2019s chosen people. The genealogy of Jesus\u00ad\u2014which omits the docile wives and virtuous homemakers in Israel\u2019s history\u2014is a tacit indictment of slut shaming writ large. As it turns out, well-behaved women rarely rate a mention in the history of Jesus. Candida Moss @candidamoss candidarmoss@gmail.com Got a tip?

So make it at home!", "content": "-- Shares Facebook Twitter Reddit Email Comfort food doesn't always have to be heavy, fattening or filling. As long as something lends some sense of familiarity and reassurance, some level of nostalgia or softness, then that food can be a comfort food \u2014 whether that's a rack of ribs , chicken parm , cheesecake or a quiche . For me, one dish that falls squarely within that paradigm is none other than Caesar salad. Related Tableside service deserves a renaissance \u2014 across all cuisines and price points Caesar salad is a nostalgia-inducing dish: I remember being a very little tyke and having my first Caesar and being astonished at the flavor. Later on, I enjoyed perhaps the best Caesar salad of my life at a castle in Kentucky (yup, you read that correctly). Then there's every single time I've enjoyed the Caesar at Houston's . And the list goes on and on. I am a little incensed, however, whenever I have a dry, unappealing side Caesar with some nondescript, overly white sludge that is no more than a poor excuse for dressing \u2014 which is all the more reason to make it at home. I've tweaked my recipe many a time, but I tend to emulate chef Anne Burrell's eggless recipe , just because I'm not too into the idea of loose, raw egg floating indiscriminately in my dressing (I guess I'm not equal opportunity, though, since I'm more than okay with it in raw cookie dough , albeit begrudgingly). It's also a great weeknight meal since it's a pretty streamlined dish to make. We need your help to stay independent Subscribe today to support Salon's progressive journalism As with most things, though, I'm very, very pointed with my Caesar proclivities, so here's a rundown of how I like to put mine together: Lettuces I'm a romaine and/or iceberg guy. Nothing in between: no frilly leaves, no microgreens , definitely no baby spinach. We need a heartier, sturdier leaf to hold up to the rich thickness of the dressing . Also, please dry your lettuces throughly and completely! It's immensely important. Croutons I like a garlicky, large, super-crisp crouton , so I often buy a baguette or Italian bread, cube it and then crisp it up in a pan or in the oven in lots of garlic-flavored oil. Also, be sure to both dry and then season them well. Some people have gotten into bread crumbs, which I actually love in salads, but I prefer the legitimate crunch of a whole crouton for a real classic, tableside , steakhouse Caesar vibe. It also helps with some textural differentiation throughout the salad. The egg discourse if you're into it, throw in an egg yolk or two! It adds to the viscosity and shine of the dressing, but I find the flavor change negligible and the sliminess of raw egg generally skeeves me out, so I leave it out. Garlic I'm normally a garlic aficionado through and through, oftentimes throwing in double or triple the amount that a recipe calls for, but that's for cooked garlic. I've gotten more and more sensitive to raw garlic lately; it's just too darn punchy, sharp and borderline acrid. I'd go with a single clove, grated on a microplane or minced super finely. You could also always use some garlic powder instead (maybe a sprinkle of its buddy onion powder , too?). Another option would be to forego the garlic in the dressing and cook the croutons with tons of garlic, so you're still getting the customary garlic flavor that way. A roasted garlic Caesar is also a superb idea. Cheese I adore a wild shower of freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano , ideally on a microplane, but pre-grated Parm is obviously totally fine. Some incorporate cheese into the dressing, which is also great, but I sometimes find that that causes the dressing to break or be a bit too solid for me? So I sometimes skip the cheese in the dressing and instead just adorn the top of the salad with an absolutely ludicrous amount of cheese. Staples You need the Worcestershire , you need the olive oil, you need the mustard, you need the vinegar. I often like to go with sherry , but a good red wine vinegar always works. Mustard-wise, I often go a little light on the Dijon because it can sometimes be a bit overpowering. You also need lots of lemon here. Buy organic or whole lemons. Roll them before juicing, use a reamer if you have it and use a fine-mesh strainer to catch seeds. Anchovies Unless you're Alison Roman, you're probably not consuming anchovies with reckless abandon on the regular. I don't buy them often and I don't have a special affinity for them, but they are a must in a \"real\" Caesar. I'd go with one or two, personally, but if you're all about that tinned fish lifestyle and are trying to add 10 \u2014 nobody's stopping you. It's your kitchen! Black pepper As I've written about before, I don't use black pepper often. I just find the sharp flavor too distracting in most foods. I always abide by the Burrell notion that salt is used in everything, while black pepper should be used as a seasoning would \u2014 only in particular dishes and for certain applications. Caesar salad, though, is one of the only times in which I use lots and lots (and lots and lots) of freshly cracked black pepper, both in the dressing and over the top before covering with a mountain of Parm. Don't skimp on it! It's essential for that iconic Caesar flavor. Protein additions Anything \u2014 or nothing \u2014works here, but you obviously cannot beat the classic grilled chicken . It's totally not necessary, though. I sometimes find that it weighs down the leaves or soaks up some of the dressing, leaving some of the salad itself undressed. Preparation I always make my dressing in a blender or VitaMix \u2014 I like the smoothness and consistency \u2014 but you can totally make it in a bowl with a large whisk. You want to make sure you're incorporating lots of air, though, so the dressing has some real heftness and body. You need to toss this salad! Do not just merely top some naked leaves with a spoonful of dressing and serve. This is the salad that the dressing needs to be properly so it's legitimately dispersed amongst the lettuces and croutons. I like using tongs for this, but if you have tossers, though, this is a perfect time to get them out. You can also take this in different directions by either grilling the romaine, which is always a fun touch, or serving it in more of a wedge-type siltation. I also sometimes like serving entire romaine \"planks\" \u2014 I love the texture and the fork-and-knife aspect \u2014 but the classic application is obviously always perfect. Up to you! Finally, be sure to use a truly enormous bowl; you'll need the space. A wooden one gives a fun, tableside appeal. Want more great food writing and recipes?

Biden warmly greeted Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto leader, , after they appeared together along with several other leaders at the Group of 20 summit Saturday in New Delhi. The leaders had gathered to announce an ambitious plan to build a rail and shipping corridor linking India with the and Europe. Biden smiled and shook hands with the crown prince, who is often referred to by his initials , as the announcement wrapped up. This year\u2019s host, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, quickly draped his own hand over their hands. The cordial greeting was a sharp contrast to the last time Biden and the met, just over a year ago, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. During that encounter, Biden awkwardly greeted the crown prince with a fist bump, a moment roundly criticized by human rights activists, who were already upset at Biden\u2019s decision to meet with the Saudi leader. Bin Salman has been harshly criticized for his human rights violations. Joe Biden can\u2019t pronounce the names of other world leaders.

At the event, we will also announce 25 top game startups as the 2024 Game Changers. Apply or nominate today ! Brian Ward, CEO of Savvy Games Group , has taken the lead in helping Saudi Arabia\u2019s attempt to move beyond its reputation for human rights abuses and being an oil nation to being a visionary technology leader bankrolling the game industry. This tension between the past and the future is ever-present in Saudi Arabia, where companies like Savvy Games Group \u2014 owned by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia \u2014 are trying to change perceptions through games while remaining cognizant of the kingdom\u2019s appetite for measured change. Ward believes people have to see the change happening in society on the ground in Saudi Arabia in order to understand how quickly things can happen under the new regime that is mostly supportive of the game industry. There is perhaps no other country where the clash between tradition and modernity \u2014 something my world history professor talked about so long ago \u2014 is so stark. The change and the deals have been happening at a dizzying rate. It\u2019s like a big game of Monopoly, and the playing board of the game industry is set up on a global scale. Savvy Games Group acquired Los Angeles-based mobile game publisher Scopely for $4.9 billion in April, and it bought a $1 billion stake in Sweden-based game publisher Embracer Group. It also acquired ESL Gaming and FaceIt in esports to create ESL FaceIt Group. And the Saudis have also bought stakes in Capcom, Nexon and Nintendo this year, building on stakes it acquired previously in Activision Blizzard, Take-Two Interactive and Electronic Arts. That has made the gaming world take notice. Savvy\u2019s big stakeholder, the Public Investment Fund (run by the Saudi Arabian government) is flush with cash from the oil boom and it has set aside $37.8 billion to build up Saudi Arabia\u2019s presence in the global games industry \u2013 with $13.3 billion of that earmarked for acquiring a major publisher. That\u2019s more money than anyone around the world is earmarking for gaming investments and acquisitions. It\u2019s a sign that the government is serious about weaning the country from oil. The Saudi Vision 2030 is a government program launched by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to diversify economically, socially and culturally, in line with the vision of bin Salman. The Saudis announced it in 2016, but the country remained about 74% dependent on oil exports as of 2021. The country understands that the oil economy could dry up in the next 27 years, and it has to have other jobs ready \u2014 and they are trickling in so far. For the games industry, this influx of Saudi money into games is not without controversy, as the Saudi funding is controversial and the company has only been at it since November 2021. Critics say that the regime of Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud doesn\u2019t respect human rights. As crown prince and prime minister, he was connected to the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 via alleged killers who had ties to the crown prince. Accepting funding from the Saudis under such a regime represents a moral quandary, as the Saudis have become a big source of funding in their efforts to diversify beyond their dependence on oil, which the world is in the process of moving away from in pursuit of clean energy. Saudi defenders say that all major sources of money in the world are tainted in some way, and accepting money from the Saudis does not mean you have to accept interference from the Saudis or embrace their agenda. Ward pointed out in an interview with GamesBeat that the country is undergoing change when it comes to women\u2019s rights and other freedoms, and it is serious about creating transformative results when it comes to diversity and new jobs associated with game studios. Still, given the fact that being gay is illegal in Saudi Arabia, The Last of Us Part 2 was banned in the country for having gay women in its leading roles. Ward has said the company aims to become a great games company and is not tied to a specific political agenda and he is not there for an \u201cimage makeover project.\u201d While change may be happening, it\u2019s not happening fast enough for critics. I caught up with Ward in an interview at the company\u2019s booth at the Gamescom expo in Cologne, Germany. Here\u2019s an edited transcript of our interview. Brian Ward: Sorry I wasn\u2019t able to meet before. GamesBeat: You guys were busy buying somebody. Brian Ward: That was a hectic time. GamesBeat: How are things going since then? Especially with acquiring Scopely. Ward: Very good. We\u2019re obviously delighted to have closed the transaction with Scopely. Their Monopoly Go product is fantastic. It\u2019s doing very well. The people are working super hard on integration. They\u2019ve been a pleasure to work with in that regard. So far we\u2019re delighted. GamesBeat: On things like esports, I wonder how much focus you have on MENA (Middle East/North Africa) versus the wider world. Ward: We\u2019re pretty globally focused. The live attendance on all the majors this year has been up. The viewership, the hours watched have been up. There have been some hiccups in the sector generally with publisher spend on esports this year, but overall the business has been doing great. We\u2019re focused on MENA, of course. The EFG folks are in the middle of executing on Gamers8. There are plans for that tournament to be bigger and more robust next year. There\u2019s a lot going on. The conference next week will be a good one. GamesBeat: Is that a first for them, or have they been doing them before? Ward: This is the second version of Next World Forum. Gamers8 started during COVID as Gamers Without Borders, for charity relief. This is the second version of both the G8 and the NWF. GamesBeat: Is there a feeling of progress as you come out of COVID? Esports had to take some huge hits during that time. It transformed a lot as well. Ward: I think we\u2019re beyond COVID. The capital markets, the economic situation last year and coming into this year, caused some publishers to pull back on their esports spend, which affected a couple of pieces of the business, but overall attendance is up. Viewership is up. There seems to be as much engagement as there was before from a fan point of view. GamesBeat: For Saudi gamers and Saudi esports fans, how would you describe the market? Ward: When we invested in EFG, it seemed that coming out of COVID \u2013 that was nearly two years ago now \u2013 it was an inflection point where engagement had changed or accelerated because of COVID, and there would be some consolidation in esports. There would be some dynamics that would sort themselves out, whether it\u2019s the relationship between players and teams and publishers and where the power base really sits. A lot of that still has to get sorted out. Team economics are not universally great. GamesBeat: The game industry itself, where do you see the trends developing? Ward: We\u2019re super excited, especially on the heels of closing Scopely. We\u2019re excited about mobile-first cross-platform opportunities. Scopely is also making great progress in direct payments. That\u2019s an interesting economic lever for us. For Savvy, we now have a great anchor in mobile. We\u2019re looking forward to figuring out how we can facilitate, like we\u2019re doing with Scopely, some partners in PC and console. GamesBeat: You\u2019re still looking around for opportunities? Ward: This year we haven\u2019t been looking at as many opportunities. We\u2019ve been focused internally on making sure we have the right leadership team in place. Scopely is a big acquisition. The integration is fairly involved. We\u2019re focused on making sure that we\u2019re putting some investment professionals in place, so we don\u2019t rely on external advisors as much. We\u2019re focused internally on our structure and governance and operating model, more so than looking for additional investments. GamesBeat: Were there some things that made you think that the period in which you were buying assets there \u2013 was that fortuitous in some ways? When there are downturns in the economy, prices for acquisitions are lower. It\u2019s a good time to buy. Did that matter to you? If you have strategic imperatives to move into a business fast, you probably don\u2019t care as much about the economic situation. Ward: That\u2019s true. It\u2019s very difficult to time the market. It\u2019s been fortuitous that valuations have come off a bit and those people with capital to employ have been in a market where it\u2019s been more difficult for people to find as many varied sources of capital as there were two years ago. That\u2019s advantageous to us. But we haven\u2019t pulled on that lever very hard. This year we\u2019ve been focused more internally. GamesBeat: For games it seems like there was a lot of pressure on valuations, after some very big excitement in 2021. Everybody thought that usage was going to go up forever. Is there a level-setting that you see that still reflects favorable trends? Ward: Overall, I think the trends are super favorable for the long term. We don\u2019t get too excited about this year versus last year or 2022 versus COVID. Long term we think this is probably the best entertainment business to be in. Yes, there\u2019s some sort of reconciliation. Figuring out where usage and engagement will land after COVID. But that will settle. GamesBeat: I listened to Take-Two\u2019s earnings call. It was interesting to hear Strauss Zelnick answer a question about games and Hollywood, all the synergy happening right now. Someone asked why they aren\u2019t doing more of that. He said, \u201cWe came from movies. It was a very hard business. There were many failures.\u201d For years everyone saw that the big opportunity was in games, so why would they go back in a big way? Although he did say that they\u2019re working on a Borderlands movie and some other projects. They\u2019re participating in that. But he felt like it was a no-brainer that gaming is still the more interesting business. Ward: It\u2019s kind of the flip side of the trend from 20 years ago, where movies became games. Now it\u2019s games becoming movies. GamesBeat: Do you think about that as an opportunity as well? Ward: Not yet. We\u2019re not focused on that at the moment. I still view us as a startup. We have maybe a couple hundred people in Saudi Arabia and 4,000 worldwide. We still have a lot of things to do in terms of building a games business. We have a pretty good esports business. GamesBeat: Are you focused on building a larger local staff? Ward: Very much so. The studio, which is now renamed Steer Studios, has done a super job. They now have about 80 people on two or three mobile teams, and 80% of them are Saudis. We\u2019re highly focused and highly incentivized against building out the local ecosystem. GamesBeat: How does that mix in with the Scopely business? Is it alongside Scopely? Ward: Scopely is very interested in the MENA region and expanding beyond their traditional markets. We expect that they\u2019ll be looking at opportunities in MENA and Saudi specifically. GamesBeat: How do you look back after some years on the issues around human rights that people have had with Saudi Arabia, whether or not they want to do business there? How is that turning out? Ward: My standard answer to this, or part of my standard answer, is for folks to take the time to understand what\u2019s going on there and how far this social transformation and economic diversification project is coming in the last five years. A tremendous amount of progress has been made toward Vision 2030 and all of this transformation. It\u2019s exciting. We\u2019re super happy to be part of it, part of this long-term journey. GamesBeat: Is there some sense of mission attached to that connected to Savvy? Ward: This is what really attracted me to this position and got me to move to Riyadh. I understood a bit about Vision 2030 and the economic diversification, social transformation aspect. But once I saw, once I visited for the first time and saw what that meant on the ground, I could see that this is kind of like China 35 years ago. The pace of change is astonishing. It seemed to be a unique opportunity to take part in something worthwhile. That\u2019s why I went there, and I think a lot of the people we\u2019ve hired and who have moved there are inspired by the same opportunity. GamesBeat: The flow of money into games, do you have any general observations about that? Is there some history to that flow? I just remember that when I joined VentureBeat 15 years ago, I thought I would stop covering games. There was a focus on venture capital for (tech), and there was (virtually) no venture capital for games. I thought I\u2019d end up covering tech more than games. But here we are 15 years later and GamesBeat is very big. Ward: You would know far more about this, but the level of engagement and the fan base and reach now of games, for those of us who\u2019ve been doing this almost 30 years \u2013 I remember thinking, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if we were eventually bigger than the music industry?\u201d Now we\u2019re bigger than those guys and the movies and somebody else put together. When you think about 3.2 billion people on the planet playing games on a regular basis, it\u2019s astonishing. GamesBeat: Saudi Arabia is also into building new cities and new structures. Do you have some sort of dream for that? How would building cities with games in mind happen? Ward: As you know, Vision 2030 encompasses all of those things. The giga-projects at NEOM and Qiddiya, which have significant \u2013 I mean, Qiddiya is essentially an entertainment-based city being built just west of Riyadh. We have a big part to play in the game section of that city. NEOM has a big games component to it as well. All these things are tied together under not only Vision 2030, but the national strategy for games and esports. Saudi, to my knowledge, is the only country on the planet that\u2019s announced a national strategy backed by the government for our sector. All of these things are interconnected in some pretty major ways. GamesBeat: The one hiccup that we\u2019ve seen lately is whether or not you were going to do the investment in Embracer. I don\u2019t know how you would signal to the rest of the market what that means. That particular deal is one that maybe wasn\u2019t going to happen. Is there any change in strategy? Ward: We don\u2019t have a change in our strategy. Our strategy has been consistent for the last two years. When we made our initial significant investment in Embracer, we had great faith in the leadership and the long-term strategic vision for Embracer. That hasn\u2019t changed either. We\u2019re very happy with our investment in Embracer over the long term. GamesBeat: The interest in doing large deals, is that still part of what you want? Ward: I think Scopely is the sixth-largest M&A deal in our industry\u2019s history. We\u2019re still interested, and we\u2019ve deployed maybe 25% of the capital designed to be allocated to us over the long term. We still have a significant part of our mandate to fulfill. GamesBeat: Do you have an interest in making sure you\u2019re not perceived as investing at valuations that are too high, or throwing too much money at your targets? Ward: We employ a lot of excellent and well-paid advisors to give us good opinions on these things. We trust the advice they give us. We think we\u2019ve done deals that have been very beneficial to Saudi and fair to both parties. If we looked at the transaction value on Scopely today we\u2019d be very pleased with how that\u2019s working out, given our mission. It\u2019s long term. People probably thought Amazon paying a billion dollars for Twitch was crazy at the time. GamesBeat: The good old days, when prices were low. For women in Saudi Arabia, do you feel like there are real opportunities for change for them? Ward: This is the thing that surprised me. I didn\u2019t have any personal knowledge or experience of the region. To see firsthand what was going on there in relation to opportunities for women, just generally speaking, was a real eye-opener. In a studio, which has nearly 80 people so far \u2013 this is a development studio. Almost 30% of that workforce are women. At any studio anywhere in the world that would be a pretty remarkable number. There\u2019s an equally high percentage of women in the Saudi workforce generally. It\u2019s exciting. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019m really happy about. When the Scopely guys came to visit, around the time of the closing, or just prior to the closing, we had a lunch for Scopely leadership and all of the local women employees in Saudi. The Scopely folks said they were blown away by the level of energy, enthusiasm, knowledge, and professionalism in that group. One of them said he wished he could bottle up that energy and take it back to California. GamesBeat: U.S. money has been going all over the world for decades. I suppose you could put an interpretation on that money. When China was also in the position of being able to finance a lot of the world, I think people wondered if they have a philosophy that also gets exported along with those investments in all those companies. Do they run these companies in a Chinese way? What is your own view as far as the next entity that really has the opportunity to invest all over the world? Is there a philosophy you\u2019d like to export, but also maybe one that stays at home in Saudi Arabia as well? Ward: There isn\u2019t a philosophy, other than we\u2019ve always intended to be and have been consistent in communicating this \u2013 we\u2019ve been given carte blanche to operate like a true games company, consistent with the values of our industry, what people consider to be important. That\u2019s been true. That was one thing I was pretty alive to when I first thought about the opportunity, because to your point, Chinese companies tend to operate \u2013 not all of them, but they tend to operate in a Chinese way. Western companies operate in a western way. But I can\u2019t say there\u2019s any defining set of values around being a Saudi games company. We\u2019re just trying to be a games company, period. GamesBeat: One interesting data point, maybe, that I was thinking about now. I wrote a profile on this guy named Amir Satvat who works for Amazon. He\u2019s kind of a quant. During the big layoffs that started happening in the fall, he started scraping all the game industry sites for job openings. He aggregated them into a spreadsheet on LinkedIn and made it available for everyone to look at. Here\u2019s all the jobs. He came up with 732 companies and 14,000 jobs that are open. The fun part was that he\u2019s noticed that for the last six weeks or so, that number has been steady. He sees that as a stabilization happening over a relatively short amount of time. Before that openings were tending to go down. Does that mean anything to you, that the collective number of jobs in the game industry is starting to go back up? Ward: I\u2019m not an expert by any stretch. I would anticipate that most of the post-COVID reconciliation of how many users there are, the engagement level and so forth has sorted itself out in terms of how many people we need to meet demand. We should start to be back to business as usual. That\u2019s what I would expect. GamesBeat: There\u2019s AI as well. Nobody knows what that\u2019s going to mean. I talked to a professor a few weeks ago who was saying that we could have a 10% boost to world GDP by 2032 with all the AI advances happening now. That\u2019s $11 trillion. That\u2019s happening. He thinks there\u2019s going to be more change in the next 10 years from AI than in the last 150 years of industrial revolution. One of his guys looked at a typical 2,000-person enterprise and found that jobs in that enterprise would probably be done with one-third to two-thirds fewer people. All these things seem to suggest we\u2019re about to be in another time of change. We thought there was change already in the last few decades, but there\u2019s more coming. Ward: But isn\u2019t that one of the best things about our industry, the constant change and development and evolution of it? I think AI is going to add a lot of jobs. There will be shifting in who does what. Did we need less artists when SpeedTree was introduced? No, we needed more. More tools mean more stuff gets done. That\u2019s the way I view it.

It has all the comforting flavors of a pie minus the skill required to roll out a perfectly flaky dough, and, more importantly, plus the delightful crunch of baked oats. Best of all, a crisp gives new purpose to fruit that might be approaching its last leg; the kind that's still edible but is too mushy to eat on its own. In its , a crisp is composed of fruit coated in sugar and flour and topped with oats tossed with melted butter (and then more sugar and flour). With such a simple foundation, there's plenty of room to experiment with unlikely ingredients. The next time you make a crisp at home, add a little tang with a dollop of mayonnaise in the oat topping. Though it might seem like a hard sell, trust us: It'll balance out the sweetness of the berries and add some depth of flavor to the dish. Hellmann's, which is among the top four at the time of this writing, will be the first to tell you that fruit crisps and mayo go hand in hand. The brand features a blueberry crisp recipe with mayonnaise on its , which calls for half a cup of the condiment in the oat topping. (Aside from Hellmann's, also calls for mayo in its recipe for apple cobbler, proving that the ingredient pairs well with all kinds of fruity desserts.) Even people who love sweets know that overripe blueberries need a little acid to take the edge off their sweetness, which is why so many call for lemon juice. In a crisp, mayonnaise adds just the right amount of zing, thanks to distilled white vinegar and/or lemon juice. While store-bought mayo is totally acceptable, whipping up a might lead to an even tastier crisp. All you need is an egg, olive oil, lemon juice or vinegar, and salt. Adding mayonnaise to sweets is an older practice than you might think. Some historians trace the origin of to the Great Depression, when eggs and other dairy products were hard to come by. Mayonnaise, which was inexpensive and easy to find, added moisture and body to baked goods. The first known published recipe for mayonnaise cake, which appeared in a 1927 issue of the , gave rise to the dessert's second wave of popularity during World War II, when baking essentials like sugar, milk, eggs, and butter were rationed. Today's unpredictable egg prices \u2014 which, after months of inflation, are \u2014 might not be dire enough to inspire a mass resurgence of mayonnaise-based baking. Still, it's good to know that the condiment is always there in tough times.

This week, the United Nations issued its first report card for this goal and found that the world is falling behind while time is running out. Under the , countries agreed to pitch in what they could to slash greenhouse gas emissions. Their initial proposals were nowhere near enough, so the accord created a mechanism called the global stocktake to keep everyone accountable. Unlike other UN climate change reports that are meant to be informative and shy away from policy recommendations, the is explicitly meant to spur countries to act. It\u2019s a blunt progress assessment, and it lays out how much further countries must go in their emissions commitments the next time they come to the negotiating table at , which will be held in the United Arab Emirates this December. \u201cThe Paris Agreement has driven near-universal climate action,\u201d the report notes, but \u201cmuch more is needed now on all fronts.\u201d The task ahead is immense: According to the report, global emissions need to be slashed 43 percent by 2030 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, one of the main goalposts of the Paris agreement. But the world has already warmed about 1.2 degrees so far above preindustrial averages and is on track to pass the key threshold in the next few years. So when negotiators reconvene at the next climate summit, the stocktake will shape the discussion. \u201cIt carries a lot of weight,\u201d said European Climate Foundation CEO Laurence Tubiana, who helped negotiate the Paris agreement. \u201cThe [stocktake] is looking backwards, but even more importantly setting the direction for the next phase of climate policymaking.\u201d Among its recommendations, the report unapologetically calls for \u201cphasing out all unabated fossil fuels\u201d and for a \u201cradical decarbonization of all sectors of the economy.\u201d But in a world facing economic turmoil, energy shocks, and unrelenting opposition from the biggest polluters, there are open questions about whether leaders will heed the message at all, and what they\u2019ll actually do about it. Coal, oil, and natural gas need to go The stocktake says in stark terms that there can be no new fossil fuel infrastructure in a world committed to keeping warming in check, including phasing out the existing coal industry before 2050. The exact language here is important. At , countries fought over every word around fossil fuels, whether they should call for a \u201cphase out\u201d or a more watered-down phrase like \u201cenergy transition.\u201d The latter leaves room for new fossil fuels without looking like governments are going back on their word. But the stocktake, which will inform the political process from here on out, echoes the findings of other global bodies that no new fossil fuel infrastructure should be built in a world aligned with 1.5 degrees. There\u2019s some vagueness in what \u201cunabated\u201d means, however, and it\u2019s likely to be a contentious topic at the next COP. The language leaves room, Tubiana explained, for remaining fossil fuels to rely on technology like carbon capture and storage. \u201cBy 2050 we\u2019ll still have fossil fuels in the pipeline, the question is how much,\u201d Tubiana said. One key barrier to transitioning from fossil fuels is the trillions of dollars in subsidies that governments pour into the industry year after year. A recent analysis from the International Monetary Fund found these subsidies have only grown; they surged to , $2 trillion more than in 2021. \u201cThe removal of fossil fuel subsidies is a key strategy for addressing structural economic barriers that can perpetuate inertia to change and prevent cost-effective low-carbon alternatives from being adopted at scale,\u201d the report says. The stocktake also emphasizes the need to address emissions across the economy. Governments can\u2019t overlook the role of sectors like industry, which contributes to 25 percent of global emissions, and , which contributes 15 percent. Reducing these emissions requires targeting the demand and the supply in these sectors. For example, in transportation, regulations and incentives will help to phase out the internal combustion engine and push manufacturers to offer at a vast scale, but governments also need to think about reducing the need for private vehicles altogether through tactics like public transit. This extends to sectors like international and , both areas that are hard to decarbonize and have often been ignored in international climate negotiations. The stocktake is clear that the time for small, incremental change is over: We need to think in terms of systems-wide change, and a wide breadth of to make deeper emissions cuts. \u201cIf you\u2019re rowing and you can turn your oar faster and faster, but if it\u2019s not really going deep enough, you won\u2019t get anywhere,\u201d said , director of the World Resources Institute\u2019s International Climate Initiative. \u201cWe need to think in pace and speed, of course, but we also need depth.\u201d Everyone is doing something, but everyone needs to do more The test now is whether countries will make the \u201crapid and deep\u201d greenhouse gas cuts the report says are required, delivering more financing and even deeper emissions cuts in the next round of pledges in 2025. But countries are dealing with other challenges too, and that will also shape what they bring to the table at COP28. Shocks to food and , along with inflation, may mean there is less money to invest in clean energy. Major fossil fuel companies are also trying to influence the discussions and maintain their market share. Meanwhile, many nations are still struggling to meet their own self-imposed pledges. The US, for example, has set a goal of slashing carbon pollution 50 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 while contributing $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund. But it\u2019s struggling to meet both goals, even after the passage of last year. Some countries have even seen their So mustering the political will to make these drastic changes is going to be an immense challenge. But at the same time, cleaner energy is more affordable than ever and the stocktake says a transition away from fossil fuels is within our grasp. In many parts of the world, wind and are the cheapest sources of new energy, sometimes undercutting existing fossil fuel sources. \u201cThere are now sufficient cost-effective opportunities to address the 2030 emissions gap,\u201d the report says.

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Job seekers in 2008-09 recession. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) Getty Images The next recession will not be a disaster. I expect a recession to begin early in 2024, or possibly late this year, and that frightens many people. But recessions do not hurt most people, though they certainly can be very harmful to some. Employment in Recessions Unemployment rises during recessions, but not as much as we seem to fear. In the recessions between 1948 and 2019, the unemployment rate during the downturns was 1.4 percentage point higher than in the 12 months preceding the recession. The average time spent unemployed increased by less than one week during recessions. Working hours are cut in recessions, but by only 24 minutes a week on average. (The Data Note at the end of this article explains the methodology behind the numbers in this article.) Definition of Recession In assessing the data, we must remember that economists define a recession as the period when economic activity is declining. Once the decline is over and the economy turns up a little, we say the recession is over even though we have not yet recovered all of the lost ground. For some variables, the data often look their worst just after the recession has technically ended. Home Prices in Recession The median and average selling prices of homes usually rise in recession. That\u2019s surprising given what happened in 2008-09, when prices fell six percent by our comparison of the recession average to the 12 prior months. From the peak for prices (which occurred a year before the recession began), to the trough (two years after the recession ended), the decline was a whopping 19%. Recessions are not good for home prices. But prices usually rise over the long haul. Recessions typically slow the rise without turning prices downward. Of the ten recessions for which we have data (not counting 2020), only one shows a clear decline in prices. Eight recessions had home price increases, with the 1990 recession ambiguous.

Keep in mind that delinquent means at least 30 days late. Most delinquencies do not result in foreclosure. Banks write off more consumer loans in recession, but by less than one percentage point. Commercial real estate is even safer, with charge-offs increasing by only 0.6 percentage points. Business non-real estate lending charge-offs rise by a similar amount. Most Recession Effects Temporary In the typical economic model, the effects of a recession are temporary because the economy bounces back with above-normal growth rates, regaining its trend line. There have been some studies finding long-lasting impacts on those people who tried to find their first jobs during a recession and on people who were laid off in a recession. These studies are suggestive rather than definitive given data limitations. The most cited study found the impacts lasted seven to ten years but were not permanent. 2008-09 Recession Was Unusually Bad Today\u2019s fear of recession probably derives from the 2008-09 experience, which was especially harsh. In terms of overall impact on gross domestic product, that recession was twice as bad as the average recession preceding it. GDP declines in recessions. Dr. Bill Conerly based on data from U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis The chart shows substantial variation from one recession to another. For other variables, such as the average duration of unemployment, the range is comparably large. The largest recession increase was 2.2 weeks; the smallest 0.2 weeks. That illustrates that each recession is unique. The underly economy evolves over time, making the likely effects of a recession in the 2020s different from the 1950s. In addition, each recession occurs with unique external influences, such as world oil prices. Policy responses to recession also vary from case to case. As a result, we should not expect any particular downturn to mirror a past recession. But the past does give us an idea of the likely range of possibilities. Data Note: Recessions are defined by the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private non-profit organization. I do not include the 2020 recession in these calculations because it was atypical, being just two months in duration but very severe in magnitude. Some of the data series are not available back to 1948, so their averages were calculated over shorter time periods. Comparison of recessions with the 12 months preceding the recession is done because of drift over time in unemployment and other variables. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn . Check out my website .
