Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle noted that after Staggs blasted Romney in a July interview for not spending much time in Utah, Romney has recently begun events in his home state. LISTEN : \u201cWe, the power of Breitbart, and your program here and just calling him out because that has been a great concern,\u201d Staggs told Boyle. \u201cThe voting record is one thing, and so many Utahns are just completely opposede Jhe to his policies and the support of that Biden agenda.\u201d Staggs said it is \u201cquite ironic\u201d that Romney \u201csuddenly\u201d showed up in Utah. Boyle then mentioned that Utah Sen. Mike Lee (R) called for new Republican leadership in the Senate and asked Staggs if he supports Lee\u2019s position. \u201cI agree. 100 percent,\u201d Staggs said about wanting new Republican leadership in the Senate. \u201cI support Mike Lee in this and you\u2019re right. He\u2019s just been fantastic. He\u2019s exhibited leadership. It\u2019s what we need. I mean, we need adults in Washington, DC, that that are more interested in advancing the interests of the American public\u2014 those whom they\u2019re supposed to represent\u2014than going out there and trying to perpetuate the status quo \u2013 the establishment that unfortunately, they have demonstrated they represent,\u201d Staggs said.

We can\u2019t just let the government shut down.\u2019 And, and you just lose all your negotiating leverage day one,\u201d Staggs said. \u201cWe need some true leaders. Mike Lee, Senator Lee has demonstrated that on this issue.\u201d Staggs said Romney \u201cjust hasn\u2019t demonstrated leadership where it needs to be in pushing back against the establishment changing the status quo so it actually improves the lot of everyday Americans.\u201d \u201cSo I don\u2019t expect that we\u2019ll see anything other than him continuing to collude with, yes, sadly, the McConnell-Schumer, Cabal,\u201d Staggs said of Romney.

Then, the former president entered a motorcade to head to a private stadium suite where he watched the school's annual football grudge match Saturday with the University of Iowa. The pregame campus stop was a reminder of Trump's dominant position atop a crowded Republican field both in Iowa and nationally. Several of his rivals also attended the game, mingling with fans at pregame tailgates outside the stadium. But Trump got by far the most attention and hasn't paid a price yet for skipping the closer interactions with voters that are a cherished Iowa political tradition. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has struggled to position himself as a potent foe to Trump, came to Ames to attend the game with Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has not endorsed a candidate but often has appeared with DeSantis and his wife, Casey. As he moved from one tailgate to another, DeSantis was flanked by fans cheering and waving campaign signs from a booth hosted by the pro-DeSantis Never Back Down super PAC. \u201cWe\u2019re having a good time,\u201d DeSantis told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s quite an atmosphere, probably a little bit more civilized than the Florida-Georgia game.\u201d Trump has made a habit of visiting Iowa on the same day as DeSantis, whom Trump treats as his main threat. Their dynamic Saturday was similar to last month when Trump drew huge crowds to the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines while DeSantis addressed smaller audiences and hit the midway rides with his family. At the Alpha Gamma Rho house, students tried to photograph Trump as he worked the crowd outside the red-brick fraternity house and flipped hamburgers at the grill. There were some insults during the day. Some fans walking the streets made profane gestures at his motorcade as it moved through Ames. Prop planes flew over the stadium carrying a banner that read, \u201cWhere's Melania?\u201d The former first lady has been largely absent from the campaign so far. And hired performers wearing inflatable costumes, one posing as Trump and the other infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, held hands as they roamed the parking lot in face masks. Also appearing before the game were candidates Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor, and Asa Hutchinson, a former Arkansas governor, who greeted each other at a tailgate honoring veterans, where Sen. Joni Ernst camped out for most of the afternoon. While fans showed up Saturday for football, not politics, voters have had the chance to see most candidates who regularly appear at Iowa cattle calls and meet-and-greets. DeSantis is increasingly focused on winning or placing high in Iowa and says he's visited more than half of the state's 99 counties already. Trump, meanwhile, had made only six visits to Iowa this year before Saturday. Still, his campaign has been working in his absence, promising a more disciplined, data-driven effort for the organizational-heavy caucuses than his first campaign in 2016, when he finished second to Ted Cruz. Trump\u2019s campaign set up several booths around the parking lots, with his volunteers working to get fans to sign caucus pledge cards. He sat at the game with Iowa casino powerhouse Gary Kirke, an influential Republican donor. Trump waved at fans from the window of a skybox, though he entertained visitors who were allowed in and out before he left the game during the third quarter. Last week, Trump held a conference call with tens of thousands of Iowans. And he has done some face-to-face stops in Iowa with voters. In June, he handed out Dairy Queen \u201cBlizzards\" while also confessing aloud that he did not know what the soft-serve treats were. There is no comparable example in Iowa political history to a former president running to reclaim his old office while also under indictment for more than 90 felony counts. But other high-profile candidates and strong front-runners have done the town halls and retail campaigning for which Iowa and other early primary states are well-known. In 2007, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton entered the race for the 2008 Democratic nomination as a national celebrity and the party's heavy favorite in national polling. Drawing larger crowds, Clinton sought to meet the demand by holding smaller meetings with local activists before speaking to packed gyms and halls. Clinton also attended party events with her lesser-known rivals to demonstrate her willingness to undergo the rigor that Iowans typically demand. Ultimately, she lost the 2008 caucus to then-Sen. , who eventually won the nomination and the White House. Trump has foregone all but one such event in Iowa this year. The exception was the Iowa Republican Party Lincoln Dinner in July, a marquee event that helps to finance the caucus.", "pubDate": "2023-09-10 03:02:20", "image_url": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/wirestory_f398a634ce11048c5e49b207263994c2_16x9_1600.jpg", "source_id": "abcnews", "source_priority": 313, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "6fdb1dfc1f791bc12ad8e20de31717d5", "title": "IRS announces new plan to hire more agents for high-dollar cases to keep \u2018wealthiest filers accountable\u2019", "link": "https://nypost.com/2023/09/09/irs-sets-its-sights-on-millionaire-tax-cheaters-with-help-of-ai/", "keywords": null, "creator": ["Katherine Donlevy"], "video_url": null, "description": "The federal agency said it plans to aggressively hunt down 1,600 millionaires and 75 large business partnerships that routinely \"cut corners\" on their taxes.", "content": "The IRS announced it will start targeting thousands of uber-wealthy tax cheats and make them poney up hundreds of millions of dollars in the coming months. The federal agency said it plans to aggressively hunt down 1,600 millionaires and 75 large business partnerships that routinely \u201ccut corners\u201d on their taxes. \u201cIf you pay your taxes on time it should be particularly frustrating when you see that wealthy filers are not,\u201d IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel said. Each of the millionaire tax dodgers that the IRS set its sights on owes a minimum of at least $250,000 each in back taxes, while the partnerships have assets of roughly $10 billion on average. The IRS is planning to hire an undisclosed number of revenue agents to focus on the high-end collection cases so that the new initiative can start rolling in October this year. The crackdown represents the next phase of an offensive pursuit that the Biden Administration launched earlier this summer \u2014 in July, the IRS said it collected $38 million in delinquent taxes from more than 175 high-income taxpayers in the span of a few months. According to Werfel, the initiative is being propelled by a massive boost in federal funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to generate tax revenue for the nation. The agency is also being added by artificial intelligence tools that can detect tax-cheating tactics that might be indiscernible to the human eye. \u201cNew tools are helping us see patterns and trends that we could not see before, and as a result, we have higher confidence on where to look and find where large partnerships are shielding income,\u201d Werfel said. A team of academic economists and IRS researchers in 2021 found that the top 1% of U.S. income earners fail to report more than 20% of their earnings to the IRS. With additional support and funding, the IRS will continue to hunt larger and wealthier tax dodgers in the coming years. As part of the initiative, the agency promised that citizens earning less than $400,000 a year will not see an increase in their audit rates. \u201cThis new compliance push makes good on the promise of the Inflation Reduction Act to ensure the IRS holds our wealthiest filers accountable to pay the full amount of what they owe,\u201d said Werfel. \u201cThe years of underfunding that predated the Inflation Reduction Act led to the lowest audit rate of wealthy filers in our history.\u201d With Post Wires", "pubDate": "2023-09-10 02:15:26", "image_url": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/NYPICHPDPICT000032963483.jpg?quality=90&strip=all", "source_id": "nypost", "source_priority": 109, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "476a745e0a40e2defa07c10d4be9536e", "title": "Kamala Harris mocked for \u2018granny moves\u2019 at White House hip-hop party: \u2018Pure cringe\u2019", "link": "https://nypost.com/2023/09/09/kamala-harris-shows-of-granny-moves-at-white-house-hip-hop-party/", "keywords": null, "creator": ["Katherine Donlevy"], "video_url": null, "description": "\"Pure cringe,\" one X user wrote, as another simply said \"yuck.\"", "content": "At least she\u2019s having fun.

Trump's grip on the party's voters is as powerful as ever, with polls in Iowa and New Hampshire last month putting him at least 25 percentage points above his nearest rivals. That has left major Republican donors \u2014 whose desires have increasingly diverged from those of conservative voters \u2014 grappling with the reality that the tens of millions of dollars they have spent to try to stop the former president, fearing he poses a mortal threat to their party and the country, may be a sunk cost. Interviews with more than a dozen Republican donors and their allies revealed hand-wringing, magical thinking, calls to arms and, for some, fatalism. Several of them did not want to be identified by name out of a fear of political repercussions or a desire to stay in the good graces of any eventual Republican nominee, including Trump. \"If things don't change quickly, people are going to despair,\" Levine said in an interview. He is among the optimists who believe Trump's support is not as robust as the polls suggest and who see a quickly closing window to rally behind another candidate. In Levine's 2,500-word Labor Day missive, he urged his readers to pick Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina. Other schools of thought exist. Some donors have backed Trump's rivals despite believing that he is unbeatable in the primaries. These donors are banking, in part, on the chance that Trump will eventually drop out of the race because of his legal troubles, a health scare or some other personal or political calculation. Fred Zeidman, a Texas businessperson who is an enthusiastic backer of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, said he had given her a blunt assessment of her prospects last month. \"You're at 2%, and he's at 53%,\" he recalled telling her, in only a slight exaggeration of Trump's polling advantage. \"He ain't going to erode that much. Something needs to happen to him for you to overtake him.\" Privately, many donors said that the primary contest so far \u2014 especially the first Republican debate last month, in which Trump did not take part \u2014 had felt like a dress rehearsal for a play that would never happen. One donor's political adviser called it \"the kids' table.\" One Texas-based Republican fundraiser, who has not committed to a candidate and insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations, said he regularly told major donors that, like it or not, Trump would be the nominee. \"Intellectually, their heads explode,\" the fundraiser said. He said many donors were \"backing off\" rather than supporting a candidate, reflecting a fundamental belief that nobody can defeat Trump. Large-dollar Republican donors, even those who enthusiastically or reluctantly backed Trump in 2016 and 2020, have made no secret of their wish to move on in 2024. Some big donors have stuck with Trump, though not nearly as many as in past cycles, at least not so far; a super political action committee backing Trump has reported just 25 contributions of $100,000 or more. They include $2 million from casino magnate Phil Ruffin and $1 million from former real estate developer Charles Kushner, father of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. Trump pardoned the elder Kushner on his way out of office. Major donors, particularly those in the tier just below the billionaire power players, have seen their influence wane in recent elections, a trend inextricably bound up in Trump's continued hold on Republican voters. The explosive growth of small-dollar contributions \u2014 a phenomenon that, on the Republican side, has overwhelmingly favored Trump \u2014 reflects a widening disconnect between voters' sympathies and the interests of big donors. Conservative commentator Bill Kristol, who has become a pariah in his party over his long-standing opposition to Trump, said he told donors and their advisers at the beginning of the year that if they were serious about defeating Trump, they had to spend money in a concerted effort to convince Republican voters that he should not be the nominee. The hope was that by Labor Day, Trump's poll numbers would be in the 30s, Kristol explained. Instead, he said, \"they've done nothing, and Trump is at 50%.\" Kristol said he was not sure if donors had a kind of \"learned helplessness\" or if they were just wary of offending Trump and his supporters. \"I think, ultimately, they tell themselves they could live with him,\" he said. \"We know what a world would look like if real conservative elites really decided they wanted to get rid of Donald Trump,\" Kristol said. \"And that's not the world we are living in.\" If there was any hope among big donors that the various investigations into Trump would undermine his popular support, such dreams have faded. Each successive indictment \u2014 four since late March \u2014 has brought waves of financial contributions and new energy to his poll numbers. Some donors expressed incredulity that Trump would be able to run for president while fighting off the charges. He faces a busy calendar of trials next year that is likely to grow only more complex. \"I don't see how he's going to deal with these huge legal problems,\" said Long Island-based metals magnate Andy Sabin, who is backing Scott. \"I don't really care about his numbers. I think he's got enough other stuff going on. All of these trials start \u2014 who knows? We are in uncharted territory.\" Sabin conceded that Trump had a \"very solid base,\" adding that he would \"almost have to murder somebody\" for people to turn on him. \"People think he's God.\" Many major donors, even those who believe Trump committed crimes and who think his actions surrounding Jan. 6, 2021, were abhorrent, said they believed the indictments were politically motivated. Some also suggested that the indictments had temporarily inflated his poll numbers by keeping him in the news and fueling voter outrage on his behalf. \"I fundamentally believe Trump's numbers are artificial,\" said Jay Zeidman, a Texas-based health care investor and major fundraiser for Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida (and the son of Fred Zeidman). \"I'm not saying they are making them up; I don't think there's real strength behind those numbers.\" He continued, \"I think you have to be patient and let the gravity of the situation he's in take hold. This election is not about vindicating one man. This is not a referendum on Trump.\" Zeidman, like others, said he believed Trump would lose the presidential race and drag down Republican candidates for Senate and the House. \"I believe that Republican primary voters need to understand the opportunity they have to win a very winnable presidential election.\" Dan Eberhart, a private equity and energy executive who is also backing DeSantis, said that he expected Trump's legal troubles to weigh him down, and that he believed most voters were looking for a second choice. \"By the time Super Tuesday comes around, Trump is going to have been beaten in Iowa, and the dam is going to burst,\" he predicted. \"Once someone else is viable, I think you're going to see him quickly melt.\" Then, Eberhart said, donors who have not committed to a candidate will come out of the woodwork: \"They are actively holding their breath, wanting a solution to Trump but not knowing what it is.\" As some donors have cast about for a late entrant to the race who could challenge Trump, the name that comes up most often is Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia. Levine addressed the Youngkin question in his essay, saying, \"Waiting for someone else to get into the race is not an option.\" (Youngkin has not ruled out a run and has said he is focused on Virginia's state legislative elections this fall; with each passing day, the logistical barriers to entry grow higher.) Bill Bean, an Indiana-based real estate executive and backer of former Vice President Mike Pence, said the field would narrow until there was a \"clear alternative\" to Trump. Bean backed Trump's reelection campaign in 2020 and supported the policy decisions he made as president. \"But I would like to see us move forward,\" he said. \"I want to look at the future in a positive way. I hear that a lot more than maybe the poll numbers show.\" This article originally appeared in The New York Times .", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 23:41:54", "image_url": null, "source_id": "startribune", "source_priority": 3221, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "856a3c5a797087228dc73ac936c707bb", "title": "Newsquawk Week Ahead 11th-15th September", "link": "https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/newsquawk-week-ahead-11th-15th-september-20230909/", "keywords": ["Central Banks"], "creator": ["Newsquawk Analysis", "www.forexlive.com"], "video_url": null, "description": "Week Ahead 11th-15th SeptemberMON: Norwegian CPI (Aug)TUE: EIA STEO, OPEC MOMR; Swedish Unemployment (Aug), UK Unemployment (Aug) & Wages (Jul), NorwegianGDP (Jul), Germany/EZ ZEW (Sep)WED: IEA OMR; UK GDP Estimate (Jul), US CPI (Aug)THU: ECB Policy Announcement, Norges Bank Regional Network; Australian Employment (Aug), Swedish CPIF (Aug),US Retail Sales (Aug), IJC (w/e 4th Sep), New Zealand Manufacturing PMI (Aug)FRI: Quad Witching, CBR Policy Announcement, ECB TLTRO Repayment Publication; Chinese Industrial Output/Production, Retail Sales, House Prices (Aug), EZ Trade Balance (Jul), US Export/Import Prices (Aug), IndustrialProduction (Aug), NY Fed Manufacturing (Sep), Uni. of Michigan Prelim. (Sep)NOTE: Previews are listed in day orderNORWEGIAN CPI (MON): The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced.UK UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES (TUE): Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end.UK GDP ESTIMATE (WED): A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought.US CPI (WED): Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern.ECB ANNOUNCEMENT (THU): 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%.AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYMENT (THU): participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms.SWEDISH CPIF (THU): July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak.US RETAIL SALES (THU): Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July. While the data set will offer a glimpse on the health of the consumer amid concerns that the economy may slow significantly in the months ahead, traders will also be watching the University of Michigan's prelim survey release due Friday, where the rise in energy prices is likely to have weighed on sentiment.CHINESE ACTIVITY DATA (FRI): Retail sales Y/Y in August are expected to rise by 2.8% (prev. 2.5%), whilst there is currently no consensus for Industrial Production metrics. The data will be closely watched to diagnose the health of the world\u2019s second-larger economy and to gauge the drip-feed of stimulus seen over recent weeks. Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d.This article originally appeared on Newsquawk This article was written by Newsquawk Analysis at www.forexlive.com.", "content": ": The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced. : Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end. : A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d.

And as you would expect, it's a big hit. In fact, according to Bethesda , it surpassed six million players at release, making it the biggest launch of its history . Of course, it being included with an Xbox Game Pass subscription means this number is inflated. While there's no denying this bit of marketing is a tad misleading, there's also no denying its a major win for Xbox. Further, it's one of the most popular games on Steam right now alongside the likes of Counter-Strike , Dota 2 , and Baldur's Gate 3 . In the past 24 hours, Starfield concurrent players on Steam peaked at 313,993. This was a new time all-time high for it and it remains the high for the space-faring RPG. This is only enough for it to take the number four spot on the Steam concurrent players chart, behind the aforementioned games. However, while it's come up short against some modern competitors, it's enough to top some of its historical competition. Emphasis on some. More specifically, with 313,993 concurrent players, the game soared past Skyrim's peak 12 years ago when it achieved 287,411 concurrent players. Of course, Steam wasn't as popular back then. In other words, there's a very good chance if Skyrim was released today it would blitz 313,993 concurrent players. Evidence of this is Fallout 4 , which achieved 472,962 concurrent players eight years ago. Yet again, while Steam's increase in popularity works in the favor of Starfield , what doesn't is the fact it's available on Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass PC. When the other two Bethesda Game Studios games released, Xbox Game Pass didn't even exist. This is no doubt stealing a considerable number of players away from playing on Steam. What remains to be seen is how well Starfield will maintain this player base over time. Will it be more like Skyrim , which is still relevant 12 years later or will it be more like Fallout 4 , which felt like it came and went? It's too early to tell, but the new Xbox game is off to a good start. That said, with games like Mortal Kombat 1 , Marvel's Spider-Man 2 , Alan Wake 2 , and more looming it may find it hard to maintain this good start. 0 comments", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 22:37:00", "image_url": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2023/07/22/ceaffdff-cb12-4ea8-b71f-5c7b9f95ce77/starfield-skyrim.png", "source_id": "comicbook", "source_priority": 1853, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["entertainment"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "5436f82756349832451714c24a723018", "title": "Trump, DeSantis and other 2024 GOP prospects vie for attention at the Iowa-Iowa State football game", "link": "https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/09/trump-desantis-and-other-2024-gop-prospects-vie-for-attention-at-the-iowa-iowa-state-football-game/", "keywords": ["Latest Headlines", "National News", "National Politics", "News", "Politics", "2024 Presidential Election", "Republicans", "Weekend Wire"], "creator": ["Associated Press"], "video_url": null, "description": "Donald Trump crossed paths with some of his presidential campaign rivals when he attended Iowa\u2019s biggest annual college football game.

Trump waded into one of the state\u2019s largest sports crowds at Jack Trice Stadium in Ames, where Iowa State was hosting Iowa. Also at the game were Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and several other candidates, putting in face time with Iowa\u2019s elected officials and football fans. With the race entering its traditional ramp-up after Labor Day, Trump has largely skipped holding town halls or participating in many of the state\u2019s cherished campaign traditions, but has not paid a price so far. Trump remains far ahead of DeSantis and other rivals in Iowa and nationally. Trump has made a habit of visiting Iowa on the same day as DeSantis, whom Trump treats as his main threat. Both were in and around the stadium before kickoff, reminiscent of the scene last month when Trump drew huge crowds to the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines while DeSantis addressed smaller audiences and hit the midway rides with his family. Trump on Saturday emerged from the Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity, an agricultural house in the middle of Iowa State\u2019s fraternity and sorority neighborhood, where he met privately with students first, to the cheers of hundreds pressing to get photos with the former president outside the red-brick house. Trump basked in the adoration, pumping his fists to the chants of \u201cTrump, Trump, Trump\u201d and \u201cU.S.A, U.S.A.\u201d before strolling to a grill and raising a spatula holding a hamburger. He stopped to autograph photos and about a dozen footballs, which he tossed, both underhand and overhand, into the crowd of cheering students before departing for the game. During the fraternity scrum, Trump approached a reporter with the Republican-leaning Right Side Broadcasting Network, who asked what he thought of the scene. \u201cI guess the youth likes Trump,\u201d Trump said, straining to be heard above the din of the crowd. Trump endured some targeted hits during the day. As Trump\u2019s motorcade rolled on to the college campus before game time, some football fans walking the streets of Ames to the game made profane gestures as it passed. A prop plane flew over the stadium carrying a banner that read, \u201cWhere\u2019s Melania?\u201d And hired performers wearing inflatable costumes, one posing as Trump and the other infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, held hands as they roamed the parking lot in face masks. Meanwhile, DeSantis met fans of both schools at tailgates and said he would be attending the game with Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has not endorsed a candidate but often has appeared with DeSantis and his wife, Casey. \u201cWe\u2019re having a good time,\u201d DeSantis said to reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s quite an atmosphere, probably a little bit more civilized than the Florida-Georgia game.\u201d As he wandered from one tailgate to another, DeSantis was flanked by fans cheering and waving campaign signs from a booth hosted by the pro-DeSantis Never Back Down super PAC. Volunteers with Iowans for Trump similarly set up several booths around the parking lots, with both teams working to get fans to sign caucus pledge cards. Also appearing before the game were candidates Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor, and Asa Hutchinson, a former Arkansas governor, who greeted each other at a tailgate honoring veterans, where Sen. Joni Ernst camped out for most of the afternoon. Asked who he was rooting for, DeSantis said he wasn\u2019t going to \u201cdo anything to upset\u201d Reynolds, who is an Iowa State graduate. Hutchinson said he was rooting for the \u201cunderdog because I\u2019m an underdog in this race and I want underdogs to win,\u201d and Burgum noted his North Dakota State Bison were playing today, though he didn\u2019t risk showing up in Ames wearing his gear. While fans Saturday showed up for football, not for politics, voters have had the chance to see most candidates who regularly appear at Iowa cattle calls and meet-and-greets. DeSantis is increasingly focused on winning or placing high in Iowa and says he\u2019s visited more than half of the state\u2019s 99 counties already. Trump, meanwhile, has made only five visits to Iowa this year. At the game, Trump was sitting in a stadium suite with Iowa casino powerhouse Gary Kirke, an influential Republican donor. Instead of large-scale rallies, Trump is relying on state party events that offer large, friendly audiences at no cost to his campaign, while his political organization pays millions of dollars in legal expenses as he faces four criminal indictments. He was in neighboring South Dakota on Friday night appearing at a state party fundraiser with Gov. Kristi Noem, who endorsed him. Trump\u2019s campaign has also used digital outreach. Last week, Trump held a conference call with tens of thousands of Iowans. He has done some in-person events with voters. In June, he handed out Dairy Queen \u201cBlizzards\u201d while also confessing aloud that he did not know what the soft-serve treats were. There is no comparable example in Iowa political history to a former president running to reclaim his old office while also under indictment for more than 90 felony counts. But other high-profile candidates and strong front-runners have done the town halls and retail campaigning for which Iowa and other early primary states are well-known. In 2007, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton entered the race for the 2008 Democratic nomination as a national celebrity and the party\u2019s heavy favorite in national polling. Drawing larger crowds, Clinton sought to meet the demand by holding smaller meetings with local activists before speaking to packed gyms and halls. Clinton also attended party events with her lesser-known rivals to demonstrate her willingness to undergo the rigor that Iowans typically demand. Ultimately, she lost the 2008 caucus to then-Sen. Barack Obama, who eventually won the nomination and the White House. Trump has foregone all but one such event in Iowa this year. The exception was the Iowa Republican Party Lincoln Dinner in July, a marquee event that helps to finance the caucus.", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 21:27:18", "image_url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Election_2024_Iowa_92354.jpg?w=1400px&strip=all", "source_id": "mercurynews", "source_priority": 2968, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "9116a10964a573efa5e68bbab46d2fcc", "title": "Chris Christie mocks Trump over the former president's desire to 'debate' Meghan Markle: 'Maybe they can have a Spotify broadcast together'", "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/christie-mocks-trump-markle-debate-proposal-british-monarchy-2023-9", "keywords": null, "creator": ["John L.
