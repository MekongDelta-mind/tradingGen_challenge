On Sept. 9, 1850, California became the 31 st state to be admitted to the Union after the Compromise of 1850 was signed by then-President Millard Fillmore. California became a state relatively quickly, as the Gold Rush that started in 1848 \u2013 just days after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed between the U.S. and Mexico, which ceded most of the Southwest and all of present-day California to the states \u2013 led to an influx of settlers, and a hasty constitutional convention was held the following year. It was at this convention that the state seal that we all know today was created. The seal features 31 stars, symbolizing California\u2019s admission as the 31 st state, as well as the Greek goddess Athena, a grizzly bear feeding on grape vines and the state motto \u201cEureka.\u201d Also included in the seal\u2019s complex imagery are nods to what the state\u2019s founders thought were important issues, including mining, farming and water transportation, the California Capitol Museum said . The seal itself was designed by a career military officer named Robert S. Garnett, who later fought in the Civil War in Virginia for the Confederacy and died during the Battle of Corrick\u2019s Ford near present-day Parsons, West Virginia. In the Golden State\u2019s early days, the capital moved frequently; by the time Sacramento was designated as the center of the state government in 1854, the state legislature had already convened in San Jose, Vallejo and the small town of Benicia, according to the California Department of Parks and Recreation . And while Admission Day is now a little-known holiday, it used to be quite a large celebration, the Los Angeles Times said . An undated photo of Echo Lake cityscape over Los Angeles skyline.

Aug. 2023 (NPS) In 1925, Orange County was decorated with Diamond Jubilee colors commemorating the state\u2019s 75 th anniversary, and nearly 200,000 people flocked to the streets of Santa Monica in 1937 to watch a five-mile parade depicting periods of California history. By the mid-1970s, a bill that would have \u201ckilled off\u201d Admission Day made its way to Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s desk, but he vetoed it in 1976. However, the holiday was scrapped in 1984 by Gov. George Deukmejian and turned into a \u201cflabby, floating day off work for state employees,\u201d the L.A. Times said. Regardless of how large \u2014 or small \u2014 the festivities are, a lot has happened since the birth of what has now become the most populated state in the country. Complete with multiple metropolises and a gross domestic product that would rank 5th in the world if it were an independent nation, California has flourished into one of the most important parts of not just the United States, but the entire globe.

The founder of the Inkatha Freedom Party served two terms as minister of home affairs in the post-apartheid government after burying the hatchet with the governing African National Congress party (ANC) in 1994. \u201cI am deeply saddened to announce the passing of Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Prince of KwaPhindangene, Traditional Prime Minister to the Zulu Monarch and Nation, and the Founder and President Emeritus of the Inkatha Freedom Party,\u201d President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a statement. Buthelezi, who was a controversial figure during the apartheid liberation struggle, had a procedure for back pain in July and was later readmitted to hospital when the pain did not subside, according to local news website News24. He founded the IFP in 1975 as a national cultural movement that became a political force in what is now KwaZulu-Natal province, and his party was embroiled in bloody conflicts with the ANC in the 1980s and 1990s. His last-minute decision to participate in the first post-apartheid election in 1994 brought peace between the two parties. The vote brought the ANC and its leader, the late Nelson Mandela, to power after decades of white minority rule. The Nelson Mandela Foundation said Buthelezi\u2019s life intersected at multiple points with Mandela\u2019s and that his legacy was an \u201cimposing and complex one\u201d. \u201cIn many ways, the two leaders came to embody an understanding of a reconciliation which had no need of forgiveness, nor forgetting of the past, nor even of learning to like one another \u2013 it was simply about determining to get on together,\u201d the foundation said in a statement. South Africa\u2019s main opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) party described Buthelezi as a \u201cgreat leader\u201d. \u201cPrince Buthelezi was a giant on South Africa\u2019s political landscape,\u201d DA leader John Steenhuisen said. Buthelezi grew up in a traditional household, spending his early years as a herdboy. In 1953, he was installed as acting chief of the prominent Buthelezi clan and four years later was confirmed as chief. He was married to Irene Mzila, a nurse, eschewing the polygamy followed by many Zulu chiefs. They had three sons and four daughters. Buthelezi was a champion of his people and a prominent figure in the struggle against apartheid but his rivalry with the ANC led to fraught days and much bloodshed before South Africa was able to elect its first Black leader. Critics dubbed Buthelezi a \u201cwarlord\u201d but to his legion of followers in the rural Zulu heartland, he was a visionary. For a decade before the end of white rule in 1994, Buthelezi \u2013 dressed in leopard skins and waving a short silver-topped stick \u2013 was a familiar sight at rallies while Inkatha was embroiled in conflict with the ANC. About 20,000 people were killed and hundreds of thousands forced from their homes as fighting raged in KwaZulu and in men\u2019s hostels built to house migrant labourers who toiled in the gold mines near Johannesburg. The price for peace was Buthelezi\u2019s participation in a government of national unity as minister of home affairs \u2013 a ministry that became a byword for corruption and incompetence under his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s not pleasant, it\u2019s not easy for me. Neither is it easy for President Thabo Mbeki [Mandela\u2019s successor] to have me and my colleagues in the cabinet. We did it to end a low-intensity civil war,\u201d Buthelezi told Reuters in an interview in July 2003. He was also cast in other roles away from politics. Buthelezi played his own great-grandfather King Cetshwayo in the 1964 film, Zulu, which immortalised the 1879 defence of Rorke\u2019s Drift by British troops against thousands of Zulu fighters but also spread the image of the Zulus beyond South Africa as mighty warriors. Longevity marked his political career. He only stepped down as the IFP\u2019s leader in 2019, aged 90. Long-winded speeches were a Buthelezi trademark. Delivered in Zulu or English, they could go on for hours. Attending the Black University of Fort Hare from 1948 to 1950, Buthelezi joined the ANC Youth League and rubbed shoulders in lecture halls with many of the movement\u2019s future leaders. He was expelled for his political activity there. His political clout would be forged in the KwaZulu \u201cBantustan\u201d one of the so-called self-governing homelands based on tribal affiliation \u2013 islands of rural poverty where most Black South Africans were literally confined under apartheid. A Zulu chief, Buthelezi became KwaZulu\u2019s chief minister in the 1970s, where he tried a delicate balancing act: refusing outright independence and criticising Pretoria\u2019s racial policies while still playing a role in the homeland farce. It was too much for the ANC, whose leaders in exile tried to court him throughout the 1970s before giving up in the face of rank-and-file opposition to what was seen as Buthelezi\u2019s collaboration with the apartheid regime.", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 18:52:07", "image_url": null, "source_id": "aljazeera_us", "source_priority": 543, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "a74adcacaaa0f0c037e6088ce2d87ad4", "title": "The Best Memory Foam Pillows To Support Every Type Of Sleeper", "link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/2023/09/08/best-memory-foam-pillows/", "keywords": ["Forbes Vetted", "/vetted", "Forbes Vetted", "/vetted", "Shopping Recirc", "shopping-recirc", "shopping", "shopping", "finds"], "creator": ["Korin Miller", " Contributor"], "video_url": null, "description": "The best memory foam pillows keep your head, neck and spine properly aligned.

This makes them a great option for any sleepers who wake up with neck or shoulder pain (or are just tired of the sinking feeling of down pillows ). According to orthopedic spine and neck surgeon Dr. Rahul Shah , \u201cmemory foam allows pillows to conform to one\u2019s body structure, and this lets the pillow accommodate the natural resting position.\u201d As a result, the pillow \u201cdoesn\u2019t create any undue pressure points.\u201d The best memory foam pillow overall is the Tempur-Pedic Tempur-Cloud because it's cooling, ...

The pillow comes with a separate, solid memory foam insert for an even firmer feel, if you find it isn\u2019t quite enough as is. Prefer a low, soft pillow while you snooze on your stomach? LAYR recommends layering the down alternative insert over the solid memory foam for a dreamy-soft pillow that maintains alignment. For something a little firmer, try removing the down alternative and stacking the memory foam layers. The idea is to add and remove layers until you land on the perfect balance of comfort and support. What the reviews say : \u201cI am a back, side, stomach, everything sleeper and it is perfect for it all,\u201d writes one buyer. Another says, \u201cmy sleep patterns and positions change all the time (I cycle through sleeping on my back, sides, and stomach) and this pillow makes all of those comfortable.\u201d Best Memory Foam Pillow For Back Sleepers A Dense Pillow That Strikes A Balance Between Support And Cushioning Tuft and Needle Tuft & Needle Original Foam Pillow Buy From Tuft & Needle Height: 5 inches | Washable: Cover only | Key features: Greenguard Gold and CertiPUR-US-certified, cooling, multiple sizes The Original Foam Pillow from Tuft & Needle is all the things a memory foam pillow should be\u2014soft, gently conforming and cooling so your head and neck are supported all night long.

From the best mattresses to the softest sheets , our editors have robust hands-on experience with many of these products, including executive strategy editor Lindsay Boyers and senior strategy editor Katie Simpson. Each have spent years formally testing the latest mattresses and bedding products. When it comes to the best memory foam pillows, several of our picks\u2014including the Tempur-Cloud Breeze Dual Cooling Pillow , Tuft & Needle Original Foam Pillow and Coop Home Goods The Original \u2014were tested firsthand by our team. We also consulted with several medical professionals on the impact of memory foam pillows on your sleep and body overall. We spoke to New Jersey-based board-certified orthopedic spine and neck surgeon Dr. Rahul Shah, orthopedic surgeon at Mercy Medical Center Dr. Gregory Gasbarro and assistant professor in the department of kinesiology and health at Rutgers University Andrea Spaeth . Shah and Gasbarro informed us of the benefits of memory foam pillows, while Spaeth provided insight on how memory foam pillows fare for different sleeping positions. This guide is regularly updated to keep it accurate and relevant. It was last refreshed by mattress updates writer Alex Garrett in September 2023 to name a winner for the best firm memory foam pillow and the best adjustable memory foam pillow. How We Chose The Best Memory Foam Pillows The best memory foam pillows were chosen after intensive research and recommendations from Forbes Vetted staff. As mentioned above, the Tempur-Cloud Breeze Dual Cooling Pillow , Tuft & Needle Original Foam Pillow and Coop Home Goods The Original came personally recommended by our writers and contributors. As for the other memory foam pillows on this list, we\u2019re confident they\u2019re among the best because we thoroughly vetted them against criteria like material quality, loft, fill type (shredded, one-piece, layered or contoured), firmness and special characteristics that promote pressure relief and breathability. Each memory foam pillow listed above aligns with our high standards for each of these features and meets the criteria of a quality memory foam pillow. Aside from specs, we prioritized memory foam pillows with great reviews, too; you won\u2019t find a pillow on our list that has an average rating below 4 stars. Finally, we included pillows for a variety of budgets and sleeping positions, so you can easily find an option to match your needs. How Do I Choose A Memory Foam Pillow? Memory foam is among the most popular bedding options on the market, so it can be tough to pinpoint which one is best for you. All memory foam pillows are adaptive, but how you choose one depends on your sleeping preferences. A block of solid foam will be firmer and more robust, so it\u2019s best for someone who stays in one position throughout the night. Solid block memory foam can also be contoured or flat. A flat option is versatile for various types of sleepers, while contoured pillows hold the neck and head in specific positions, so they\u2019re better for people who really stay put in bed. Shredded foam, on the other hand, is softer and more responsive, which is ideal for sleepers who frequently change positions. Is Memory Foam A Good Material For A Pillow? While there\u2019s no perfect pillow that suits every individual, memory foam pillows are a popular option. If your existing pillow sinks while you sleep and you wake up with shoulder, neck or head pain, a memory foam pillow may be a good fit for you because it\u2019s firmer and holds its shape overnight. Are Memory Foam Pillows Good For Side Sleepers? Yes! Memory foam pillows suit most sleeping styles, including side sleeping , because they provide support for the head and neck. Because they contour to the shape of your body, they\u2019re also ideal for individuals who change positions throughout the night. However, there\u2019s not much research to suggest that memory foam pillows are better for any one kind of sleep position, according to Andrea Spaeth, Ph.D., assistant professor in the department of kinesiology and health at Rutgers University. However, she says, \u201cpeople who sleep on their backs may perceive memory foam pillows as more comfortable because they retain their shape.\u201d Ultimately, whether a memory foam pillow is right for you comes down to personal preference, Dr. Rahul Shah says. If you like a really firm pillow, a memory foam pillow may not be right for you, he says. But, overall, Shah says, there are \u201cminimal\u201d drawbacks to using a memory foam pillow.

Readers trust us to provide the most accurate information available, so we consider our own experiences in the field and weigh that against testimonials from customers who\u2019ve tried the loafers, themselves. As a team, we've tried on, evaluated and put a lot of clothing and accessories through the ringer to rate the performance, quality and value for your money. Our passion for high-quality footwear includes recommendations for the best workout shoes for women , as well as other topics, such as the most comfortable flats and the most comfortable sneakers for everyday wear. To make sure you get the most accurate information possible, we regularly update this list with relevant details. This story was last updated in August 2023. How We Chose The Best Loafers For Women To determine the best loafers for women, we read hundreds of product reviews and evaluated options from both established and newer-to-market brands. We ultimately chose the best loafers for women by determining which pairs were consistently top-rated by customers, had attractive design elements and received excellent marks for comfort, support and durability. We also considered if the shoes were available in a wide range of sizes, widths and colors and price points. The final products on this list reflect several weeks' worth of in-depth research and personal vetting. Should I Size Up Or Down When Buying Loafers? The fit around the widest point of your foot (typically the ball of your foot) should feel snug\u2014but not tight or constricting. The same goes for the toe box, which is the part of the shoe that covers your toes; it shouldn\u2019t pinch or squeeze your toes there. If those areas feel tight or uncomfortable, that\u2019s a good sign you might need to size up. Keep in mind that certain materials, such as leather, might feel snug after the first wear but will stretch out over time. If your loafers feel tight right out of the box, wear them around the house with thick socks to help them stretch out a bit. If that doesn\u2019t do the trick, consider exchanging them for a different size. How Do I Know My Size In Loafers? To accurately measure your foot, lay a ruler flat on the ground, with one end touching the wall. Stand with your back up against the wall and note the distance from the wall to the tip of your big toe (or whichever toe is the longest). Record this measurement in inches. Now, measure the width of your foot. Place the ruler back on the ground and step onto it with the widest part of your foot (usually this over the balls of your feet). Record the distance from one end of your foot to the other. After you\u2019ve recorded the length and width, look at the size chart for the loafers you\u2019re considering, and make the most accurate decision. Pro tip: It\u2019s a good idea to measure your foot at the end of the day to account for any swelling. How Do I Choose A Pair Of Loafers? The right pair of loafers for you will largely depend on your preferences. However, the most important things to consider are sizing, materials, comfort and design elements, such as buckles and metal hardware. If you stand all day and need a shoe that minimizes arches and pains, look for elements like a cushioned insole, flexible uppers and arch support. Leather is the most popular material for loafers because it looks polished and wears well over time, but suede and velvet are excellent choices due to their soft hand feel and flexibility. (They\u2019re also a great way to add sophistication to an outfit.) Design elements are a matter of personal choice, and range from statement-making tassels to demure buckles, so make sure to look at all of the options and see what grabs your attention. We always recommend shopping retailers that have generous and hassle-free return policies (if possible), so you can feel the materials and assess the fit before fully committing to any pair of shoes.

In an exclusive interview with ESPN, Bout says he recalled hearing a knock on his cell door and being told, \"Hey, you know, wake up and pack up. You're leaving.\" \"Then,\" Bout recalled, \"I realized, yes, I'm going home.\" Bout, 56, and Griner, 32, were freed and returned to their respective countries Dec. 8, 2022, in a dramatic prisoner exchange on the tarmac of an airport in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Since his release, Bout has declared his support for Russian President Vladimir Putin and the invasion of Ukraine and has been nominated for a seat in a regional legislative assembly in central Russia. Elections there are Sunday. After her release, Griner returned to play for the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury, who host their final home game Friday against Las Vegas, then play their final game of the season Sunday afternoon at Las Vegas. The Mercury missed the playoffs this year, snapping the league's longest streak of 10 consecutive seasons. Russian authorities detained Griner at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport on Feb. 17, 2022, while she was traveling to Russia to play for club team UMMC Ekaterinburg. Customs officials found vape cartridges with oil derived from cannabis in her backpack. There was no public announcement of her arrest until March 5, 2022. Her plight unfolded at the same time Russia was invading Ukraine and further heightened tensions between Russia and the U.S. On July 7, 2022, Griner pleaded guilty to drug charges, saying she accidentally packed the vape cartridges. A Russian judge sentenced her to nine years in prison. Bout was serving a 25-year sentence at the United States Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois, after being convicted in 2011 on four felony counts, including conspiracy to kill Americans. Undercover agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration arrested Bout in a 2008 sting operation in Thailand. The U.S. agents had posed as Colombian rebels trying to buy millions of dollars' worth of weapons, which they said they would use to shoot down U.S. military aircraft. Asked about outrage in the U.S. over the crimes he was convicted of more than a decade ago versus what Griner was convicted of, Bout said: \"Well, think of this, that the same outrage was in Russia when I was sentenced to 25 years. Many people would say, 'For what? Just for talking? Are you serious?' \"There is not even a proper translation to Russian of the crime of conspiracy. We don't have such even the legal term, So, this is this same kind of outrage in Russia about my case and about many other cases.\" Bout maintained that he never intended to sell weapons. According to prosecutors, when undercover U.S. agents told him the weapons would be used against U.S. pilots, Bout responded, \"We have the same enemy.\" Bout said he identified in some ways with Griner and what she might have gone through at the time, saying, \"Of course, I feel, you know, bad or sorry for any person who's going to be used as a pawn, despite whether they committed something or not. \"Publicity is a, like, multiplying factor which can really kill you if you are not strong enough to handle it.\" He said people like himself or Griner sometimes \"pay a price\" because politicians try to \"play chess, on this big chessboard which they call geopolitics.\" Bout said he knew Griner had played for a Russian basketball team and won a Russian championship. He said that he followed developments in her case by watching coverage on CNN, ESPN and other U.S.-based networks while in prison and that he first heard that he might be involved in an exchange deal via news coverage. \"Look, I mean, in United States, I guess, only lazy would not, you know, cover her trial,\" he said. \"Every, you know, talking radio host, every news station, every TV channel on the news broadcast, so this was a big, big deal, I guess, you know, especially in jail.\" At the Abu Dhabi airport, Bout said, he was handed over to Russian authorities as Griner went with U.S. officials. Upon seeing Griner, Bout said, he was surprised to see her without her signature hair -- she cut it while in prison to avoid it freezing during the winter. He said that Griner was \"way taller than me\" and that they shook hands on the tarmac. Russian video of the moment shows the two approaching each other, but it cuts away and does not show them shaking hands as they turn for their respective departures. \"So, I said, you know, 'I wish you good luck,'\" he said, \"and, you know, and we both went to our, you know, planes.\" President Joe Biden authorized Bout's release. The exchange did not include Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine accused of spying and jailed in Russia since 2018. Bout said he agreed to speak with ESPN because he believes the U.S. and Russia \"have a common ground to at least have normal relation between our countries.\" In April, during Griner's first news conference since her detainment in Russia, the WNBA All-Star spoke of her resilience and gratitude and of how she used humor to manage during her experience. The two-time Olympic gold medalist who has played professionally in Russia and China said she would not play internationally again unless it's for the U.S. national team. She also spoke of the need to raise awareness of other U.S. detainees overseas.", "pubDate": "2023-09-08 15:14:15", "image_url": null, "source_id": "espn", "source_priority": 18, "country": ["india", "canada", "united states of america", "australia", "singapore", "united kingdom"], "category": ["sports"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "3c0229503779c50e80c0e4ab701e80bd", "title": "Gold vs. Silver: Which Precious Metal Should You Invest in Now?", "link": "https://investorplace.com/2023/09/gold-vs-silver-which-precious-metal-should-you-invest-in-now/", "keywords": ["Market Analysis", "NYSEARCA:SLV", "NYSEARCA:GLD", "Market Analysis"], "creator": ["Michael A.

The Rich Use This Income Secret (NOT Dividends) Far More Than Regular Investors", "content": "I\u2019ve made the argument here recently that gold prices have a real chance of breaking out of their multi-year range on a potential credit event. But where does that mean for silver, which is often referred to as \u201cpoor man\u2019s gold?\u201d One thing you can look at is a simple price ratio of silver to gold. This ratio can provide crucial insights into the relative value of these two metals and help guide your investment strategy. The silver-to-gold ratio is a simple concept that measures the relative value of silver to gold. You can calculate it by dividing the current price of silver by the price of gold. In essence, this ratio tells you how many ounces of gold it would take to purchase one ounce of silver at current market prices. The silver-to-gold ratio is more than just a mathematical calculation; it\u2019s a tool that can inform your investment strategy. It also has some interesting implications on expectations for economic activity. Gold is more of a risk-off asset, whereas silver more a signal of industrial global demand and output. Should You Buy Silver or Gold? If we look at two ETFs as proxies, iShares Silver Trust (NYSEARCA: SLV ) for silver and SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA: GLD ) for gold, we can see that for the last decade, silver has underperformed gold. Silver prices have been in a tight range all year. When the ratio is high (above the historical average), it suggests that silver is overvalued relative to gold. This could be an indication that it\u2019s a good time to buy gold or sell silver. Conversely, when the ratio is low (below the historical average), it may indicate that silver is undervalued relative to gold, suggesting an opportune time to buy silver or sell gold. From a technical standpoint, it looks like the ratio is right at the midpoint, meaning it\u2019s unclear which outperforms which here. Regardless, the two are co-moving here and could continue to do so as demand for precious metal diversification increases. So, do you buy silver or gold? I think there\u2019s a case for both here, although I lean more towards gold. Keep in mind that investors often see precious metals like gold and silver as hedges against inflation. If inflation expectations are high, both metals may see price increases, but the impact on the silver-to-gold ratio would depend on the relative price changes. The Bottom Line The bottom line here is simple. The silver-to-gold ratio offers valuable insights for those investing in these precious metals. It can serve as a guide for allocating resources between gold and silver and help identify potential investment opportunities. Silver has underperformed gold for a decade, and gold could outpace silver pushing the ratio lower on a flight-to-safety sequence in the yellow metal. This however still likely means silver does well, although it would underperform on a relative basis. I think, broadly speaking, diversifying in precious metals makes sense given where we are in the cycle, and some big movements could be on the horizon.

Jon Loew , Big Media\u2019s co-founder and chairman, who serves as executive producer of Spy Ops, said, \u201cWe are living in a time when it\u2019s difficult to discern fact from fiction, and people are given lots of stories, lots of things to think about our spy agencies, about our government, about our world today,. And I think it is really important to highlight the successful missions of the CIA and other organizations who are working to protect us, and do it in an objective documentary format like ours.\u201d The Project Azorian episode looks at a mission that left people \u201cin shock and disbelief that something this audacious and advanced could be done all while working below the radar and undercover and having it not be exposed until after the initial mission.\u201d After the Soviet sub disappeared, the U.S. found the submarine three miles below the ocean surface about 1,800 miles northwest of Hawaii, although the exact details of how it was discovered remain classified. The basic idea of the operation was to use a large mechanical claw to grab the hull of the sub and lift it via a hydraulic system. It entailed building a ship for the mission, the Hughes Glomar Explorer, with the cover that it was part of the billionaire\u2019s deep sea mining research for manganese nodules. The CIA describes the project to retrieve the submarine this way: \u201cImagine standing atop the Empire State Building with an 8-foot-wide grappling hook on a 1-inch-diameter steel rope. Your task is to lower the hook to the street below, snag a compact car full of gold, and lift the car back to the top of the building. On top of that, the job has to be done without anyone noticing.\u201d The Soviets did not know the location of the sub and, as is shown in the episode, their government officials actually disbelieved the idea that the U.S. would undertake such an expensive and uncertain effort to retrieve it. Robert Wallace, who served 33 years as an operations officer and senior executive at the CIA, said, \u201cEvery intelligence service in the world has as one of its standing requirements to understand as deeply as possible the military capabilities of other countries. The existence of submarines, and particularly nuclear submarines, on both sides and for all parties becomes really a priority requirement.\u201d Wallace, who appears in the series, said that the nuclear capability of the missiles, and the technical details related to their maintenance and operation, \u201cwould have been just golden for their American government to have its hands on.\u201d Spy Ops relied on archival footage, including some of the explorer at sea, as well as recreations and special effects, to depict the operation. Loew said it was a process of \u201ctelling a story where there are elements that are intentionally missing because they\u2019re still classified. So you are taking this fragmented story with bits and pieces of footage, getting most of the story or some of the story by the people [involved], and then having to fill in the blanks and string it along and make it seem like you haven\u2019t missed any of it.\u201d Among those who were assigned to Project Azorian was Sherman Wetmore, who worked for the offshore drilling company Global Marine, tasked with designing, building and operating the explorer. He was put in charge of a group of engineers responsible for the operations of the heavy lift system, the docking system and the well system. The capture vehicle was lowered from the explorer by adding, one at a time, 60-foot sections of steel pipe, until it reached the wreckage. Then the jaws of the capture vehicle would essentially grab the wreckage of the submarine and painstakingly lift it back into the hull of the Glomar. \u201cIt was such a complex system,\u201d Wetmore said. \u201cObviously, a single thread in the whole system was the pipe. If the pipe breaks, it\u2019s game over. And there was no back up and no way to retrieve and finish the problem.\u201d He added, \u201cFrom the very start, we were worried from a design standpoint about the weather, and the soil became unknowns. We didn\u2019t know how much steel was buried underneath the submarine. Therefore, how do we grab a broken piece of iron, that is broken in several different places? That was a guess.\u201d Thousands were involved in the program, but great steps were taken to maintain sercrecy. John Cardwell, who joined the CIA in 1966, became an expert in digital image enhancement, and was critical to providing guidance on what would be optimal conditions for images capturing the submarine. He was assigned to a unit in the Pentagon, where he worked on Azorian and a number of underwater reconnaissance programs. Cardwell noted that there was so much concern of the project being exposed that John Parangosky, leader on the Glomar program for the CIA, never even visited the ship, \u201cjust to ensure that no one of note tainted the mission or the security.\u201d \u201cIt was that kind of intensity of maintaining the cover and maintaining a sense of anonymity as to what you are doing and where you are going,\u201d Cardwell said. After years of development and construction, the recovery operation took place in 1974. The capture vehicle retrieved the submarine section, but as it was lifted and about halfway up to the ship, about 2/3 broke apart, and sank back to the floor. The Glomar team did retrieve what remained of the vessel. Much of what was recovered remains classified, with lots of reports through the years on what was retrieved, including a book and NPR report that two nuclear-tipped torpedoes were found. A suspected cause of the break has been that a few of the claw\u2019s \u201cgrabber\u201d arms broke. In the immediate aftermath, Wetmore said, \u201cof course the first thing is, \u2018why did that happen?\u2019 and [people] start pointing fingers and that wasn\u2019t productive. We made sure that at least if we had something, we would get it all the way up to prove the engineering worked.\u201d The bodies of six members of the crew were recovered, and they were given a formal military burial at sea. That ceremony was filmed, and the footage was eventually presented to Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 1992. Plans were afoot for another recovery effort, but the project was in early 1975 exposed when the Los Angeles Times published a report on it. In a strange twist to the story, the previous year there had been a break in at Hughes offices in Los Angeles, with burglars stealing secret documents that tied the billionaire and his company to the operation. Reporters began to pick up on the investigation of the break in and other rumors, but then-CIA director William Colby had for a time gotten some outlets to withhold the story from publication. Cardwell said, \u201cWhen the first report came out in the L.A. Times, there were a lot of errors in it, and at the time we thought we might be able to ride the storm because we were well underway to rebuilding a rebuilt capture vehicle under the Matador program to go back and pick up the piece that was dropped. We were like 95% confident that that operation would have been completely successful. \u2026We knew exactly what we were going after and how much it weighed.\u201d He said when legendary D.C. journalist Jack Anderson weighed in with a more accurate story and the Soviets then put a ship on the site, \u201cthat was pretty much the death knell of the whole thing as far as I was concerned.\u201d Wetmore said, \u201cEven if we had tried [again], I think the Russians would have been out there somewhere. They were there watching everything we were doing, the whole time we were doing it. I think that was a testament to, one the cover story and two, the audacity.\u201d The total mission cost $300 million to $400 million, or about $2 billion today. That\u2019s a hefty price tag, but those involved still believe it was worth it. The CIA Museum in Langley, VA features a section on Project Azorian, including a recently declassified model of the Soviet sub wreckage that was used in the operation\u2019s planning, as well as manganese remnants and a poster-sized copy of the Los Angeles Times story. Cardwell and Wetmore, who also appear in the episode, joined Wallace on a tour this week. The exhibit emphasizes how the agency was worked with private industry to carry out missions. Wetmore noted that the American Society of Mechanical Engineers recognized the mission as a \u201clandmark mechanical engineering achievement.\u201d \u201cIt was not a boondoggle. It was possible and it worked,\u201d he said. Wetmore said, \u201cIt was explained to me that intelligence and estimating and guessing and analyzing is really a house of cards, and every once in a while you need a ground truth. And this would be one hell of a ground truth. I think we learned stuff just from the metallurgy in the hull.\u201d Cardwell said, \u201cA lot of people now will say that almost any money spent on something that is risky is a waste of money. I disagree with that. We need organizations such as the CIA and the NSA and the DIA and so forth, to really reach out and go beyond what is conventional wisdom and try to solve important intelligence problems.\u201d As the CIA Museum notes, the project did lead to what has become an agency standard response. After the project was exposed, Rolling Stone filed a Freedom of Information Act request for details. The agency then came up with the phrase, \u201cwe can neither confirm nor deny,\u201d known as the Glomar response. \u201cSecrets in an open society are really tricky,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cI like to think of them as radioactive, and I think of them as radioactive in the sense that there are some radioactive elements that decay in a few seconds, and there are some radioactive elements that don\u2019t decay for decades. And I think intelligence secrets are a bit analogous to that. Some of our secrets we want to maintain forever. Many of our secrets they decay fairly quickly. And I think this story, Azorian, is one that merits being told.\u201d", "pubDate": "2023-09-08 14:42:26", "image_url": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/thumbnail_spyops_azorian_Claw.jpg", "source_id": "deadline", "source_priority": 486, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["politics"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "309ccdc8e1ac7e56aa9e35354b147217", "title": "China\u2019s Deflation Heightens \u2018Japanification\u2019 Risks Everywhere", "link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampesek/2023/09/08/chinas-deflation-heightens-japanification-risks-everywhere/", "keywords": ["Asia", "/asia", "Asia", "/asia", "Business", "/business", "Money", "/money", "Asia", "premium"], "creator": ["William Pesek", " Senior Contributor"], "video_url": null, "description": "China\u2019s slide into deflation is an ominous sign for Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia.", "content": "Of all the challenges newish Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda thought he\u2019d encounter in 2023, Chinese deflation wasn\u2019t among them. Since April, Ueda has struggled to manage widespread expectations that the BOJ would exit 23 years of quantitative easing. Those forecasts, of course, were partly based on the near certainty that China\u2019s post-Covid-19 reopening would lead to explosive Asian growth and upward pressure on inflation. The opposite happened. Cratering mainland property markets undermined growth and demand. Now, as investors buzz about \u201cJapanification\u201d in Asia\u2019s biggest economy, officials in Tokyo are doing an about-face of their own. China\u2019s slide into deflation is changing the calculus in Tokyo. The 8.8% drop in Chinese exports in August year on year is an ominous sign for Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia. The fourth consecutive month of sliding overseas sales also means the 7.3% decline in imports is no aberration. Less mainland demand for Japanese goods will dull the benefits of a weak yen. The yen\u2019s 12.3% drop so far this year should have Japanese gross domestic product jumping off the charts. Not so, as China slows, European demand underwhelms and U.S. growth moderates. Instead, China\u2019s trajectory is adding to the reasons why Japan Inc. isn\u2019t fattening paychecks as hoped. As a senior Japanese official told Reuters this week: \u201cWhat's happening in China is worrying and could deal a huge blow to Japan's economy.\u201d Another added: \u201cA downturn in China may diminish the chance of Japan achieving sustained wage growth.\u201d All this leaves Ueda\u2019s team on QE autopilot, at best, and mulling additional easing moves, at worst. Ueda suggested as much late last month, saying China data are coming in \u201con the weak side.\u201d What\u2019s more, Ueda said, \u201cthe underlying problem appears to be the adjustment in the property sector and its spillover to the rest of the economy.\u201d That spillover is clouding China\u2019s outlook at this very moment. Thankfully, Country Garden, China\u2019s biggest private developer, this week narrowly avoided default. But the magnitude of risks facing a sector that can generate as much as 30% of GDP continues to spook global investors. Its stumble echoes that of China Evergrande Group in 2021. Evergrande\u2019s default and subsequent bankruptcy filing spotlighted cracks in China\u2019s financial system. More recent troubles at Zhongzhi Enterprise Group fanned concerns about a liquidity crisis in China\u2019s giant shadow banking sector. All this is generating more than a whiff of paranoia at BOJ headquarters. In the months leading up to April, Ueda\u2019s predecessor Haruhiko Kuroda punted on beginning the exit from QE. Kuroda\u2019s bet was that as China\u2019s post-COVID boom unfolded, it would give Ueda political cover to \u201ctaper\u201d on the way to an actual rate hike or two. Ueda has effectively taken normalizing monetary policy off the table. This is causing the largest Japan-U.S. rate gap since the early 2000s. The current nearly 5 percentage-point difference is well beyond that of 2007, the last time the \u201cyen-carry trade\u201d was the rage in global markets. With rates at or below zero since 1999, Japan became the top creditor nation. It became routine practice for investors to borrow cheaply in yen and carry those funds over to higher yielding assets from Argentina to South Africa to India to New Zealand. The leverage these trades facilitate explains why sudden yen moves can cause panic around the globe . And, in times like this, complicate the BOJ\u2019s policy options. In late December, for example, the BOJ announced the slighter of tweaks to relieve some tension between yen-dollar rates. Yet the move to let 10-year yields rise as high as 0.5% trashed global markets. The BOJ spent the last 10 days of 2023 doing unscheduled and large purchases of Japanese debt to tame markets. And to communicate that QE remains the law of the land. Since arriving on the job 152 days ago, Ueda has been ultra careful not to slam markets. Perhaps too careful, considering that Japan is experiencing its highest inflation in decades. This week, the retail price of gold hit a record high in Japan as households seek to hedge risks. Add China\u2019s slowdown to the mix and Japan faces the specter of \u201cstagflation,\u201d where growth slides as prices rise. Talk about an unenviable turn of events for the Ueda-led BOJ. Throttle back too fast on stimulus as Chinese demand weakens, and the BOJ could be blamed for tipping Japan into recession. Act too slowly to cap inflation expectations and price increases may become permanent. The answer, of course, is for Prime Minister Fumio Kishida\u2019s team to attack inflation from the supply side. Moves to increase efficiency in a notoriously rigid economy could temper price increases. Kishida\u2019s diplomats could seek free-trade deals overseas to slash costs of imported energy, food and other vital commodities. Yet the benefits from such steps by governments tend to take time. This leaves Ueda with one of the worst jobs in global central banking as China\u2019s 2023 goes awry.

This might be about to change after new discovery.", "content": "Researchers at the Zhejiang University in China have devised a new method that allows for easier and cost-effective production of gallium oxide, an alternative to silicon for semiconductors, . The discovery assumes importance amidst the ban on gallium export to China. Silicon may be a significant component powering semiconductor-based applications. Still, the industry has evolved to use compounds such as and indium phosphide in production processes over the years. Gallium oxide is the newest entrant in the arena. What is gallium oxide? Gallium oxide is a fourth-generation ultra-wide band gap semiconductor that can withstand a strong electric field and consumes little power. A band gap is the amount of energy needed to free electrons inside a semiconductor material, and an ultra-wide band gap allows the material to be used for high-voltage applications. Among other ultra-wide band gap materials, such as gallium nitride and silicon carbide, gallium oxide has many advantages. However, its production is much more challenging. Gallium oxide is the only material that can form single crystals at atmospheric pressure after solidification from a melt. This can drastically reduce fabrication costs, but the process needs large amounts of iridium to make a crucible for the melt. A four-inch crucible requires about 11 pounds (five kg) of iridium; since the price of iridium is three times that of gold, this increases production costs. It also raises concerns about intellectual property in China since Japan and the US have used the method. Chinese innovation amidst US ban Last year, researchers at the State Key Laboratory of Silicon Materials at Zhejiang University made two-inch gallium oxide wafers. This year, they have improved their approach and made four-inch wafers. Their improved approach involved a casting method that uses up to 80 percent less iridium. This will help reduce production costs and make the process shorter and more manageable for mass production. The team has spun off a company that holds the patents for these improved methods and is currently working on using a temperature gradient to increase the size of the crystals produced. Due to their low energy consumption, gallium oxide semiconductors are ideal for use in communications, aerospace, radar, and electrified transportation like cars and trains. Last year, the US Commerce Department imposed an export ban on gallium oxide to China, citing concerns about national security since they can also be used for military purposes. The ban aimed to prevent China from gaining experience in next-generation semiconductors, where gallium oxide alone is expected to be a $1.5 billion opportunity by the end of the decade. Not only has China overcome the aims of the ban but, in a tit-for-tat response, imposed a ban on the export of gallium and germanium from August 1 this year. The US-China tensions have also resulted in the Western nations imposing bans on chips from China. Once again aimed at stifling innovations, the move had an unintended effect when Huawei unveiled its newest Mate 60 Pro phone with an . The US imposition seems to have no impact on the Chinese juggernaut. ex", "pubDate": "2023-09-08 12:03:01", "image_url": null, "source_id": "interestingengineering", "source_priority": 9971, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}], "nextPage": "1694174581946465677"}
