Corporations in the United States spend hundreds of millions of dollars every year on well connected lobbyists to influence legislation both on a federal level and in states and cities. Pennsylvania is one of the many states in the US with relatively loose regulations on lobbying and gifts to legislators. For example, lawmakers can accept gifts worth any amount, even cash, from lobbyists as long as they disclose those gifts. These loose lobbying regulations, combined with the unlimited spending on campaign contributions, make it easy for corporations to exert their influence over elected officials in the capital city of Harrisburg. Healthcare has been the number one top sector in lobbying spending in Pennsylvania for at least the past 10 years. According to the PA Department of State, the margin spent over other sectors has only gotten larger . In 2022 , nearly $30 million was spent on direct healthcare lobbying, about $11 million was spent on Medicare and Medicaid, and over $13 million was spent on insurance lobbying. Together, that\u2019s more than the total lobbying spending on energy, the state budget, and education combined. In fact, in 2022, healthcare related entities represented three out of the top five top spenders on lobbying in the state. This spending is driven by large healthcare insurers and hospital systems, many of which have Medicaid contracts in Pennsylvania that are worth billions of dollars. These large corporations and their trade associations use their power to lobby against adequate nurse-to-patient ratios , against policies that hold hospitals responsible for medical malpractice , and lobby against legislation that would require that state Medicaid contractors cooperate in good faith with labor unions. To preserve the status quo and the large revenue stream from Medicare and Medicaid, these companies spend millions on lobbying legislators themselves and also work together through industry trade groups like the Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania and the Hospital and HealthSystem Association of Pennsylvania. Large hospital systems and health insurers have immense power in communities and states not only because of their role in providing critical care, but also because they are typically among the largest employers in their region. The members of the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania (HAP) employ nearly 600,000 people across the state, or about one in 10 jobs statewide . Not only do workers in Pennsylvania depend on the industry for their livelihoods, but the millions of people insured by these companies depend on them to help cover the high cost of healthcare. Yet, these institutions are making billions of dollars in profits for executives and shareholders while squeezing ever increasing premiums out of their customers and refusing to pay many of their workers living wages. Large health insurers like UnitedHealth, Aetna, UPMC, Independence Blue Cross, and Geisinger spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions in the state capitol. In 2022, UPMC spent over $740,000 on lobbying while Geisinger spent over $950,000. Spending even more than both of these healthcare giants was Philadelphia-based Independence Blue Cross. Independence Blue Cross (IBX) is a health insurer based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that serves over seven million people and brought in almost $27.4 billion in revenue in 2022. The corporation has been steadily increasing its spending on state lobbying and hit a five year high in 2022, spending over $3.2 million. IBX spends more than any other entity on lobbying in the state of Pennsylvania. While corporations are not required to disclose what bills their lobbyists work on, Independence Blue Cross\u2019s latest quarterly lobbying report states that it lobbied on issues related to Healthcare, Insurance, Managed Care, and Medicare/Medicaid. Independence Blue Cross\u2019s subsidiary, Keystone First, is the largest Medicaid managed care provider in the state, serving over 400,000 people in Southeast Pennsylvania. IBX also offers Medicare Advantage plans, or privatized Medicare, for Pennsylvania\u2019s seniors. With billions of dollars flowing in from government programs, it\u2019s critical that Independence Blue Cross stay in the good graces of legislators both in the federal and state government. IBX spent over $1.4 million on federal lobbying in 2022. According to Lobbying Disclosure Act reports filed in 2022, the corporation spent most of its resources lobbying on Medicare Advantage, a privatized Medicare program. In 2020, Independence Blue Cross subsidiaries agreed to pay over $2.25 million after allegations that the corporations inflated the costs of their Medicare Advantage programs in their bid to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. An audit in 2023 also found that IBX received over a half million dollars in overpayments through the Medicare Advantage program . IBX President and CEO Gregory E. Deavens sits on the board of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a group that has been lobbying the federal government to avoid cracking down on these types of Medicare Advantage overpayments . In other words, IBX is advocating for the government to allow insurers to commit fraud in Medicare Advantage payments. While these programs are federal, states have the power to regulate and administer them in ways that can either benefit the corporation\u2019s bottom line or not. To ensure the former, IBX hires some of the most well connected lobbyists in the state and its executives and former executives are among the most powerful influencers in the state. The corporation currently has access to 39 registered lobbyists through 10 retained lobbying firms in Pennsylvania. Some higher profile lobbyists include Anthony Costa, son of Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa; Todd Nyquist, former Chief of Staff for former State Senate President Corman; and Megan Crompton, wife of former Republican Commonwealth Court Judge (recently turned lobbyist ) Andrew Crompton. Former Governor Tom Ridge, now owner of the Ridge Policy Group, also now lobbies for Independence Blue Cross. IBX President and CEO, Deavans, also served on the transition leadership team for current Pennsylvania Governor, Josh Shapiro. The Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania is a trade group for large insurance companies in Pennsylvania. Its members include large health insurers like UPMC, Aetna, Cigna, and UnitedHealth and large personal or auto insurers like Erie Insurance, Nationwide, Liberty Mutual, Metlife, and Chubb. Members pay dues that help pay for the millions in lobbying expenses. For example, Cigna and UnitedHealth Group reported spending more than $50,000 each in dues to the Federation in 2022. The Federation is led by Board Chair Brian Bolash, of Erie Insurance, and President Jonathan Greer, former Director of Policy for Governor Ridge. It spends about $2 million per year lobbying in Harrisburg, with the most recent quarterly report showing that it spent over $125,000 on gifts, food, lodging, and transportation for government officials in just three months. The Insurance Federation doesn\u2019t use outside lobbying firms but relies on the political ties of its own staff to influence the state legislature. In addition to the group\u2019s President having previously held positions in the Governor\u2019s Office and the State Senate, the group\u2019s Director of Government Affairs, Noah Karn, has deep ties to the Pennsylvania state legislature. Karn served as the Executive Director of the State House Labor and Industry Committee, Policy Analyst for former House Speaker Mike Turzai, and was the Chief of Staff to Republican State Senator Mike Regan. These lobbyists for the Insurance Federation work on issues that would impact the profits of the insurance giants listed above. For example, the Federation opposed a state mandate that would have ensured telehealth be covered by insurance during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Federation also opposed a bill that would have created a Family and Medical Leave Insurance Program to provide financial assistance to workers on family or medical leave during the pandemic. While thousands of Pennsylvanians were falling ill to Covid-19 and potentially losing income while on leave, the large health insurers behind the Federation were blocking legislation that could have helped ease that financial strain. At the same time, in 2021, Insurance Federation members like UPMC brought in a record $23.1 billion in revenue, Aetna brought in over $7.9 billion in profits, and UnitedHealth Group made over $17.7 billion in profits . The Hospital and Health Association of Pennsylvania (HAP) is a trade association made up of 235 large hospital systems in Pennsylvania. The group spends millions on lobbying efforts every year in Harrisburg and also spends around $300,000 on federal lobbying every year . Most of the nearly $1.6 million that the Association spent on state lobbying was spent on direct lobbying of legislators or advertising materials, but the group also spends thousands of dollars on dinners, lodging, transportation, and/or gifts to legislators and their families. Since 2021, HAP has spent $15,337 on gifts and dinners for legislators according to the state lobbying database . Major hospital systems on the group\u2019s board of directors include UPMC, Highmark, Geisinger, Lehigh Valley Health Network, UPenn Health System, and the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. Together these health systems and hospitals brought in over $500 million in revenue that exceeded their expenditures last year, despite many being nonprofit organizations. Much of the wealth created by these so-called nonprofits goes to top executives and board members. For example, at UPMC, board members and the highest paid employees at the organization were paid a total of $184.9 million in 2022 . In 2021, Highmark Health paid its board and executives nearly $40 million and spent over $10 million on high end business consultants like Deloitte. The Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia gave its board members and executives about $33 million in 2022 . The group\u2019s PAC spent over $400,000 in the 2022 election cycle in Pennsylvania alone. Highmark was by far the top contributor to the PAC, giving over $60,000 from its corporate PAC in one year. The Hospital and Health Association\u2019s PAC, or HAPAC, gave mostly to Republican House and Senate Campaign Committees and Republican leadership, with the exception of $10,000 to Governor Josh Shapiro and a $5,000 gift to fund Shapiro\u2019s transition team . Further, Heather Tyler, Vice President of State Legislative Advocacy at HAP, served on Governor Shapiro\u2019s transition team. The group\u2019s PAC spent over $400,000 in the 2022 election cycle in Pennsylvania alone. Highmark was by far the top contributor to the PAC, giving over $60,000 from its corporate PAC in one year. The Hospital and Health Association\u2019s PAC, or HAPAC, gave mostly to Republican House and Senate Campaign Committees and Republican leadership, with the exception of $10,000 to Governor Josh Shapiro and a $5,000 gift to fund Shapiro\u2019s transition team . Further, Heather Tyler, Vice President of State Legislative Advocacy at HAP, served on Governor Shapiro\u2019s transition team. According to the HAP\u2019s website, the group lobbies for the deregulation of the industry and to limit the liability of hospitals in malpractice cases. In fact, the Association is a part of the Coalition for Civil Justice Reform along with the PA Medical Society, the Pennsylvania Health Care Association, and the right wing group, the Pennsylvania Manufacturers Society (which has significant ties to right wing billionaire Jeffrey Yass). The Coalition collectively spent hundreds of thousands of dollars during the Covid-19 pandemic, in part to ensure that corporations in the state could not be sued if customers or employees were to contract Covid-19 from their business. The Hospital and Healthsystem Association is represented by high profile lobbyists including former Commonwealth Court Judge, Drew Crompton, and founder of the BRAVO Group. Chris Bravacos. Bravacos worked in the Governor Ridge administration as well as for the Republican Party of Pennsylvania, and is the Chair of Excellent Schools PA PAC (funded largely by billionaire right wing donor, Jeffrey Yass ). The immense and often unchecked power of the healthcare industry unfortunately leads to thousands of non-union, low wage jobs, increasing medical debt for Pennsylvanians, and skyrocketing medical costs that keep people from seeking the care they need. A study out of Kaiser Health found that over one million people in Pennsylvania have medical debt. While legislation has been introduced in the Pennsylvania State House to forgive medical debt, it\u2019s clear that the healthcare industry\u2019s army of lobbyists is prepared to protect its bottom line. When faced with invitations to dinners from these lobbyists or campaign donations from these companies\u2019 PACs, legislators must decide, then, if they stand with large hospitals and giant insurers or their constituents that need quality and affordable care.", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 17:45:47", "image_url": "https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1155218108-1200x900.jpg", "source_id": "truthout", "source_priority": 43390, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "f89075a7b7ff21eb4a3a414fa1fd2fc3", "title": "META Stock Outlook: 3 Catalysts That Could Fuel Meta Platform\u2019s Next Rally", "link": "https://investorplace.com/2023/09/meta-stock-outlook-3-catalysts-that-could-fuel-meta-platforms-next-rally/", "keywords": ["Stocks to Buy", "NASDAQ:META", "NYSE:BAC", "Stocks to Buy"], "creator": ["Chris MacDonald"], "video_url": null, "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Here's why Meta Platforms remains a top option in the technology space for long-term value investors in this current environment. The post META Stock Outlook: 3 Catalysts That Could Fuel Meta Platform\u2019s Next Rally appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) had a turbulent 2022, plunging from a high of roughly $380 per share to the $88 level, and then more than tripling in early 2023. At around $300 per share at the time of writing, META stock has certainly become one of the come back stories investors like to see. Those who have held this stock through the turbulence are none the worse for the wear, especially if those same investors bought the stock years ago. Of course, n ews often mirrors stock performance, and it\u2019s crucial to remember the negative headlines about Meta during its decline. Now, optimism abounds for many large-cap tech stocks . That said, investors must consider whether it\u2019s overvalued or rightfully bullish after its roughly 10% decline from its recent peak. Here are three catalysts I think are worth watching when it comes to Meta right now. Meta Platforms is Being Re-Rated Higher Among 42 analysts , 40 rate Mets Platforms stock as \u201cbuy,\u201d with none issuing a recent \u201csell\u201d rating, despite its August decline. Analysts, like Scott Devitt from Wedbush, see potential in Meta\u2019s job cuts leading to improved margins. Devitt notes enhanced monetization in newer areas like Reels and click-to-message ads, setting a $350 price target for META stock. Similarly, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) analysts, with a $375 price target, anticipate renewed enthusiasm for Meta\u2019s stock in 2024 once spending targets are clearer. As more analysts jump on Meta Platforms as a potential long-term opportunity, I expect more price target hikes and upgrades on the horizon. Strong Fundamentals Meta stands out in the tech sector with just 21.6% of its capitalization comprised of debt, a modest figure compared to other tech firms. Meta\u2019s free cash flow, around $24 billion this year , surpasses its total debt of approximately $37 billion, a rarity in the corporate world. This robust cash flow has allowed Meta to repurchase 101 million of its own shares in the past year, benefiting shareholders and boosting stock prices. Meta\u2019s return on invested capital (or ROIC) historically ranged from 15% to 20%, ensuring that the money used for stock buybacks generates similar returns for shareholders. While criticism exists for Meta\u2019s investment in the metaverse, which has yet to yield expected profits, it has lowered ROIC to 14%, still strong compared to many companies. Meta\u2019s robust fundamentals extend to its market share, with Facebook commanding 53.1% of all social media visits (excluding Instagram). This significant presence offers multiple avenues for monetization, irrespective of the metaverse\u2019s success. AI Is The Main Near-Term Catalyst Meta Platforms understands the need for substantial investments in specific areas. It\u2019s a manageable challenge as long as the company can maintain strong revenue growth. While Q2 2023 showed an 11% year-over-year revenue increase, the focus now shifts to what will drive revenue growth in the latter half of 2023 and 2024. Meta Platforms is said to be working on an AI bot for enhancing business customer service and an internal AI tool designed to boost staff productivity. Of course, given the attention around artificial intelligence of late, this has garnered some attention. That said, over the longer-term, we\u2019ll have to see how this actually impacts the company\u2019s bottom line (if it\u2019s more or less like Meta\u2019s move into the metaverse, for example). What Now for Meta Platforms? While Meta shifts its focus to Threads and monetizing Instagram/WhatsApp, the metaverse project might lose some prominence. However, analysts expect double-digit earnings per share growth (around 26.7%) over the next twelve months, which could propel the stock higher, given the historical link between EPS and stock prices. Consider the potential if they redirect metaverse spending is redirected elsewhere, possibly restoring ROIC to its historical levels. This could result in more substantial share buybacks and higher analyst targets due to improved monetization and ROIC. Investors should seize this opportunity.

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Understanding The Difference Between Cash Flow And Profit getty Positive cash flow is critical to a successful business. Business owners may understand the importance of generating profits; however, focusing on profit alone may lead to the neglect of cash flow. Operating a profitable business requires understanding the difference between cash flow and profit. Cash flow and profit are two critical measures of financial performance which businesses must track to survive and thrive but are different in many ways. Understanding these crucial financial aspects will help you operate your business more efficiently, make informed financial decisions, and stay profitable in the long run. Cash flow and its importance Cash flow refers to the movement of cash in and out of your business and preventing cash shortages at any time in your business cycle is critical. It is the steady movement of cash in and out of your business that keeps it alive and thriving. However, preventing cash shortages is also critical to the success of your business because cash shortages can be the death of any business, no matter how successful it may seem on the outside. The good news is that there are ways to prevent cash shortages and maintain a healthy cash flow. By managing your expenses, increasing your revenue streams, and staying on top of your accounts receivables, you can keep your business running smoothly and ensure that cash shortages never disrupt your operations. Cash flow is the lifeblood of your business, so keep it flowing to enjoy long-term success.

Is A Calculated Bet To Fund Troubled Startups The First Step? New Pixel 8 Pro Leaks Reveal Google s Smart Decision Cash flow is critical for the business's day-to-day operations, particularly for small businesses. Having a good cash flow enables the business owner to pay for ongoing expenses such as rent, salaries, inventory, and other business expenses. Without cash flow, your business may struggle to cover its daily expenses, leading to cash flow problems and ultimately, business failure. Profit and its importance Profit is the income earned from sales after deducting expenses like cost of goods sold, rent, payroll, and other expenses. Profitability is a vital concern for all businesses, providing a measure of the business's overall success. Increasing revenue and profit enables the business owner to grow and expand the business, making it more resilient to economic challenges. You likely understand that profit and cash flow are two crucial components of a successful operation. While profit represents the money your business earns after all expenses are paid, cash flow refers to the actual cash coming in and out of your business. It's important to note that profit affects cash flow directly and can either bolster or diminish your cash levels. Put simply, if your business isn't profitable, it will eat away at your cash levels and potentially leave you with a cash flow deficit. Therefore, it's crucial to prioritize profitability in your business strategy to maintain healthy cash flow levels and ensure long-term success. However, an increase in profits may not always translate to good cash flow. For example, if you have made sales to customers who have not yet paid you for the goods, this does not mean that your cash flow is healthy. Thus, the focus on profitability must always be balanced with cash flow monitoring. Monitoring cash flow and profit Monitoring your business's cash flow and profitability helps you keep track of your finances and make informed business decisions. Cash flow projections allow you to anticipate any future cash shortfalls and plan accordingly. On the other hand, profitability monitoring enables you to calculate your return on investment, track revenue growth, and identify areas of the business that may be underperforming. Monitoring cash flow and profitability together will help you prioritize your spending decisions and identify areas of the business that may need attention. The bottom line is that understanding the difference between cash flow and profit is critical for any business owner. While both measures are interrelated, they are distinct financial indicators that measure different aspects of a business's operations. While profitability enables the business owner to grow and expand the business, having good cash flow helps the business survive and thrive. Monitoring cash flow and profitability helps the business owner make informed financial decisions to keep the business healthy and profitable. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

Share-wise, with July showing another great performance, plugin vehicles hit 38% market share! Full electrics (BEVs) alone accounted for 26% of the country\u2019s auto sales. This pulled the 2023 share to 36% (24% BEVs), and considering the current growth rate, we can assume that China\u2019s plugin vehicle market share will end over 40% by the end of 2023. Another measure of the importance of this market is the fact that China alone represented around 60% of global plugin registrations last month! Looking at July\u2019s best sellers in the overall market, we see plugins populating the top positions, with 4 plugin models in the overall top 5. And to think: in other markets, we celebrate when one EV breaks into the overall top 10\u2026. The 20 Best Selling Electric Vehicles in China \u2014 July 2023 Here\u2019s more info and commentary on July\u2019s top selling electric models, again with only BYDs and Teslas in the top 7 positions : #1 \u2014 BYD Song (BEV+PHEV) BYD\u2019s midsize SUV was top dog in the overall Chinese automotive market, with BYD\u2019s current star player scoring 50,440 registrations . Will the Song end the year as the best selling model in the Chinese automotive market? Well, it depends on the competition, especially the internal competition. Currently, the Song only has the recently introduced Frigate 07 PHEV as internal competition, but the upcoming Song L (BYD\u2019s take on the Tesla Model Y theme) and its premium cousin, the Denza N7, are both set to land soon. This is probably too much competition inside BYD\u2019s midsize SUV portfolio (the regular Song as the lower priced model, the Frigate 07 & Song L as mid-priced models, and finally the upmarket Denza N7). Also, the current wave of price cuts, which is spreading through the local market, will be a decisive factor. They will be decisive for the Song to continue clocking 40,000+ sales/month, a necessary threshold to continue leading the cutthroat Chinese auto market. #2 \u2014 BYD Qin Plus (BEV+PHEV) Thanks to a recent refresh and price cut, the BYD Qin Plus has been rejuvenated and its sales have jumped again. The midsizer reached 42,155 registrations in July, with the BEV version alone scoring 11,455 registrations . With prices now starting at 100,000 CNY ($15,000), demand is strong again, despite the fierce internal competition (the BYD Seal for the BEV version and the Destroyer 05 for the PHEV version). Expect BYD\u2019s lower priced midsize sedan to continue posting strong results, at the cost of its most expensive siblings. It should have no problem keeping its most direct competitors, the Tesla Model 3 and GAC Aion S, at a safe distance. #3 \u2014 BYD Dolphin The small-to-compact Dolphin scored 31,650 registrations , a new record for the space-efficient EV. In the past, one could say that the Dolphin had its class all to itself, as its most direct competitors in this category were selling significantly fewer units. This success is now being tested by the recently introduced Wuling Bingo, which clocked a record 19,782-unit performance in July. Once the Bingo crosses the 20,000 units/month threshold, it could give the Dolphin a run for its money. The race in the small hatchback category could become even more entertaining to follow if the upcoming JAC Yiwei 3, said to receive sodium-ion batteries later this year , also becomes a success. #4 \u2014 BYD Seagull With 28,100 registrations , in only its third full month on the market, BYD\u2019s future star player is ramping up fast, with the question now being: How high will it go? In its domestic market it should reach podium positions soon, but it is overseas that the little EV could be a true disruptive force: Latin America and Africa are waiting for a good, cheap EV that can push EVs into the mainstream, and the Seagull could be it. And this could be the model that places BYD among the best sellers in places like India or Europe, where good value-for-money BEVs are scarce. Sitting somewhere between the A and B segments, at 3.78 mt, and using a purposeful angular design, it profits from the brand\u2019s leading Blade batteries, in 30 kWh and 39 kWh sizes. It starts at 74,000 CNY (+\\-$10,500 USD). The only model rivaling it is the slightly larger (3.95 mt) Wuling Bingo, which starts at 60,000 CNY (+\\-$8,200 USD), but at that price, it comes with a battery of just 17 kWh and no DC charging. For a similar-spec Bingo, equipped with a 32 kWh battery & DC charging, it starts at 74,000 CNY, the same price as the Seagull. So, spec-wise, both seem equally competitive, but the Seagull benefits from the current strength of the BYD brand, something that the Wuling EV lacks. Also, does SAIC (or GM) have export plans for this small EV? #5 \u2014 Tesla Model Y Tesla\u2019s star model got 24,351 registrations , which was its best first-month-of-quarter market ever in China, so it seems the price cuts continue to spur demand for the US crossover, which might allow it to reach another record month in September. At a time when Chinese automakers are in peak form, Tesla is currently the only foreign OEM able to follow the amazing pace of the domestic carmakers, with the Model Y\u2019s most immediate threat actually coming from its own stable in the form of the refreshed Tesla Model 3. If the price and specs are anywhere near what is being said, expect the sedan to start cannibalizing its crossover sibling during the coming months\u2026. Looking at the rest of the table, the main highlight in the top half is the #9 Wuling Bingo scoring 19,782 sales, its second record performance in a row, not only beating its smaller sibling Wuling Mini EV, but also now looking to break the glass ceiling disrupt the BYD/Tesla duopoly at the top! The Wuling Bingo could reach the sales levels of the category leader, the BYD Dolphin. Further below in the table, a highlight was in #12, with the Changan Lumin scoring a record 15,262 registrations thanks to a recent refresh. Elsewhere, Li Auto placed all three of its models in the top 20, with the L7 five-seater \u2014 the startup\u2019s smallest model (the L9/L8/L7 are all full-size SUVs) \u2014 having another record month (13,389 registrations) while the slightly larger L8 seven-seater also hit a record result, 11,315 units. Even the Cadillac Escalade\u2013like L9 got an amazing 9,425 registrations\u2026. (Last month there were three models larger than 5 meters in the top 20 \u2014 the Li Xiang L9 & L8 as well as the Denza D9. Talk about automotive obesity\u2026.) The hot startup brand has a winner trio on its hands. The cheapest model in the startup\u2019s lineup (starting at $49,000) should continue to improve its standing in the near future, with Li Auto setting a bullish sales target of 400,000 units this year! And 800,000 in 2024!! And 1.6 million in 2025!!! :0 For these targets to be met, the midsize L6, due to be launched sometime next year, will be a critical part of the puzzle. Still on the top 20, three other models deserve a mention. The #15 BYD Destroyer 05, a reskinned BYD Qin Plus PHEV, hit a record 11,994 registrations, its second record performance in a row. In #18, we have NIO\u2019s new generation ES6, which recently landed on the market with a bang. It scored 10,252 registrations in July, the first five-digit performance in a month by any NIO model. Expect the ES6 to resume its role as the bread and butter model, allowing the startup to scale up its (much needed) production. Finally, after a significant price drop, VW ID.3 sales surged in China, allowing the hatchback to reach the top 20 for the first time with a record 9,093 registrations. Who would have imagined \u2014 cutting prices DOES increase sales\u2026. Outside the top 20, the highlights are varied. In Changan\u2019s stable, the Deepal S7 SUV had 7,704 registrations, in only its second month on the market. A future best seller? The Baojun Yep, a recently introduced pint-sized SUV ( think micro Mercedes G-Class ) delivered 5,305 units of its cutesy baby SUV , in only its third month on the market. Will the SGMW joint venture place in the top 20 soon? Meanwhile, Leap Motor\u2019s C11 midsize SUV scored another great performance, 8,298 registrations, no doubt helped by the introduction of a range-extended version that is now sold along with the regular BEV version. The 20 Best Selling Electric Vehicles in China \u2014 January\u2013July 2023 Looking at the 2023 ranking, the BYD Song is well above the competition, while the runner-up BYD Qin Plus has gained precious advantage over the #3 Tesla Model Y. Will the Chinese sedan continue resisting the US crossover\u2019s pressure? Off the podium, the table has remained relatively stable, with the first position change happening in #6 with the GAIC Aion S surpassing the Wuling Mini EV, thus becoming the first of the non-BYD/Tesla models. In the second half of the table, we have the Wuling Bingo climbing one position to #12, while just below it, another small EV is also on the rise \u2014 the Changan Lumin was up to #13. Below these two, we have two new BYD models in the table, with the small Seagull jumping to #15 in July while the Destroyer 05 is now #19. Finally, we must mention the Li Auto models, with the L7 climbing to #17 and the L9 going up to #19. That makes three Li Auto models in the top 20. Apart from the all-mighty BYD, no one else has that many models in the top 20, and it speaks volumes about the startup\u2019s current strength. Top Selling Auto Brands & Auto Groups in Chinese EV Market Looking at the auto brand ranking , there\u2019s no major news. BYD (35.5%, up 0.2%) remains stable in its leadership position and is looking to win its 10th plugin automaker title this year, while off-peak Tesla (8.4%, down from 9.1%) is stable in second place. Third-placed GAC Aion remained stable, at 6.5%, while the SGMW joint venture\u2019s performance recovered slightly, helped by the \u201c Bingo-effect\u201d pulling its share from 5.8% in June to its current 5.9%. Finally, 5th placed Li Auto continues on the rise (4.4%, up from 4.3%). This three-year-old startup is already reaching significant sales levels and looks set to become a force to be reckoned with in the future. Despite staying off the radar of many analysts, Li Auto\u2019s growth potential, price points, and margins are the most promising among current EV startups. Just to put the company\u2019s amazing growth curve into context, in 2015, three years after the Model S launch, Tesla was celebrating a record 50,000 unit sales a year. At the same age, Li Auto does more than that in two months\u2026. This is kind of a perfect s*** storm for legacy OEMs in China, with BYD and GAC going after their mainstream market volumes, Tesla hitting their midsize/premium offers hard, and Li Auto eating its way into the last bastion of profitability for foreign OEMs in China: full size models. Looking at OEMs/automotive groups/alliances , BYD is comfortably leading with 37.3% share of the market, up 0.3% in July, while #2 Tesla (8.4%) also remains stable. With the SAIC mothership still in the red, the new Wuling Bingo helped to stop the current sales bleed \u2014 the Shanghai-based OEM was up from the 7.4% share it held in May to its current 7.5%, which was enough to allow it to retain the last position on the podium. With #4 GAC (6.9%) getting closer, SAIC could have its bronze medal in danger soon. One step down, #5 Geely\u2013Volvo is slowly growing, now at 5.6% share, up 0.1% share compared to the previous month. With #6 Changan stable at 4.5%, Geely can rest on its laurels for now while it looks for a way to surpass SAIC and/or GAC by the end of the year. (And maybe go after Tesla in 2024?)

Unfortunately, the overall market also grew fast, +17%, as it is finally recovering from a couple of bad years. Last month\u2019s plugin vehicle share of the overall European auto market was 23% (15% full electrics/BEVs). That result kept the 2023 plugin vehicle share at 22% (15% for BEVs alone). BEVs kept gaining momentum in July, growing 68% YoY, its biggest growth rate since February \u201922. Meanwhile, PHEVs (+22%, their highest growth rate this year) also had a surprisingly positive result, which means that both technologies are accelerating their adoption rate. With these two powertrains rising, others must come down , and one of them is diesel, which now has only 14% of the European passenger car market, a far cry from the 50% share it had in 2015 or the 55% average it experienced before that. At this rate, in this category, diesel will be dead by 2027, well before the 2035 ICE ban \u2026. The highlight of the month was the Skoda Enyaq jumping into the 3rd spot. But let\u2019s look closer at July\u2019s plugin top 5: #1 Tesla Model Y \u2014 For the 9th month in a row, Tesla\u2019s crossover was the best selling EV in Europe. In July, the midsizer had 11,748 registrations . This year could be considered \u201cPeak Model Y\u201d in Europe. The midsized crossover should continue to post similar results in the coming quarters in Europe \u2014 but do not expect sales to increase significantly over current volumes, as I am confident the Model Y has already reached the market\u2019s natural limits . Also limiting its growth will be the refreshed Tesla Model 3, which might steal some sales from it, even if Europeans aren\u2019t really into sedans these days. Regarding last month\u2019s performance, the Model Y\u2019s biggest European markets included the UK (2,280 units), Germany (2,067 units), and France (1,631 units), with these countries being the ones posting four-digit results. #2 VW ID.4 \u2014 The Volkswagen crossover won another podium position in July thanks to 8,681 registrations . With increased production availability, the ID.4 now has enough firepower to compete for the #2 spot in 2023, looking to improve on the #3 spot it scored last year. But, will the crossover get there? There have been rumors that demand is dropping, so even if VW now has enough production capability to go after the #2 Tesla Model 3, slow demand could prevent it from doing so. Regarding the ID.4\u2019s July performance, its main market was its home market of Germany (2,941 registrations), followed at a distance by the UK (1,050 registrations), and Norway (975 units). #3 Skoda Enyaq \u2014 The Czech crossover is a sure value in the EV arena, and although the VW ID.4 is now the MEB-platform biggest seller, the good looking crossover has managed to end July in a podium position, and with a record performance to boot. The model had 7,228 sales , an amazing performance for the Skoda EV, especially when we consider that July is a holiday month and most of its competitors are taking a vacation and enjoying some pi\u00f1a coladas\u2026. With this in mind, expect sales to continue strong in the coming months, now that the production constraints seem to have (finally!) ended. Regarding the Enyaq\u2019s July results, the distribution of deliveries between markets was pretty balanced, with the bigger market being Germany (1,896 units), followed by the Netherlands (742 units), Norway (724), and the UK (696) #4 MG4 \u2014 The compact hatchback is fulfilling MG\u2019s best expectations, proving right its dragon-slayer nickname and earning another top 5 presence in July thanks to 6,433 registrations . With original looks, good handling, and good enough interior materials, the Sino-British hatchback is sort of the electric Ford Focus that the US brand has refused to make. With Dearborn\u2019s European arm now little more than an extension of the US marketing team (SUVs = Freedom & Americana ), there is a hole in the B and C segments for mainstream hatchbacks with a focus on good handling and smart design. With the MG4 now filling the role of the electric Ford Focus , who will fill the role of the electric Ford Fiesta ? But I digress. Back to the MG4\u2019s July performance. Its main markets were its adopted home market of the UK (1,850 registrations), Germany (1,193 registrations), and France (1,083 registrations), which incidentally are three big markets for hatchbacks. The remaining markets ended at some distance behind, with the 4th best score happening in Ireland , 565 units. This could mean that production is still not enough to satisfy demand and SAIC is still starving secondary markets. #5 Dacia Spring \u2014 Although it didn\u2019t reach record sales levels, the little Sino-Romanian had a positive month, allowing it to beat its Fiat 500e arch rival and win the city car category in July. With 5,986 sales , a new year best, the popular city car is currently Renault\u2019s cash cow in the EV arena. The only Renault showing up on the table was the Megane EV, in #19, selling almost half of what the Dacia EV had. Looking at July\u2019s performance, France (2,127 registrations) and Germany (1,818 registrations) were the biggest markets by far, followed at a distance by its home market of Romania (828 registrations). Looking at the rest of the July table, the highlights are all in the second half of the table. The #15 spot of the Mercedes EQA was celebrated with a year-best performance from the German model, 3,673 registrations, ending the month above its arch rival, the BMW iX1, which was #16 with 3,454 registrations, again beating the i4 as the highest placed BMW on the table. The second half of the table also witnessed record performances, like the BMW iX1 scoring its second record result in a row, this time 4,158 registrations. That put it in 16th. It is interesting to see that the best selling models from the \u201cThree Marys\u201d (BMW, Mercedes, and Audi) are their compact crossovers (BMW iX1, Mercedes EQA, and Audi Q4 e-tron), which says a lot about current market trends. But it also says a lot about the black hole effect that Teslas are making in the midsize market, stealing sales left and right from the premium German automakers. Will this be just a phase, followed by a bounce back from the Three Marys in a few years, or have they lost their customer base for good? I guess the IAA might start providing some answers\u2026. Below the top 20, we had several models with positive performances, like the VW ID.5 reaching 2,477 registrations. In the full size category, the Audi Q8 e-tron continued to remain in charge, thanks to July\u2019s 2,523 registrations. There was also good news in the Hyundai\u2013Kia stable, with the Hyundai Ioniq 5 (2,801 units) and Kia EV6 (3,240) helping their respective makes with solid results. The BYD Atto 3 (export spec BYD Yuan Plus) had its best score this year, 1,643 registrations. Has BYD finally started to deliver in European markets with relevant volumes? Finally, in the Stellantis stable, despite weak results from its best sellers \u2014 the Fiat 500e was only 8th, while the Peugeot e-208 didn\u2019t even make the top 20 \u2014 the Stellantis highlight this month came from Jeep, with the little Avenger EV scoring 1,455 deliveries in only its third month on the market. Expect for the Polish-made American model to start knocking at the door of the top 20 in a few months. Looking at the 2023 ranking , with the Tesla Model Y having three times as many deliveries as the new runner-up VW ID.4, the attention is now focused on the remaining podium positions. On that topic, the VW ID.4 jumped two positions in July, to 2nd place, removing the Model 3 from the silver medal spot. If the upcoming refresh of the Tesla sedan is as disruptive as rumors say it will be, namely price-wise, then the German crossover will have a hard time holding onto silver. Speaking about the #4 Volvo XC40, it is probably already suffering from the comparison with Volvo\u2019s newborn EX30, of which its 7th position in July could be an early sign of fatigue and future cannibalization. Elsewhere, let\u2019s look at the remaining position changes. The MG4 continues to climb up the table, having risen two positions in July to #6, immediately followed by another value-for-money champ , the Skoda Enyaq, which jumped from 9th in June to 7th now. (And what do you know \u2014 apparently there is a market for EVs that focus on value for money. Well, color me amazed!) The Ford Kuga PHEV was up one position, to #11, while its direct competitor, the Kia Niro, also climbed up the table \u2014 in this case, to #14. In the last positions of the table, the highlight is the rise of the Polestar 2, which was up to #17 and now has its sights set on the #16 BMW i4. So, not only us the i4 having its derri\u00e8re kicked by the Tesla Model 3, but now it is seeing the Polestar 2 coming closer and closer. And let\u2019s not forget that the Kia EV6 (#21) and Hyundai Ioniq 5 (#25) aren\u2019t that far behind either\u2026. (Well, at least BMW is trying, even if the i4 is just a placeholder model. Mercedes will only come to play next year \u2014 with the new CLA \u2014 while Audi is only bringing the A4 e-tron to market \u2026 in 2026.) Still in the top 20, the Cupra Born was up to #18. We can also celebrate the arrival of the Mercedes EQA onto the table, in #20, but the three-pointed-star model cannot rest on its laurels, because the arch rival BMW iX1 (in #22) is also rising and could surpass it soon. In the auto brand ranking , Tesla is leading with a comfortable 12.31% share of the plugin market, down 0.8% compared to its peak in June. Volkswagen is in the runner-up position with 8.6%, up 0.1% compared to the previous month. 3rd placed BMW (8%, up from 7.9%) has kept its lead over Mercedes (7.5%, up from 7.4%), but with only 0.5% share separating the two, a lot can still happen between them. Finally, Volvo (6.1%, down from 6.2%) is still comfortable in 5th but is losing share by the day. So, we might see #6 Audi (5.4%, up from 5.3% in June) surpass it sometime in the future. Arranging things by automotive group , Volkswagen Group was up to 20.3%, from 19.9% in June, keeping a comfortable lead over runner-up Stellantis (14.1%, down 0.2% from the previous month). Off-peak Tesla dropped from 13.1% to 12.3%, but expect the US automaker to try and go after the #2 position in September, looking to profit from Stellantis\u2019 apparent weakness. Off the podium, #4 BMW Group was up to 9.6%, while #5 Geely\u2013Volvo suffered from the poor performance from Volvo and dropped 0.1% share, to 8.7%. With #6 Mercedes-Benz Group (8.4%, up from 8.3%) and #7 Hyundai\u2013Kia (8.3%, up 0.1%) on the rise, Geely might be ousted from its 5th spot in the next few months.

Do this now.", "content": "Half the fun of investing in stocks is digging through the markets to find undervalued gems and under-the-radar stocks with long-term potential. At the same time, markets are complex and the depth of information available is overwhelming. \u201cParalysis by analysis\u201d is a real affliction. It particularly affects newer investors as they learn how to separate the wheat from the chaff in under-the-radar stocks. As with any long-term investment strategy, three things matter. First, consider the broad economic conditions. Today, in an era of high(ish) interest rates and economic uncertainty, growth stocks and tech stocks are struggling. Depending on your risk appetite, this can present an opportunity to buy great stocks at bargain prices. Second, underlying fundamentals and financials matter \u2013 particularly in a tight economy. If a company can\u2019t withstand brief uncertainty based on its current financials, it doesn\u2019t matter how great its potential is. To that end, consider the long-term potential. Does the company have a viable product or service that\u2019s in demand and fairly protected from competition? These three companies have fundamental strength and long-term viability to weather (or even thrive) in today\u2019s economy. Each represents a perfect under-the-radar stock for those hunting for overlooked treasure. Under-the-Radar Stocks: Howmet Aerospace (HWM) Howmet Aerospace (NYSE: HWM ) is an aerospace company that manufactures and produces various materials and components for aircraft and aerospace end items. Of course, with space stocks set to hit a net value between $1 trillion and $10 trillion in the next few years, Howmet\u2019s long-term viability as a partner to major aerospace companies is clear. Today, Howmet ensures operational success through diversified products in the trucking industry. As global companies race to tighten up strained supply lines, trucking is a vital link in the chain. Likewise, by producing components for the trucks themselves, Howmet is vital to operational success even as trucking companies pivot to unmanned and autonomous operations . Howmet is financially successful and posted a profit in each of the past three years , with its most recent quarter marking a record $193 million net income . Its cash balance is also healthy, and the aerospace company has enough money to weather occasional down periods if they arise. SharkNinja (SN) SharkNinja (NYSE: SN ) is the definition of an under-the-radar stock, as it snuck onto exchanges via a spinoff in July to limited investor attention. The company might not be at the top of market players\u2019 minds, but it\u2019s a staple in kitchens and homes globally. The company makes and sells a range of appliances, including coffee makers, ice cream machines and hair dryers. Although firmly within consumer discretionary categories, the sluggish economy hasn\u2019t slowed SharkNinja. Instead, the company\u2019s sales have risen 20% each year since 2008. This year, management expects the trends to continue as trends point to $4 billion in revenue by December. Shares trade at a discount compared to similar, semi-luxury appliance brand competitors. Institutional investors are slowly taking note because of the company\u2019s broad appeal, proven strategy and financial readiness. One portfolio manager from Madison Avenue Partners said that SharkNinja is \u201ca gem that\u2019s about to be discovered,\u201d because \u201cSharkNinja has been able to produce new products in categories that haven\u2019t seen much innovation at attractive prices that delight consumers.\u201d Ultimately, any company able to sell higher-end discretionary products in today\u2019s economy is noteworthy. SharkNinja\u2019s success points to long-term upside potential for this under-the-radar stock. Robert Half Inc (RHI) The global job and labor market is changing, and firms like staffing agency Robert Half Inc (NYSE: RHI ) are positioned to ride the new trend to success. Notably, the company is pivoting away from low-margin activities, like temporary staffing solutions, and rotating into long-term contract sourcing. Notably, contract-to-hire models represent much higher margins for Robert Half. At the same time, they ensure a long-term revenue stream as the client and contractor\u2019s relationship matures. Likewise, these roles open opportunities for Robert Half to partner with more professional, skilled and experienced contractors. Ultimately, the move increases value to the client\u2019s organization and cements RHI\u2019s position in their workflow. Small business outsourcing is already booming, and digitization means Robert Half can deliver expertise to small business owners globally, no matter how remote the business is or how lacking local talent pools are. This demand makes matchmaking essential, and Robert Half is particularly well-suited to capitalize on emerging trends. This company and the ones listed above are all under-the-radar stocks that you should consider for your portfolio.

The Ryan Cohen SEC probe may not be the only reason for these declines, but it certainly isn\u2019t helping things. As InvestorPlace contributor Dana Blankenhorn reports , GameStop now trades \u201cbased on its fundamentals as a no-growth and marginally profitable retailer.\u201d That\u2019s concerning enough on its own. But with Cohen\u2019s legal problems causing further uncertainty, investors will have even more reason to approach shares with caution. The fact that both GME stock and fellow meme favorite AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC ) are falling amid the probe news should remind investors just how unstable meme stocks can be. Last August, Bed Bath & Beyond had surged to impressive heights on short squeeze momentum. When Cohen offloaded his massive stake in the company, though, it shocked markets. This quickly led to an outcry from investors and attempts at legal action . The Wall Street Journal reports: WSJ also notes that SEC investigations can be long and complicated. While GME stock may bounce back from the current downward momentum on retail investing energy, some institutional investors may be liable to jump ship. All of this suggests that darker days are ahead for the video game retailer. Despite its forays into non-fungible token (NFT) markets, among other fields, it\u2019s important to remember: At its core, GameStop is a plastic disc retailer with an outdated business model. Now, investors have even more reason to run the other way before shares fall further. Regardless of what the probe turns up, Cohen\u2019s credibility is also at risk of being compromised.

[ Read More ]", "content": "I took a chance on purchasing a no-frills \u00a312 tether cable to see how it performs in comparison to other well-known brand cables. If you shoot tethered, you might want to read on. The pursuit of perfection often leads us down the path of expensive gear and accessories, which can eat into a photographer's profit margins. One such accessory is the tether shooting cable, an indispensable tool for photographers looking to maximize their workflow and shooting process. I don\u2019t know about you, but tether cables and reflectors are high on my danger list of items that I seem to leave behind after a shoot. I am forever replacing them, so if there is a good option at a lower cost, I\u2019m willing to give it a try. As it stands, a certain orange-colored tether cable dominates the market, commanding premium prices for this useful piece of kit, which, depending on the area of photography you practice in, may or may not be considered an essential tool. In contrast to this, the Valueline tether shooting cable, in a bright shade of blue, caught my attention as a cost-effective alternative to the orange-clad name-brand cables, which cost an average of \u00a350. Skeptical but curious, I decided to give it a shot, and the results left me pleasantly surprised. You may have noticed this yourself, but when the word photography is added to the description of a product, the price tends to creep up. This is not advertised as being a photographic tether cable, but that is exactly what it is, and tethering your camera for instant image review on a monitor is exactly what it does. Of course, different connections are available for different camera and monitor or laptop connections, but throughout all options, the price stays very low. I paid \u00a311.86 for this cable, but it is currently on offer for \u00a39.92, and I will be purchasing a spare as soon as I finish typing this article. Shooting tethered, the practice of connecting your camera to a computer or monitor during a photoshoot, offers numerous advantages that enhance a photographer's workflow. Here are some key benefits: Shooting tethered enables instant viewing of images on a larger screen, allowing for a more accurate assessment of composition, exposure, and focus. The larger screen helps identify and address any issues with images that might go unnoticed on the small LCD on the back of your camera. Clients, art directors, or models can view images as they are captured, fostering better communication and collaboration on set. Images are transferred directly to the computer, reducing the risk of data loss due to memory card failure. Photographers can make real-time adjustments to camera settings from the computer, streamlining the creative process. After a fortnight of use, this cable has delivered exceptional performance without burning a hole in my pocket. Priced at a fraction of the cost of the orange cables, this budget-friendly option allows photographers to allocate their resources elsewhere. This article is a rather long way to say \u201cit works.\u201d Granted, I have only used it over the course of a few weeks, but it has already outlasted one of the more costly tether cables I purchased a few years back that kept disconnecting after only a few weeks of use. A final point to consider, which may be a minor point, is that other professionals will recognize the color as being out of place with what they are used to seeing. Will this give an impression of inferiority? It shouldn\u2019t, but would you judge a person\u2019s professionalism if they are using an off-brand data transfer cable? In a world where quality need not always come at a premium, this cable serves as a testament to the value that can occasionally be found in affordable solutions. If you are anything like me, you will need a spare for occasions when you leave your cable behind, or if your cable malfunctions, so at the very least this will be an ideal option in that scenario. If you're in the market for a reliable and cost-effective tether shooting cable, don't hesitate to give the brand a try; you might just find yourself as pleasantly surprised as I was.

Hammonds at Spring 2023 event ... [+] \"Cocktails and Conversations\" held in Manhattan Fashinnovation As we head into New York Fashion Week (NYFW), let\u2019s hope that things are looking better than last season when it comes to body size representation. Back in Spring, NYFW was getting called out for some of the lowest plus-size visibility on the runway in recent history. Meanwhile Noir Fashion Week (NFW) was highlighting underrepresented designers - and underrepresented bodies - at the very same time in New York. Nichole M. Bess is the founder of Noir Fashion Week. She sees her brainchild as a response to the lack of diversity in the fashion world broadly and at NYFW specifically. Bess says that NFW is a platform for the \u201coverlooked and what some would deem as underqualified. I see NFW as an opportunity to uncover the diamond in the ruff.\u201d Noir Fashion Week was built on Bess\u2019 love of fashion and her drive to give global visibility to marginalized people. At 19, Bess was interning with Russell and Kimora Lee Simmons as a fashion designer. They later introduced her to Naomi Campbell, which ultimately led to a pivot into public relations. \u201cI started my own PR firm right before my 20th birthday,\u201d shares Bess. \u201cAs I was studying to become a fashion designer, I found a love for making dreams come true through the power of media visibility and storytelling. As a budding publicist I knew this was why I was created. I committed full-time to this newfound passion and went all in. I booked clients like Wolford, Saks Fifth Avenue, Betsey Johnson , Agatha of Paris, Deon and Pilar Sanders and many more.\u201d Bess says she hopes that NFW will outlive her and become known as the springboard to careers like those of her mentors, Christopher John Rogers , Fe Noel and LaQaun Smith , who in 2022 became the first to stage a fashion show inside the Empire State Building. Though NYFW began in 1943, it became the fashion week we know today 50 years later under the banner of the Council of Fashion Designers of America . The lack of BIPOC representation among NYFW designers and models has received extensive critique, pointing to the fact that even when these designers get shows they receive less media coverage and fewer resources . Bess says she sees NFW as a \u201cstop gap\u201d and \u201cthe bridge between the dream and a new reality.\u201d She believes that part of the problem with the fashion world is that BIPOC designers are often unable to afford a well-rounded fashion education or haven\u2019t been equipped with the professional tools they need to take their talent to the next level. She has plans to solve for some of these challenges by launching a non-profit organization that will assist in locating grants, classes, books and international studies for emerging BIPOC designers globally.

Even if \u2018they\u2019 have their nose turned up at you, they still want to know who and why you are.

Jordana Guimar\u00e3es , Co-founder of Fashinnovation, says she was eager to support NFW when she found out about Bess in 2022. She believes that the fashion industry needs to talk less and do more when it comes to diversity, equity and inclusion. \u201c(Things) needs to change if we're going to see the future we want in fashion,\u201d says Guimar\u00e3es. \u201cEveryone deserves to see themselves in fashion.

Cryptocurrencies have become a\u2026", "content": "Cryptocurrencies have become a prominent investment strategy for many traders, but what if you believe that the price of a particular cryptocurrency, such as , is likely to decline? In that case, shorting crypto might be a strategy worth considering. Shorting, also known as short selling, allows traders to profit from a cryptocurrency\u2019s price decline. This comprehensive guide will explore a common question: \u201cHow to Short Crypto in the United States?\u201d However, it is important to understand the risks associated with shorting before diving into this investment strategy. Shorting crypto involves borrowing a cryptocurrency and selling it at the current market price, intending to repurchase it at a lower price in the future. The difference between the selling and repurchase prices is the trader\u2019s profit. Shorting can be done through various methods, including margin trading, futures trading, and perpetual contracts. How to Short Crypto in the United States? Margin trading is one of the easiest ways to short crypto. It involves borrowing funds from a broker or a cryptocurrency exchange to make a trade. With margin trading, traders can open larger positions and potentially increase their profits. Many exchanges and brokerages offer margin trading options, including popular platforms like Kraken and Binance. To short crypto through margin trading, traders need to open a margin trading account with a platform that supports this feature. They can then borrow funds from the platform to sell the desired cryptocurrency. If the cryptocurrency\u2019s price decreases, traders can repurchase it at a lower price, return the borrowed funds, and keep the difference as profit. It\u2019s important to note that margin trading involves leverage, which amplifies profits and losses. Traders should carefully manage their positions and use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Futures trading is another method for shorting crypto. In futures trading, buyers agree to purchase a cryptocurrency at a specified price and time. On the other hand, sellers agree to sell the cryptocurrency at the specified price and time. If a trader believes that the price of a cryptocurrency will decline, they can sell futures contracts to profit from the expected price decrease. The futures market for Bitcoin has grown significantly in recent years, with various platforms offering Bitcoin futures trading. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), one of the largest derivatives trading platforms, provides Bitcoin futures contracts. Additionally, cryptocurrency exchanges like Kraken and BitMEX also offer futures trading options. Traders can short crypto by selling Bitcoin futures contracts, betting on a lower price for the cryptocurrency in the future. If the price decreases as predicted, traders can buy back the futures contracts at a lower price, realizing a profit. Perpetual contracts are similar to futures contracts but do not have a fixed expiration date. These contracts are designed to continuously track the price of an underlying asset. Traders can use perpetual contracts to short crypto by selling the contracts and repurchasing them at a lower price. Platforms like Covo Finance offer decentralized trading of perpetual contracts, allowing traders to open and close leveraged positions on various cryptocurrencies. Covo Finance does not require users to deposit their assets and offers up to 50X leverage on crypto perpetual. Traders can select \u201clong\u201d or \u201cshort\u201d positions, depending on whether they expect the price to go up or down. Covo Finance charges trading and borrowing fees, which are deducted at the start of every hour. Now that we have a basic understanding of shorting crypto, let\u2019s explore some popular methods and platforms for shorting cryptocurrencies. Binance is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world and offers margin trading options for traders. Through Binance\u2019s margin trading platform, users can borrow funds to open larger positions and potentially profit from price declines. To short crypto on Binance, traders must open a margin trading account and deposit funds. They can then borrow funds and sell the desired cryptocurrency. If the price decreases, traders can repurchase the cryptocurrency at a lower price, return the borrowed funds, and keep the difference as profit. Binance offers a variety of trading pairs and supports up to 100x leverage for margin trading. However, it\u2019s important to note that margin trading involves higher risks, as leverage can amplify gains and losses. Traders should carefully manage their positions and set stop-loss orders to mitigate potential losses. Kraken is another popular platform that allows traders to short crypto through futures trading. Kraken offers Bitcoin futures contracts, which traders can sell to profit from anticipated price declines. To short crypto on Kraken, traders must open a futures trading account and deposit funds. They can then sell Bitcoin futures contracts, betting on a lower price for the cryptocurrency. If the price decreases as predicted, traders can repurchase the futures contracts at a lower price, realizing a profit. Kraken charges spot fees, opening fees, and rollover fees for futures trading. Traders should carefully consider these fees and manage their positions accordingly. Covo Finance is a decentralized trading platform that offers perpetual contracts for shorting crypto. Traders can open and close leveraged positions on various cryptocurrencies without depositing their assets. To short crypto on Covo Finance, traders can select \u201cshort\u201d positions on the platform and sell perpetual contracts. If cryptocurrency prices decrease, traders can repurchase the contracts at a lower price, realizing a profit. Covo Finance charges trading fees and borrowing fees for perpetual contracts. Traders should carefully monitor their positions and manage their leverage to mitigate potential losses. Binary options trading is another method for shorting crypto. It involves executing put orders, allowing traders to sell a cryptocurrency at today\u2019s price even if the price drops. Several offshore exchanges offer binary option trading for cryptocurrencies. Traders can purchase put options and profit if the cryptocurrency price decreases as expected. However, it\u2019s important to note that binary options trading can be costly and risky. Traders should consider the costs and risks involved before using this method. Prediction markets provide another avenue for shorting crypto. In prediction markets, traders can place bets on the outcome of events, including the price movement of cryptocurrencies. Traders can predict that the price of a cryptocurrency will decline by a certain margin or percentage. If someone takes up the bet, the trader profits if the prediction comes true. Popular crypto prediction markets include Augur, GnosisDAO, and Polymarket. Traders should carefully assess the market conditions and make informed predictions before engaging in prediction market trading. Before deciding to short crypto, it\u2019s essential to understand the risks associated with this investment strategy. Shorting involves predicting the price movement of cryptocurrencies, which can be highly volatile and unpredictable. Here are some important considerations and risks to keep in mind: Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are known for their volatility. Prices can experience significant fluctuations, making it challenging to predict price movements accurately. Traders should be prepared for sudden increases or decreases in the price of cryptocurrencies when shorting. The regulatory status of cryptocurrencies, including their shorting options, varies across jurisdictions. Some platforms and trading options might not be available or regulated in certain countries. Traders should know the regulatory landscape and ensure compliance with local laws when shorting crypto. Margin and futures trading involve leverage, which can amplify profits and losses. While leverage can increase potential gains, it also increases the risk of significant losses. Traders should carefully manage their positions, set stop-loss orders, and only use the leverage they can afford to lose. Cryptocurrency markets are still evolving, and the regulatory framework is not yet fully established. Some platforms might not offer the same level of legal protection as traditional financial markets. Traders should know the limited legal recourse available in disputes or losses. Understanding different order types, such as stop-limit orders, is crucial when shorting crypto. These order types can help limit losses if price trajectories do not align with initial predictions. Traders should familiarize themselves with order types and use them effectively to manage their positions. : How to Short Crypto in the United States? In conclusion, shorting crypto can be an attractive investment strategy for traders who believe that the price of a particular cryptocurrency will decline. However, it is essential to understand the risks involved and carefully manage positions when engaging in shorting activities. Especially when asking the core question, \u201cHow to Short Crypto in the United States?\u201d Various methods and platforms are available for shorting crypto, including margin trading, futures trading, perpetual contracts, binary options trading, and prediction markets. Traders should choose the method and platform that best suits their needs and risk tolerance. Conduct thorough research, analyze market conditions, and make informed predictions before shorting crypto.
