Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Google is testing three significant new Google Photos features SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Google is testing out a selection of new Google Photos features that can make it easier to share photos and videos with your partner, tidy up your photo library and make sure you don\u2019t miss important events. The details come, once again, from app expert AssembleDebug , now publishing their findings on their own blog. This information has been revealed through analyzing the underlying code of the Google Photos app, which can sometimes unearth inactive code snippets and text pertaining to unreleased features, such as those detailed below: Improvements To Partner Sharing A new sharing shortcut is being tested that would let you share an album with your partner in a single tap instead of having to navigate your way through the sharing menu to select your partner from a list. After nominating one of your contacts to be your partner from an initial setup screen, you will be able to share media directly with that person using a new shortcut. According to the report, this feature doesn\u2019t support adding more than one contact to your sharing shortcuts. Confusingly, the partner shortcut function is entirely different from the Google Photos \u201cPartner Sharing\u201d feature, which enables users to automatically share photos and videos with a partner\u2019s account as they are backed up. MORE FOR YOU How Deep Is Your Love McIntosh Launches Its Behemoth Of Bass Bang Olufsen Unveils Its New Beolab 8 Wireless Speaker An AI Created Song Is Looking To Make History With A Grammy Nomination Archive Albums Automatically Another new feature allows you to have albums automatically moved to the archive (see below) after a period of thirty days. Personally, I\u2019m not sure why users would want this feature, but Google clearly thinks it\u2019s important enough to warrant testing. What Is The Google Photos Archive? The Google Photos archive is a place where you can store albums, photos and videos that you don\u2019t want to have show up when scrolling through your library. It will also ensure that they don\u2019t appear in any automatically created movies or animations. For even greater security, you can move content to the Locked Folder instead, which locks your pictures behind an extra passcode challenge. Both the archive and the locked folder can now be backed up online . Calendar Integration - Reminders And Events Also lurking in the code are hints at a new function to create reminders in your Google Calendar directly from Google Photos. The code reveals the ability to create calendar events with configurable time, title and duration fields as well as a permission request message that reads: \u201cThe Google Photos app needs access to your calendar to let you create calendar events, like setting reminders. On the following screen, change your calendar permissions from Don\u2019t Allow to Allow.\u201d Again, it\u2019s not clear how Google would use this ability; perhaps there could be integration between the Google Photos \u201cMemories\u201d feature and Google Calendar or, as AssembleDebug postulates, the ability to scan photos for appointments and invitations and automatically convert them into calendar events. For example, you could take a photo of an appointment letter or party invitation and have Google Calendar automatically send you timely reminders without you having to enter the information manually. Both auto-archiving and Google Photos reminders are likely to appear as exclusives for paying Google One customers, given that text within the app code reads, \u201cAs a Google One member, you can unlock reminders, auto-archive, and more.\u201d It\u2019s important to remember that these features aren\u2019t currently enabled in the Google Photos app and, as they are just tests, may be subject to significant change\u2014if they ever roll out at all. I certainly hope they do, though. The partner shortcut alone would eliminate a lot of repetitive effort, and who knows what important meetings the reminder function might save you from missing?

The proliferation of sensors in automobiles \u2014 from telematics to fully digitized control consoles \u2014 has made them prodigious data-collection hubs. But drivers are given little or no control over the personal data their vehicles collect, researchers for the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation said in their latest \u201cPrivacy Not Included\u201d survey. Security standards are also vague, a big concern given automakers\u2019 track record of susceptibility to hacking. \u201cCars seem to have really flown under the privacy radar and I\u2019m really hoping that we can help remedy that because they are truly awful,\u201d said Jen Caltrider, the study\u2019s research lead. \u201cCars have microphones and people have all kinds of sensitive conversations in them. Cars have cameras that face inward and outward.\u201d Unless they opt for a used, pre-digital model, car buyers \u201cjust don\u2019t have a lot of options,\u201d Caltrider said. Cars scored worst for privacy among more than a dozen product categories \u2014 including fitness trackers, reproductive-health apps, smart speakers and other connected home appliances \u2014 that Mozilla has studied since 2017. Not one of the 25 car brands whose privacy notices were reviewed \u2014 chosen for their popularity in Europe and North America \u2014 met the minimum privacy standards of Mozilla, which promotes open-source, public interest technologies and maintains the Firefox browser. By contrast, 37% of the mental health apps the nonprofit reviewed this year did. Nineteen automakers say they can sell your personal data, their notices reveal. Half will share your information with government or law enforcement in response to a \u201crequest\u201d \u2014 as opposed to requiring a court order. Only two \u2014 Renault and Dacia, which are not sold in North America \u2014 offer drivers the option to have their data deleted. The automakers are vague on disclosing to whom they are selling what they collect, though the researchers have little doubt it includes data brokers, marketers and dealers. Partners with installed products and services, including SiriusXM, Google Maps and Onstar, are also amassing data. \u201cIncreasingly, most cars are wiretaps on wheels,\u201d said Albert Fox Cahn, a technology and human rights fellow at Harvard's Carr Center for Human Rights Policy. \u201cThe electronics that drivers pay more and more money to install are collecting more and more data on them and their passengers.\" \u201cThere is something uniquely invasive about transforming the privacy of one\u2019s car into a corporate surveillance space,\u201d he added. A trade group representing the makers of most cars and light trucks sold in the U.S., the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, took issue with that characterization. In a letter sent Tuesday to U.S. House and Senate leadership, it said it shares \u201cthe goal of protecting the privacy of consumers.\u201d It called for a federal privacy law, saying a \u201cpatchwork of state privacy laws creates confusion among consumers about their privacy rights and makes compliance unnecessarily difficult.\u201d The absence of such a law lets connected devices and smartphones amass data for tailored ad targeting and other marketing \u2014 while also raising the odds of massive information theft through cybersecurity breaches. The Associated Press asked the Alliance, which has resisted efforts to provide car owners and independent repair shops with access to onboard data, if it supports allowing car buyers to automatically opt out of data collection \u2014 and granting them the option of having collected data deleted. Spokesman Brian Weiss said that for safety reasons the group \u201chas concerns\u201d about letting customers completely opt out \u2014 but does endorse giving them greater control over how the data is used in marketing and by third parties. In a 2020 Pew Research survey, 52% of Americans said they had opted against using a product or service because they were worried about the amount of personal information it would collect about them. On security, Mozilla's minimum standards include encrypting all personal information on a car. The researchers said most car brands ignored their emailed questions on the matter, those that did offering partial, unsatisfactory responses. Japan-based Nissan astounded researchers with the level of honesty and detailed breakdowns of data collection its privacy notice provides, a stark contrast with Big Tech companies such as Facebook or Google. \u201cSensitive personal information\u201d collected includes driver's license numbers, immigration status, race, sexual orientation and health diagnoses. Further, Nissan says it can share \u201cinferences\u201d drawn from the data to create profiles \"reflecting the consumer\u2019s preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes.\u201d It was among six car companies that said they could collect \u201cgenetic information\u201d or \u201cgenetic characteristics,\" the researchers found. Nissan also said it collected information on \u201csexual activity.\" It didn't explain how. The all-electric Tesla brand scored high on Mozilla\u2019s \u201ccreepiness\u201d index. If an owner opts out of data collection, Tesla\u2019s privacy notice says the company may not be able to notify drivers \u201cin real time\u201d of issues that could result in \u201creduced functionality, serious damage, or inoperability.\u201d", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 21:30:00", "image_url": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/helenair.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/f9/0f91ef67-6f5b-530e-bcd1-66d8e5747df1/64fa828a2e68e.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200", "source_id": "helenair", "source_priority": 36771, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "7041a60f92969f0cee44600f7994cfc6", "title": "Apple Insider Exposes Massive MacBook Pro Shock", "link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2023/09/09/apple-m3-imac-macbook-pro-macbook-air-october-launch-delay/", "keywords": ["Consumer Tech", "/consumer-tech", "Innovation", "/innovation", "Consumer Tech", "/consumer-tech", "technology", "mobile", "standard"], "creator": ["Ewan Spence", " Senior Contributor"], "video_url": null, "description": "When will we see Apple's next MacBook Pro?", "content": "Forbes Innovation Consumer Tech Apple Insider Exposes Massive MacBook Pro Shock Ewan Spence Senior Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.

[+] (Photo by Phil Barker/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Future Publishing via Getty Images Writing on X , the social network formerly known as Twitter, noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo writes : \u201cit seems that Apple will not launch new MacBook models (equipped with M3 series processors) before the end of this year.\" This will come as a shock to many. Apple\u2019s M3 platform is widely expected to be the first Mac chipset built using 3nm technology instead of the current 5nm. This should offer improved battery life and reduced operating temperatures. The next generation of Apple Silicon is currently being tested and spotted in third-party developer logs and online benchmarking tools, alongside details on the M3 laptops working through the sloppy chain. Those laptops, the popular 13-inch MacBook Air and the kooky consumer-focused 13-inch MacBook Pro , were expected to debut the M3 chipset at a launch event in mid- to late-October, potentially alongside a similarly upgraded iMac. It\u2019s worth noting that Kuo only talks about the MacBook, rather than the desk-bound iMac, which leads to an interesting possibility. In previous launches, Apple Silicon has debuted on the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Both of these are popular machines which will be in high demand when they go on sale.

Also found: 68% of those who haven\u2019t tried generative AI are Gen X or boomers. \u201cThere\u2019s a generative AI divide,\u201d says Salesforce senior director of product marketing Kelly Eliyahu. \u201c49% of the population has used it, and 51% has never used it.\u201d Generative AI has been around for a long time, with generative models dating back as far as 1972 , according to Intel AI expert Ilke Demir. But it has burst onto the popular consciousness with the emergence of OpenAI with ChatGPT and visual creations from technologies like Creative Diffusion, MidJourney, and Adobe Firefly. Apparently, more for some people than others. For those who use the new technology, a third use it every day, Eliyahu says, while the rest use it weekly or more. Most are looking to automate work tasks, while about a third use it for fun, and a third use generative AI for learning about topics that interest them. The generative AI divide is largely a generational divide. Non-believers tend to be older and more cautious around new technology. 68% of non-users are Gen X or baby boomers, and almost nine out of 10 non-users don\u2019t see how generative AI will impact their life, and 40% says they aren\u2019t familiar with the technology. That\u2019s unfortunate, because that means that the oldest people in the population\u2014who are most vulnerable to non-online shopping scams\u2014don\u2019t understand existing uses of deepfakes created with generative AI for financial and political scams. Another third of non-users say the technology is not useful for them Those who use generative AI, however, see plenty of benefits: 46%: saves time 42%: easy to use 37%: fun to use 35%: teaches new things 32%: helps with complex concepts 29%: help make decisions quicker 28%: helps make more informed decisions 28%: keeps me more organized 26%: provides inspiration 22%: helps me succeed at work MORE FOR YOU Prompt Engineering Embraces Tree-Of-Thoughts As Latest New Technique To Solve Generative AI Toughest Problems The Amazing Ways Coca Cola Uses Generative AI In Art And Advertising More Back-To-Office Mandates, AI \u2018Agents\u2019 And WeWork\u2019s Future According to the survey, people would use generative AI more if it was more secure and safe, if they understood it better and knew more about how to use it, and if it was integrated into the technology they already use.

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max render based on multiple leaks Technizo Concept Leaks have exposed almost every detail of Apple\u2019s imminent iPhone 15 launch, but with just days to go, new secrets have been revealed. In a comprehensive report , Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman has detailed the size, weight, design changes, battery life and camera capabilities of various iPhone 15 models. Let\u2019s break them down. Size - Gurman claims that the iPhone 15 Pros\u2019 new titanium chassis will result in a 10% weight reduction. While this doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, it means the iPhone 15 Pro could weigh just 185g, down from 206g, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max would clock in at 216g, down from 240g. Having the iPhone 15 Pro Max weigh little more than the iPhone 14 Pro is a massive difference. Design \u2014 Gurman also reveals that the Pro\u2019s titanium chassis will have a brushed finish to reduce fingerprints, and smooth, rounded corners replace the hard edges of their predecessors. The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max displays also look noticeably larger due to a one-third reduction in their bezel sizes. All iPhone 15 models will have a more repairable design, with Apple recently backing California\u2019s right-to-repair bill. Render of Apple's iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro designs and color options based on leaks @theapplehub Battery Life & Charging - While not providing numbers, Gurman claims the iPhone 15 Pros\u2019 A17 Bionic chip will deliver more battery life than the 23-29 hours offered by the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max, respectively. Wireless charging will also be faster for all iPhone 15 models.

The U2 will have improved location tracking (to help it find what it\u2019s looking for? Sorry, couldn\u2019t resist ).

Industry observers claim the switch is now expected to occur with the iPhone 16 lineup in 2024. Cameras - For the first time, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will have telephoto (zoom) and ultra-wide cameras with more than 12 megapixels. However, Gurman doesn\u2019t provide a number. The Pro Max\u2019s exclusive periscopic zoom lens will deliver up to 6x optical zoom. Periscope lenses use a mirror so the lenses can be mounted sideways inside the phone to reduce the ...

While the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will have more RAM, something recently confirmed by TrendForce . At this point, we know almost everything about the iPhone 15 lineup, including Apple\u2019s higher prices for Pro models . Perhaps the only question left is whether the troubled iPhone 15 Pro Max will be released at the same time as the rest of the range or fall victim to widely expected delays .

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin iPhone 15 Pro Max renders based on multiple leaks @HansTSaiz The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will cost more than any previous iPhone, and we know the reasons why . But now, a new leak has made these increases harder to justify. A new report from research firm TrendForce has revealed that neither of the iPhone 15 Pro models will receive the storage upgrades widely anticipated. This means Apple will again release the Pros with 128GB of base storage, despite almost all rivals giving their flagships 256GB. Instead, Apple will offer 256GB, 512GB and 1TB storage as upgrade options. This is a hugely risky decision. With the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max expected to start at $1,099 and $1,199, respectively, this means prices for 1TB models could be as high as $1,600 for the Pro and $1,700 for the Pro Max. This will be a blow to iPhone fans after leaks suggested that the Pros\u2019 $100 price increase could be evened out by more generous storage capacities. Moreover, component cost differences between 128GB and 256GB are negligible these days, and the iPhone 15 Pros are expected to ship with 8K video recording, a mode that can eat up to 600MB per minute.

That\u2019s up from the 6GB in the iPhone 14 Pro models, but memory management was never in question with those phones, so I suspect most users would\u2019ve preferred to see that expenditure go towards more generous storage tiers. On the flip side, the iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max will get significantly more upgrades than standard iPhone 15 models. While the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are essentially iPhone 14 Pros at a lower price (A16 chip, Dynamic Island design, 48MP camera), the Pro models have titanium chassis, record-breaking bezels , Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports and a 3nm A17 chip. The iPhone 15 Pro Max will also exclusively get Apple\u2019s first 10x optical zoom camera , which is expected to be the biggest selling point in the range. That said, availability of the Pro Max is understood to be extremely limited at launch, with reports claiming it may be delayed by up to a month .

Register Here The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI has presented new challenges for security teams everywhere. In creating new ways for data to be accessed, gen AI doesn\u2019t fit traditional security paradigms focused on preventing data from going to people who aren\u2019t supposed to have it. To enable organizations to move quickly on gen AI without introducing undue risk, security providers need to update their programs, taking into account the new types of risk and how they put pressure on their existing programs. An entire industry is currently being built and expanded on top of LLMs hosted by such services as OpenAI, Hugging Face and Anthropic. In addition, there are a number of open models available such as LLaMA from Meta and GPT-2 from OpenAI. Access to these models could help employees in an organization solve business challenges. But for a variety of reasons, not everybody is in a position to access these models directly. Instead, employees often look for tools \u2014 such as browser extensions, SaaS productivity applications, Slack apps and paid APIs \u2014 that promise easy use of the models. VB Transform 2023 On-Demand Did you miss a session from VB Transform 2023? Register to access the on-demand library for all of our featured sessions. These intermediaries are quickly becoming a new source of shadow IT. Using a Chrome extension to write a better sales email doesn\u2019t feel like using a vendor; it feels like a productivity hack. It\u2019s not obvious to many employees that they are introducing a leak of important sensitive data by sharing all of this with a third party, even if your organization is comfortable with the underlying models and providers themselves. This type of risk is relatively new to most organizations. Three potential boundaries play into this risk: In each of these cases, the issue is understanding what data is going into a model. Only the individuals with access to the training, or fine-tuning, data should have access to the resulting model. As an example, let\u2019s say that an organization uses a product that fine-tunes an LLM using the contents of its productivity suite. How would that tool ensure that I can\u2019t use the model to retrieve information originally sourced from documents I don\u2019t have permission to access? In addition, how would it update that mechanism after the access I originally had was revoked? These are tractable problems, but they require special consideration. While privacy considerations aren\u2019t new, using gen AI with personal information can make these issues especially challenging. In many jurisdictions, automated processing of personal information in order to analyze or predict certain aspects of that person is a regulated activity. Using AI tools can add nuance to these processes and make it more difficult to comply with requirements like offering opt-out. Another consideration is how training or fine-tuning models on personal information might affect your ability to honor deletion requests, restrictions on repurposing of data, data residency and other challenging privacy and regulatory requirements. Vendor security, enterprise security and product security are particularly stretched by the new types of risk introduced by gen AI. Each of these programs needs to adapt to manage risk effectively going forward. Here\u2019s how. The starting point for vendor security when it comes to gen AI tools is to treat these tools like the tools you adopt from any other vendor. Ensure that they meet your usual requirements for security and privacy . Your goal is to ensure that they will be a trustworthy steward of your data. Given the novelty of these tools, many of your vendors may be using them in ways that aren\u2019t the most responsible. As such, you should add considerations into your due diligence process. You might consider adding questions to your standard questionnaire, for example: Your due diligence may take another form, and I\u2019m sure many standard compliance frameworks like SOC 2 and ISO 27001 will be building relevant controls into future versions of their frameworks. Now is the right time to start considering these questions and ensuring that your vendors consider them too. Each organization has its own approach to the balance between friction and usability. Your organization may have already implemented strict controls around browser extensions and OAuth applications in your SaaS environment. Now is a great time to take another look at your approach to make sure it still strikes the right balance. Untrusted intermediary applications often take the form of easy-to-install browser extensions or OAuth applications that connect to your existing SaaS applications. These are vectors that can be observed and controlled. The risk of employees using tools that send customer data to an unapproved third party is especially potent now that so many of these tools are offering impressive solutions using gen AI. In addition to technical controls, it\u2019s important to set expectations with your employees and assume good intentions. Ensure that your colleagues know what is appropriate and what is not when it comes to using these tools. Collaborate with your legal and privacy teams to develop a formal AI policy for employees. The biggest change to product security is ensuring that you aren\u2019t becoming an untrusted middleman for your customers. Make it clear in your product how you use customer data with gen AI. Transparency is the first and most powerful tool in building trust. Your product should also respect the same security boundaries your customers have come to expect. Don\u2019t let individuals access models trained on data they can\u2019t access directly. It\u2019s possible in the future there will be more mainstream technologies to apply fine-grained authorization policies to model access, but we\u2019re still very early in this sea change. Prompt engineering and prompt injection are fascinating new areas of offensive security, and you don\u2019t want your use of these models to become a source of security breaches. Give your customers options, allowing them to opt in or opt out of your gen AI features. This puts the tools in their hands to choose how they want their data to be used. At the end of the day, it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t stand in the way of progress. If these tools will make your company more successful, then avoiding them due to fear, uncertainty and doubt may be more of a risk than diving headlong into the conversation.

Apple Loop is here to remind you of a few of the very many discussions that have happened around Apple over the last seven days ( and you can read my weekly digest of Android news here on Forbes ). TIANJIN, CHINA - 2022/10/12: A customer is trying an iPhone 14 Pro Max in an Apple store. On ... [+] October 7, the iPhone 14 series were launched in the Chinese Mainland market. According to the latest report, Apple Inc. will cancel the plan to increase the production of 6 million iPhones 14 series because the demand is lower than expected. (Photo by Zhang Peng/LightRocket via Getty Images) LightRocket via Getty Images Update: September 9th: A Closer Look With The iPhone 15 Pro Max One final weekend ahead of the iPhone 15 launch and details on Apple\u2019s upgrades to the camera have leaked. While all four models will pick up new hardware - such as the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus moving to a 48-megapixel sensor, and new telephoto and ultrawide lenses for the iPhone 15 Pro - there is a significant upgrade for the top-end flagship. The iPhone 15 Pro Max is doubling the optical zoom: \"The iPhone 15 Pro models will continue to have three cameras, including a 48-megapixel sensor. There are new telephoto and ultrawide lenses with more megapixels than in last year\u2019s Pro sensors, and the company is planning to tout the enhancements as the premier additions in this year\u2019s phones.

This will double the iPhone\u2019s ability to zoom into images \u2014 with the physical lens itself, rather than software \u2014 from 3X magnification to around 6X.\" ( Bloomberg ). New Availability Issues Around iPhone 15, Delays Possible Apple\u2019s iPhone launch event takes place next week, and while the four smartphones in the iPhone 15 family will take to the stage, it may take longer than expected for customers to buy their new handsets. Because of various production issues, the number of handsets available is going to be lower than expected: \u201c[Apple analyst] Ming-Chi Kuo reveals that Apple is experiencing significant issues with producing camera sensors for standard iPhone 15 models and the titanium chassis of the Pros, plus delays in manufacturing the flagship iPhone 15 Pro Max. Perhaps the biggest shock is the new stacked CIS primary camera for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. Kuo states that Apple tried to resolve its production issues by increasing volume, but up to 15% of regular models are still affected.\" ( Forbes ). Not only are stocks going to be lower across the board, but the iPhone 15 Pro Max - which Apple expected to make up 30 to 40 percent of the combined iPhone 15 sales - is going t to be delayed by up to a month, leaving it until late October before going on wide retail sale: \u201cThe yield issues with Sony, the supplier of image sensors for the iPhone 15 Pro Max, are severe. As a result, the release date of the iPhone 15 Pro Max could be delayed by up to approximately 4 weeks.\u201d ( Forbes ). 14 Days To Go The delays aren\u2019t stopping Apple\u2019s marketing machine spooling up to get the attention of everyone outside of the usual geekerati circles. One of those is the now-tradition YouTube countdown clock to the moment the Apple Store doors open: \"It's another small step down the road that ends on Friday, September 22 with the release of the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra second generation. That\u2019s when they\u2019re all expected to land on Apple Store shelves. It also looks like new AirPods Pro will be revealed at the keynote and put on sale with the iPhones and Watches.\" ( Forbes ). \u2026and if you are looking for a comprehensive timeline for the launches, David Phelan has you covered ( Forbes ). Get Ready For A Price Rise Fans of the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are getting ready to pay a little more for their new iOS smartphones. The latest leaked price details suggest that there is going to be a significant mark-up on the handsets, with the new build materials and optical hardware shouldering much of the blame: \"In previous reports, titanium has been cited as a big cost increase for Apple, but with claims that the iPhone 15 Pro would not jump in price, it appeared this wouldn\u2019t be passed on to end users. Throw in the cost of Apple\u2019s first 10x optical zoom camera, and this aligns with claims that the iPhone 15 Pro Max could rise by as much as $200, becoming the most expensive iPhone ever released.\" ( Forbes ). Would Apple Risk Launching A Cheaper MacBook This week, a few signs were picked up from the supply chain suggesting that Apple is preparing a cheaper MacBook to take on the Chromebook. Scheduled for late next year, it would be a courageous choice for Apple to go below the recognised $999 mark: \"The most significant risk would be to Apple\u2019s brand. While there have been \u2018cheaper\u2019 products built around the value proposition launched in the past - the iPhone 5C immediately spins to mind - the lure of Apple is to be a part of the in-crowd, to buy into the dream of products that offer more than the norm, and to feel that your money is purchasing a quality product.\" ( Forbes ). Apple's European Gatekeepers Three of Apple\u2019s key properties have been marked as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d by the European Union. In essence, the App Store, the Safari browser, and iOS have a market strength that will attract more regulations to ensure they do not distort the competition. \"The EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) seeks to curtail the power of major tech companies. Designated \"gatekeeper\" platforms will now face prohibition against favoring their own services over those of rivals. These platforms will also be prevented from combining personal data across different services and will have to allow users the option to download apps from alternative platforms.\" ( MacRumors ). And Finally... Apple\u2019s stock has seen a notable fall this week following restrictions placed on Chinese government officials' use of iPhones. \"Investors are fretting over the ability of the world\u2019s most valuable public company to do business in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Apple notched its largest daily fall in over a month on Wednesday. The company lost about $200 billion in two days, and its stock is currently the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\" ( CNN ).

Made By Google Teaser Video It may be a month away, but Google is building up some PR momentum around the \u201cMade By Google\u201d event on October 4th. The Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Watch 2, and Pixel Buds Pro 2 all appeared in Google\u2019s teaser video released earlier this week. We didn\u2019t get a look at the software, but the design was on full show: \"As expected, one of the two leaked color schemes is prominent in the video. The leaked \u201c Porcelain\" color that first appeared on one of the Google Store\u2019s internal pages last week is very much on show. What we don\u2019t see is any software running on the Pixel 8\u2019s screen.\" ( Forbes ).

As well as the new colors, the temperature sensor, and the improved Tensor Mobile chipset, you have smaller details that will add to the value: \"The Pixel 8 Pro is also said to ship with a telephoto lens with a 5x zoom, though the features section does not specify if \u20185x\u2019 is lossless zoom or a combination of optical and digital zoom. Other additions such as NFC, mmWave antenna cover, and several microphones will find their way to the flagship.\" ( WCCFTech ). Update: September 9th: Pixel Watch 2 Specs Confirmed Part of Google\u2019s teaser video for the launch event saw a brief moment of the Pixel Watch 2, Google\u2019s second wearable under the Pixel brand. The company has now given the Watch pride of place in its own teaser video. Not only is the new digital crown on show, but the look at the rear panel shows an engraved IP68 rating alongside a raft of sensors: \u201c...the array of sensors seems to have been redesigned. While there could be any number of reasons for this, it adds credence to the suggestion that the Pixel Watch 2 will inherit the Fitbit Sense 2\u2019s continuous electrodermal activity sensor for measuring stress.\" ( Tom\u2019s Guide ). Folds, Z Folds, And Android Software Google\u2019s Pixel Fold may grab the attention, but Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold range is now in its fifth iteration. What software lessons can Samsung teach Google and, in turn, have them roll out across Android\u2019s large-screened devices? Mishaal Rahman suggests starting with multitasking: \"The Pixel Fold, in contrast, doesn\u2019t even have a search bar in its taskbar (yet), so it\u2019s awkward to select a second split-screen app when you initiate split-screen mode from the recents menu. Google\u2019s software does, at least, let you launch apps in split-screen mode from the home screen, unlike One UI. On the other hand, Google\u2019s software lacks arguably the best feature for split-screen multitasking: saving app pairs.\" ( Android Central ). An Ultra Camera For An Ultra Phone While the attention is on Google, details on Samsung\u2019s next flagship Galaxy handset have leaked. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is leaning heavily into the camera with some new technology expected: \"More notable is the claimed camera spec. The provision of a 200MP main sensor, a 12MP ultra-wide (presumably), and a 10MP telephoto is in keeping with the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, but this list appears to confirm previous claims that the S24 Ultra is set for a new 50MP 3x telephoto camera.\" ( Yogesh Brar via Trusted Reviews ). Honor Magic V2 Wins IFA Last week\u2019s IFA trade show in Berlin saw countless new consumer electronics previewed and launched. Naturally, there were some standouts, with Honor\u2019s second foldable smartphone picking up many \u201cbest in show\u201d awards. \"The Magic V2 offers larger displays inside and out than the obvious comparable models from Samsung and Google, but remains slimmer and lighter than both. It's also got a larger battery using cutting-edge silicon-carbon technology and upgraded camera sensors befitting a flagship phone. And if the current Honor Magic Vs is anything to go by, it'll be quite a bit cheaper than a Samsung or Google foldable in the markets where it's available.\" ( Tom\u2019s Guide ). Surface Duo Not Forgotten This week saw a surprising announcement from Microsoft. For all of the lack of action around the Android-powered Surface Duo, a new search function has been added to the folding dual-screened mobile device. Is it too little, too late, given the rise of foldable devices that have met and exceeded the promise of the Duo? \u201cAwesome new feature available for Surface Duo users - start a Bing Chat conversation from anywhere you find search on your Surface Duo or in Microsoft Launcher. \" ( Twitter ) Microsoft Surface Duo and Surface Duo 2. Ewan Spence Xiaomi Increases Android Support Another manufacturer has announced an increased support window for software. This week it is the turn of Xiaomi to push out to five years, extending the secure life of their latest smartphone: \"We are proud to announce a significant enhancement to our commitment to providing exceptional software support. Xiaomi 13T and Xiaomi 13T Pro will include 4 generations of Android OS upgrades, as well as 5 years of security patches.\" ( Xiaomi on Twitter ). And Finally... Google has refreshed the look and feel of the Android branding. The latest blog post goes into the design details for those wondering why small changes can have so much impact. \"With this update, you\u2019ll notice some subtle changes that help connect Android to Google. In addition to moving away from our longstanding lowercase stylization of \u201candroid,\u201d we\u2019re elevating the Android logo by capitalizing the \u201cA,\u201d adding more weight to its appearance when placed next to Google\u2019s logo.

AAPL is set to unveil its latest innovations , including the much-anticipated iPhone 15 series, at its \"Wonderlust\" event scheduled for September 12. What Happened: The event promises to showcase not just the new iPhone lineup but also updates to the Apple Watch and AirPods, along with upcoming software updates. At the forefront of the unveiling is the iPhone 15 Pro line, which is expected to be the star of the show. The tech giant is also gearing up to introduce advancements in iOS 17, iPadOS 17 and watchOS 10. The event is crucial as the iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods collectively constitute about 60% of Apple's total revenue, not accounting for the earnings from digital services such as Apple Music, Bloomberg reported . Among the notable changes that are expected to be revealed, Apple is transitioning the iPhone's charging and data port to the USB-C standard, enhancing its performance albeit potentially displeasing some consumers. The modification marks the second alteration to the iPhone's port since its inception, the previous one being in 2012. The iPhone 15 series will reportedly come in four different versions: the base models iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, and the more premium iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. The Pro versions, specifically, have undergone a design overhaul, adopting titanium sides instead of stainless steel, making them more resilient and lighter. Also Read: Apple's $3 Trillion Crown Slips As Disappointing Sales Take Toll Another significant enhancement is the incorporation of the Dynamic Island interface in the non-Pro models, a feature introduced in the iPhone 14 Pro models last year, according to Bloomberg. The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are reportedly upgrading to a 48-megapixel main camera sensor, aligning with the resolution of the previous year's iPhone 14 Pro's main camera. The Pro models will also retain a trio of cameras, boasting new telephoto and ultrawide lenses with increased megapixels. The iPhone 15 Pro Max, on the other hand, will have a revamped telephoto system that doubles the hardware zoom capabilities from 3X to approximately 6X magnification. On the Apple Watch front, the focus remains on enhancing performance, with significant strides made in processing speed facilitated by a new chip. The watches will also reportedly inherit the U2 ultrawide-band chip, promising improved \"Find My\" functionalities. As for the AirPods, the shift to USB-C charging aligns with the changes introduced in the iPhone series. While no substantial hardware alterations are expected, a software update promises features like improved automatic device switching and a Conversation Awareness feature that intuitively silences media when a conversation is initiated, according to Bloomberg.
