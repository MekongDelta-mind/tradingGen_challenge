But the report, titled \u201cBang for your buck: Which Utah schools have the best return on investment,\u201d also indicates much depends on what a student studies and the workforce demand for those credentials. The report, which examined return on investment at Utah\u2019s public and private colleges and universities, found Weber State University is tops for students\u2019 10-year net present value of their education. This was calculated by how much a certain sum of money \u2014 in this case, the future earnings of additional education minus the cost of that education \u2014 would be worth today. The report shows that the first-year returns of graduates of some Weber State University associate degree programs \u2014 computer science, industrial production technologies, nursing and allied health professions \u2014 outstrip the median bachelor\u2019s degree programs. Graduates of Weber State\u2019s manufacturing engineering technology associate degree program \u2014 its plastics and composites concentration, for one \u2014 experience first-year median returns of nearly $69,000, according to the report. The median return on investment for those who earn associate degrees in computer science from Weber State is $58,224 and $48,672 for nursing. Nursing students Kalley Jaques and Aisha Holts work on a central line change as students work in the simulation lab in the Marriott Health Building at Weber State University in Ogden on Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2023. Scott G Winterton, Deseret News \u201cBachelor\u2019s degrees in Utah are more likely to pay off in the longer run \u2014 though Weber State University defies this trend. The most common credential from Weber State University is an associate\u2019s degree, though they also offer certifications and bachelor\u2019s degrees,\u201d the report states. The university also offers a wide array of graduate degree programs, including a doctorate of nursing practice and a physician assistant program. Weber State University Provost Ravi Krovi said the report was welcome news to administrators and educators striving to offer programs that meet workforce needs and help graduates earn higher wages. \u201cWe were thrilled but we\u2019re not altogether surprised. It\u2019s sort of validating, quite honestly. We certainly want to tell our story but when you have data which comes in and proves it, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s even better,\u201d he said. Krovi said Weber State University has made \u201ca conscious attempt to really focus on cost from a tuition and fees perspective. Our tuition and fees have not gone up that much. If you go back to the last 10 years, it\u2019s less than the overall increase in the consumer price index.\u201d The university has made guided pathways a priority, too, he said. \u201cAs students come in, we try to give them a better perspective of what are the options and so I think it\u2019s one thing to give advice, but it\u2019s also important to have the right type of programming. Stackable programs really help us from that standpoint,\u201d he said. A student might come to Weber State with the goal of earning a certificate, which are short-term programs. Once they grow accustomed to the college experience, the hope is they will feel more comfortable and confident about seeking an associate degree or even a bachelor\u2019s degree, he said. \u201cThat transition and transfer is a lot more seamless because it\u2019s all our curriculum, our program. So I think that mission, the dual mission for us, is really helpful for students,\u201d Krovi said. Nursing student Whitney Weston works out a few mathematical problems as she and other students go about their work in the simulation lab in the Marriott Health Building at Weber State University in Ogden on Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2023. Scott G Winterton, Deseret News The report also notes Salt Lake Community College\u2019s large variety of associate degrees. Its computer and information sciences program, for example, \u201chas a first-year return on investment of a whopping $53,628,\u201d the report states. Associate degrees with the highest median earnings include engineering and architecture. Median earnings are also higher than average for public safety, nursing, construction and manufacturing, business and agriculture degrees, according to the report. The report also found that the private, for-profit Neumont College of Computer Science had the highest ranked 40-year net present value of any college in Utah, followed by Brigham Young University, the University of Utah, Weber State and Westminster University. The report explores the financial return on investment for education beyond high school \u2014 or whether pursuing certificates, certification, associate degrees and bachelor\u2019s degrees make financial sense. \u201cResearch suggests that the return on investment for education beyond high school is generally worth the time and effort,\u201d the report states. But degree selection and workforce and industry needs can make a difference. According to the report, more than a quarter of those with associate degrees earn more than the median bachelor\u2019s degree wage and 35% of those with bachelor\u2019s degrees earn more than the median master\u2019s degree wage.

(Sep)NOTE: Previews are listed in day orderNORWEGIAN CPI (MON): The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced.UK UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES (TUE): Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end.UK GDP ESTIMATE (WED): A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought.US CPI (WED): Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern.ECB ANNOUNCEMENT (THU): 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%.AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYMENT (THU): participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms.SWEDISH CPIF (THU): July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak.US RETAIL SALES (THU): Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July. While the data set will offer a glimpse on the health of the consumer amid concerns that the economy may slow significantly in the months ahead, traders will also be watching the University of Michigan's prelim survey release due Friday, where the rise in energy prices is likely to have weighed on sentiment.CHINESE ACTIVITY DATA (FRI): Retail sales Y/Y in August are expected to rise by 2.8% (prev. 2.5%), whilst there is currently no consensus for Industrial Production metrics. The data will be closely watched to diagnose the health of the world\u2019s second-larger economy and to gauge the drip-feed of stimulus seen over recent weeks. Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d.This article originally appeared on Newsquawk This article was written by Newsquawk Analysis at www.forexlive.com.", "content": ": The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August.

One new change comes on the heels of the release of Haunted Mansion , the latest film to be based on the beloved attraction. The film's villain was the Hatbox Ghost (Jared Leto), the animatronic character who originally appeared in Disneyland's Haunted Mansion ride before being removed shortly after the ride debuted in 1969. However, the Hatbox Ghost was brought back to Anaheim in 2015, and now he's finally coming to the Magic Kingdom in Orlando. It was announced during Destination 23 that the Hatbox Ghost is coming to the Haunted Mansion attraction in Florida in late November. Disney Imagineer Daniel Joseph joined Experiences and Products Chairman Josh D'Amaro on stage for the announcement earlier today. Joseph revealed the Hatbox Ghost will be materializing in the Haunted Mansion as you pass the attraction's Endless Hallway. In the original ride, the ghost appeared holding a hatbox, and the goal was for his head to materialize inside the hatbox. However, the limitations of effects in the late '60s never allowed it to be pulled off properly. In the years since the figure's removal, he earned a mythical reputation among Disney enthusiasts, only for the character to make his official return with modern upgrades in 2015. Haunted Mansion Director on Jared Leto's Hatbox Ghost: \"It's very surprising. You'd be shocked to know who it was until you're told,\" Justin Simien revealed to Entertainment Weekly . \"The character itself, it's part digital, part physical performance. We're trying to go for something scary that feels like it could exist physically in the real world, on the ride, but pushes the scare a lot further than the ride does. He knocked it out of the park. He's very menacing and terrifying.\" In Haunted Mansion , a doctor (Rosario Dawson) and her 9-year-old son (Chase Dillon), looking to start a new life, move into a strangely affordable mansion in New Orleans , only to discover that the place is much more than they bargained for. Desperate for help, they contact a priest (Owen Wilson), who, in turn, enlists the aid of a widowed scientist-turned failed-paranormal expert (LaKeith Stanfield), a French Quarter psychic (Tiffany Haddish), and a crotchety historian (Danny DeVito).

Brian Ward, CEO of Savvy Games Group , has taken the lead in helping Saudi Arabia\u2019s attempt to move beyond its reputation for human rights abuses and being an oil nation to being a visionary technology leader bankrolling the game industry. This tension between the past and the future is ever-present in Saudi Arabia, where companies like Savvy Games Group \u2014 owned by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia \u2014 are trying to change perceptions through games while remaining cognizant of the kingdom\u2019s appetite for measured change. Ward believes people have to see the change happening in society on the ground in Saudi Arabia in order to understand how quickly things can happen under the new regime that is mostly supportive of the game industry. There is perhaps no other country where the clash between tradition and modernity \u2014 something my world history professor talked about so long ago \u2014 is so stark. The change and the deals have been happening at a dizzying rate. It\u2019s like a big game of Monopoly, and the playing board of the game industry is set up on a global scale. Savvy Games Group acquired Los Angeles-based mobile game publisher Scopely for $4.9 billion in April, and it bought a $1 billion stake in Sweden-based game publisher Embracer Group. It also acquired ESL Gaming and FaceIt in esports to create ESL FaceIt Group. And the Saudis have also bought stakes in Capcom, Nexon and Nintendo this year, building on stakes it acquired previously in Activision Blizzard, Take-Two Interactive and Electronic Arts. That has made the gaming world take notice. Savvy\u2019s big stakeholder, the Public Investment Fund (run by the Saudi Arabian government) is flush with cash from the oil boom and it has set aside $37.8 billion to build up Saudi Arabia\u2019s presence in the global games industry \u2013 with $13.3 billion of that earmarked for acquiring a major publisher. That\u2019s more money than anyone around the world is earmarking for gaming investments and acquisitions. It\u2019s a sign that the government is serious about weaning the country from oil. The Saudi Vision 2030 is a government program launched by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to diversify economically, socially and culturally, in line with the vision of bin Salman. The Saudis announced it in 2016, but the country remained about 74% dependent on oil exports as of 2021. The country understands that the oil economy could dry up in the next 27 years, and it has to have other jobs ready \u2014 and they are trickling in so far. For the games industry, this influx of Saudi money into games is not without controversy, as the Saudi funding is controversial and the company has only been at it since November 2021. Critics say that the regime of Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud doesn\u2019t respect human rights. As crown prince and prime minister, he was connected to the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 via alleged killers who had ties to the crown prince. Accepting funding from the Saudis under such a regime represents a moral quandary, as the Saudis have become a big source of funding in their efforts to diversify beyond their dependence on oil, which the world is in the process of moving away from in pursuit of clean energy. Saudi defenders say that all major sources of money in the world are tainted in some way, and accepting money from the Saudis does not mean you have to accept interference from the Saudis or embrace their agenda. Ward pointed out in an interview with GamesBeat that the country is undergoing change when it comes to women\u2019s rights and other freedoms, and it is serious about creating transformative results when it comes to diversity and new jobs associated with game studios. Still, given the fact that being gay is illegal in Saudi Arabia, The Last of Us Part 2 was banned in the country for having gay women in its leading roles. Ward has said the company aims to become a great games company and is not tied to a specific political agenda and he is not there for an \u201cimage makeover project.\u201d While change may be happening, it\u2019s not happening fast enough for critics. I caught up with Ward in an interview at the company\u2019s booth at the Gamescom expo in Cologne, Germany. Here\u2019s an edited transcript of our interview. Brian Ward: Sorry I wasn\u2019t able to meet before. GamesBeat: You guys were busy buying somebody. Brian Ward: That was a hectic time. GamesBeat: How are things going since then? Especially with acquiring Scopely. Ward: Very good. We\u2019re obviously delighted to have closed the transaction with Scopely. Their Monopoly Go product is fantastic. It\u2019s doing very well. The people are working super hard on integration. They\u2019ve been a pleasure to work with in that regard. So far we\u2019re delighted. GamesBeat: On things like esports, I wonder how much focus you have on MENA (Middle East/North Africa) versus the wider world. Ward: We\u2019re pretty globally focused. The live attendance on all the majors this year has been up. The viewership, the hours watched have been up. There have been some hiccups in the sector generally with publisher spend on esports this year, but overall the business has been doing great. We\u2019re focused on MENA, of course. The EFG folks are in the middle of executing on Gamers8. There are plans for that tournament to be bigger and more robust next year. There\u2019s a lot going on. The conference next week will be a good one. GamesBeat: Is that a first for them, or have they been doing them before? Ward: This is the second version of Next World Forum. Gamers8 started during COVID as Gamers Without Borders, for charity relief. This is the second version of both the G8 and the NWF. GamesBeat: Is there a feeling of progress as you come out of COVID? Esports had to take some huge hits during that time. It transformed a lot as well. Ward: I think we\u2019re beyond COVID. The capital markets, the economic situation last year and coming into this year, caused some publishers to pull back on their esports spend, which affected a couple of pieces of the business, but overall attendance is up. Viewership is up. There seems to be as much engagement as there was before from a fan point of view. GamesBeat: For Saudi gamers and Saudi esports fans, how would you describe the market? Ward: When we invested in EFG, it seemed that coming out of COVID \u2013 that was nearly two years ago now \u2013 it was an inflection point where engagement had changed or accelerated because of COVID, and there would be some consolidation in esports. There would be some dynamics that would sort themselves out, whether it\u2019s the relationship between players and teams and publishers and where the power base really sits. A lot of that still has to get sorted out. Team economics are not universally great. GamesBeat: The game industry itself, where do you see the trends developing? Ward: We\u2019re super excited, especially on the heels of closing Scopely. We\u2019re excited about mobile-first cross-platform opportunities. Scopely is also making great progress in direct payments. That\u2019s an interesting economic lever for us. For Savvy, we now have a great anchor in mobile. We\u2019re looking forward to figuring out how we can facilitate, like we\u2019re doing with Scopely, some partners in PC and console. GamesBeat: You\u2019re still looking around for opportunities? Ward: This year we haven\u2019t been looking at as many opportunities. We\u2019ve been focused internally on making sure we have the right leadership team in place. Scopely is a big acquisition. The integration is fairly involved. We\u2019re focused on making sure that we\u2019re putting some investment professionals in place, so we don\u2019t rely on external advisors as much. We\u2019re focused internally on our structure and governance and operating model, more so than looking for additional investments. GamesBeat: Were there some things that made you think that the period in which you were buying assets there \u2013 was that fortuitous in some ways? When there are downturns in the economy, prices for acquisitions are lower. It\u2019s a good time to buy. Did that matter to you? If you have strategic imperatives to move into a business fast, you probably don\u2019t care as much about the economic situation. Ward: That\u2019s true. It\u2019s very difficult to time the market. It\u2019s been fortuitous that valuations have come off a bit and those people with capital to employ have been in a market where it\u2019s been more difficult for people to find as many varied sources of capital as there were two years ago. That\u2019s advantageous to us. But we haven\u2019t pulled on that lever very hard. This year we\u2019ve been focused more internally. GamesBeat: For games it seems like there was a lot of pressure on valuations, after some very big excitement in 2021. Everybody thought that usage was going to go up forever. Is there a level-setting that you see that still reflects favorable trends? Ward: Overall, I think the trends are super favorable for the long term. We don\u2019t get too excited about this year versus last year or 2022 versus COVID. Long term we think this is probably the best entertainment business to be in. Yes, there\u2019s some sort of reconciliation. Figuring out where usage and engagement will land after COVID. But that will settle. GamesBeat: I listened to Take-Two\u2019s earnings call. It was interesting to hear Strauss Zelnick answer a question about games and Hollywood, all the synergy happening right now. Someone asked why they aren\u2019t doing more of that. He said, \u201cWe came from movies. It was a very hard business. There were many failures.\u201d For years everyone saw that the big opportunity was in games, so why would they go back in a big way? Although he did say that they\u2019re working on a Borderlands movie and some other projects. They\u2019re participating in that. But he felt like it was a no-brainer that gaming is still the more interesting business. Ward: It\u2019s kind of the flip side of the trend from 20 years ago, where movies became games. Now it\u2019s games becoming movies. GamesBeat: Do you think about that as an opportunity as well? Ward: Not yet. We\u2019re not focused on that at the moment. I still view us as a startup. We have maybe a couple hundred people in Saudi Arabia and 4,000 worldwide. We still have a lot of things to do in terms of building a games business. We have a pretty good esports business. GamesBeat: Are you focused on building a larger local staff? Ward: Very much so. The studio, which is now renamed Steer Studios, has done a super job. They now have about 80 people on two or three mobile teams, and 80% of them are Saudis. We\u2019re highly focused and highly incentivized against building out the local ecosystem. GamesBeat: How does that mix in with the Scopely business? Is it alongside Scopely? Ward: Scopely is very interested in the MENA region and expanding beyond their traditional markets. We expect that they\u2019ll be looking at opportunities in MENA and Saudi specifically. GamesBeat: How do you look back after some years on the issues around human rights that people have had with Saudi Arabia, whether or not they want to do business there? How is that turning out? Ward: My standard answer to this, or part of my standard answer, is for folks to take the time to understand what\u2019s going on there and how far this social transformation and economic diversification project is coming in the last five years. A tremendous amount of progress has been made toward Vision 2030 and all of this transformation. It\u2019s exciting. We\u2019re super happy to be part of it, part of this long-term journey. GamesBeat: Is there some sense of mission attached to that connected to Savvy? Ward: This is what really attracted me to this position and got me to move to Riyadh. I understood a bit about Vision 2030 and the economic diversification, social transformation aspect. But once I saw, once I visited for the first time and saw what that meant on the ground, I could see that this is kind of like China 35 years ago. The pace of change is astonishing. It seemed to be a unique opportunity to take part in something worthwhile. That\u2019s why I went there, and I think a lot of the people we\u2019ve hired and who have moved there are inspired by the same opportunity. GamesBeat: The flow of money into games, do you have any general observations about that? Is there some history to that flow? I just remember that when I joined VentureBeat 15 years ago, I thought I would stop covering games. There was a focus on venture capital for (tech), and there was (virtually) no venture capital for games. I thought I\u2019d end up covering tech more than games. But here we are 15 years later and GamesBeat is very big. Ward: You would know far more about this, but the level of engagement and the fan base and reach now of games, for those of us who\u2019ve been doing this almost 30 years \u2013 I remember thinking, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if we were eventually bigger than the music industry?\u201d Now we\u2019re bigger than those guys and the movies and somebody else put together. When you think about 3.2 billion people on the planet playing games on a regular basis, it\u2019s astonishing. GamesBeat: Saudi Arabia is also into building new cities and new structures. Do you have some sort of dream for that? How would building cities with games in mind happen? Ward: As you know, Vision 2030 encompasses all of those things. The giga-projects at NEOM and Qiddiya, which have significant \u2013 I mean, Qiddiya is essentially an entertainment-based city being built just west of Riyadh. We have a big part to play in the game section of that city. NEOM has a big games component to it as well. All these things are tied together under not only Vision 2030, but the national strategy for games and esports. Saudi, to my knowledge, is the only country on the planet that\u2019s announced a national strategy backed by the government for our sector. All of these things are interconnected in some pretty major ways. GamesBeat: The one hiccup that we\u2019ve seen lately is whether or not you were going to do the investment in Embracer. I don\u2019t know how you would signal to the rest of the market what that means. That particular deal is one that maybe wasn\u2019t going to happen. Is there any change in strategy? Ward: We don\u2019t have a change in our strategy. Our strategy has been consistent for the last two years. When we made our initial significant investment in Embracer, we had great faith in the leadership and the long-term strategic vision for Embracer. That hasn\u2019t changed either. We\u2019re very happy with our investment in Embracer over the long term. GamesBeat: The interest in doing large deals, is that still part of what you want? Ward: I think Scopely is the sixth-largest M&A deal in our industry\u2019s history. We\u2019re still interested, and we\u2019ve deployed maybe 25% of the capital designed to be allocated to us over the long term. We still have a significant part of our mandate to fulfill. GamesBeat: Do you have an interest in making sure you\u2019re not perceived as investing at valuations that are too high, or throwing too much money at your targets? Ward: We employ a lot of excellent and well-paid advisors to give us good opinions on these things. We trust the advice they give us. We think we\u2019ve done deals that have been very beneficial to Saudi and fair to both parties. If we looked at the transaction value on Scopely today we\u2019d be very pleased with how that\u2019s working out, given our mission. It\u2019s long term. People probably thought Amazon paying a billion dollars for Twitch was crazy at the time. GamesBeat: The good old days, when prices were low. For women in Saudi Arabia, do you feel like there are real opportunities for change for them? Ward: This is the thing that surprised me. I didn\u2019t have any personal knowledge or experience of the region. To see firsthand what was going on there in relation to opportunities for women, just generally speaking, was a real eye-opener. In a studio, which has nearly 80 people so far \u2013 this is a development studio. Almost 30% of that workforce are women. At any studio anywhere in the world that would be a pretty remarkable number. There\u2019s an equally high percentage of women in the Saudi workforce generally. It\u2019s exciting. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019m really happy about. When the Scopely guys came to visit, around the time of the closing, or just prior to the closing, we had a lunch for Scopely leadership and all of the local women employees in Saudi. The Scopely folks said they were blown away by the level of energy, enthusiasm, knowledge, and professionalism in that group. One of them said he wished he could bottle up that energy and take it back to California. GamesBeat: U.S. money has been going all over the world for decades. I suppose you could put an interpretation on that money. When China was also in the position of being able to finance a lot of the world, I think people wondered if they have a philosophy that also gets exported along with those investments in all those companies. Do they run these companies in a Chinese way? What is your own view as far as the next entity that really has the opportunity to invest all over the world? Is there a philosophy you\u2019d like to export, but also maybe one that stays at home in Saudi Arabia as well? Ward: There isn\u2019t a philosophy, other than we\u2019ve always intended to be and have been consistent in communicating this \u2013 we\u2019ve been given carte blanche to operate like a true games company, consistent with the values of our industry, what people consider to be important. That\u2019s been true. That was one thing I was pretty alive to when I first thought about the opportunity, because to your point, Chinese companies tend to operate \u2013 not all of them, but they tend to operate in a Chinese way. Western companies operate in a western way. But I can\u2019t say there\u2019s any defining set of values around being a Saudi games company. We\u2019re just trying to be a games company, period. GamesBeat: One interesting data point, maybe, that I was thinking about now. I wrote a profile on this guy named Amir Satvat who works for Amazon. He\u2019s kind of a quant. During the big layoffs that started happening in the fall, he started scraping all the game industry sites for job openings. He aggregated them into a spreadsheet on LinkedIn and made it available for everyone to look at. Here\u2019s all the jobs. He came up with 732 companies and 14,000 jobs that are open. The fun part was that he\u2019s noticed that for the last six weeks or so, that number has been steady. He sees that as a stabilization happening over a relatively short amount of time. Before that openings were tending to go down. Does that mean anything to you, that the collective number of jobs in the game industry is starting to go back up? Ward: I\u2019m not an expert by any stretch. I would anticipate that most of the post-COVID reconciliation of how many users there are, the engagement level and so forth has sorted itself out in terms of how many people we need to meet demand. We should start to be back to business as usual. That\u2019s what I would expect. GamesBeat: There\u2019s AI as well. Nobody knows what that\u2019s going to mean. I talked to a professor a few weeks ago who was saying that we could have a 10% boost to world GDP by 2032 with all the AI advances happening now. That\u2019s $11 trillion. That\u2019s happening. He thinks there\u2019s going to be more change in the next 10 years from AI than in the last 150 years of industrial revolution. One of his guys looked at a typical 2,000-person enterprise and found that jobs in that enterprise would probably be done with one-third to two-thirds fewer people. All these things seem to suggest we\u2019re about to be in another time of change. We thought there was change already in the last few decades, but there\u2019s more coming. Ward: But isn\u2019t that one of the best things about our industry, the constant change and development and evolution of it? I think AI is going to add a lot of jobs. There will be shifting in who does what. Did we need less artists when SpeedTree was introduced? No, we needed more. More tools mean more stuff gets done. That\u2019s the way I view it.

In the early 2000s, selling two games at once became something of a trend. Blame it on , whose and sold approximately a bajillion copies. The only difference between the and versions was which you got, and the mandate to \u201ccatch \u2018em all\u201d made grabbing both irresistible. It was also a period of technological shift, as the second generation of 3D consoles became the unquestioned top dogs. But Pok\u00e9mon had shown that the consoles no longer had to operate alone. Games like had shown that big consoles like the N64 could operate in cohesion with their handheld siblings. But while some franchises had moved naturally into 3D, others struggled. Metroid had missed the N64 entirely, with the console coming and going without an entry. The game\u2019s shape-shifting exploration felt like it belonged to the 2D era. Plus, the fact that any developer would invite direct comparisons to an undisputed classic like made any potential game a tough mountain to climb. But climb a developer did, and suddenly in 2002 there were not one but two new Metroid games. There was the showstopper, the GameCube\u2019s . But there was also the side project, the second part of the one-two punch, the GameBoy Advance\u2019s , which is available right now if you\u2019ve subscribed to . Nintendo R&D1 didn\u2019t want to simply pay homage to . Samus\u2019s suit is visibly different from her iconic brown and yellow look, a difference that will matter in the game. After her adventures deep within the bowels of SR388 in , the planet\u2019s surface apparently offered up another nasty surprise for Samus: X parasites, macro-amoeba floating energy suckers. They almost kill Samus, if not for a vaccine made from cells of the infant Metroid that she had \u201cadopted\u201d in the 1994 game. The result is a new Samus, more Metroid than ever. The X parasites no longer affect her, and in fact can even help her, but she has new weaknesses, like the cold. Her suit, fused with both the baby Metroid and the X parasites, has turned bright blue. is a much more directed experience than , with a helpful map guiding the way. Perhaps more than any other gameplay mechanic, \u2019s biggest addition to the world of Metroid might be Navigation Centers, rooms in which Samus is very clearly told what to do and where to go. She\u2019s in a space station with only a computer for company, she names it Adam after a commander who respected her. Samus and Adam aren\u2019t exactly friendly, but there\u2019s a level of respect between them that feels earned. Samus notes in a cutscene that the real-life Adam was one of the few Space Marines who didn\u2019t see her gender as a joke. Taking orders from a computer, especially one as blunt as this one, chafes at her. But amidst her frustration, she\u2019d rather be taken seriously than as a joke. It would be too much to say that asks what it means to be a woman in the workplace, but the game offers some fascinating ideas even if it doesn\u2019t develop them fully. The parasites can give life just as they take it away, and are constantly seen flying around the space station rebuilding enemies that Samus has just turned into goo. To battle the endless enemies, Samus has her blaster, of course, and missiles. Missiles are crucial, with the ability to knock out tougher enemies and break up gross blockages. As the game moves forward, unveils its best trick: the only thing that can defeat Samus Aran is Samus Aran. Going from the hunter to the hunted is what has defined the series, and the innovations here helped the game rise above being on the B-tier, hidden behind a GameCube game.

It might not have the glitz of newer sectors, but it stitches together over 5% of the U.S. GDP, translating to $1.3 trillion annually . For savvy investors, the search for the best transportation stocks begins here, blending tradition with tremendous potential. Moreover, even in the face of economic drizzles, some transportation companies sail smoothly, showing us their tenacity. While the broader stock market might occasionally catch a cold, those in the know are spotting golden opportunities. Among those are transportation stocks with rock-solid foundations. Furthermore, shopping sprees are set for a comeback as consumers\u2019 wanderlust for experiences settles down. For savvy investors, this hints at transportation giants focused on the movement of goods, especially those with tempting valuations. So, buckle up as we journey through three transportation stocks poised for a rewarding ride. Uber ( UBER ) Uber (NYSE: UBER ) has revved up to become the poster child of disruptive innovation. Displacing traditional taxis and pioneering the ride-sharing movement, Uber has effectively reshaped the dynamics of city transportation. But Uber didn\u2019t just stop at dropping you off at your destinations. Their progressive business plan brings food to your doorstep with Uber Eats. To go a mile further, they have revamped logistics with Uber Freight and Uber Business. The recent financial figures only underscore its relentless drive forward. Though its Q2 revenue of $9.23 billion narrowly missed projections, its net income of $394 million (or 18 cents per share) stole the show. In contrast was a staggering loss of $2.6 billion for the same quarter. It reported its first-ever quarterly operating profit of $326 million, along with a roaring free cash flow growth to $1.14 billion. This represents a near 200% bump from the prior year. Now, while it may not be rubbing shoulders with the elites in the S&P 500 just yet, the winds suggest it\u2019s prepping its grand entrance. Given its solid performances, it\u2019s undeniably one of the season\u2019s most unexpected yet delightful surprises. Canadian National Railway ( CNI ) Canadian National Railway (NYSE: CNI ) stands out as a robust pillar in the North American railroad landscape, bridging key territories across Canada and the midwestern U.S. Over the past decade, it has proven to be an excellent wealth compounder, delighting shareholders with a substantial 126% bump in its share price. It recently posted mixed earnings in its second-quarter, locking revenues at 4.06 billion CAD and grappling with an 8% drop in earnings-per-share compared to the prior year. However, the quarter was marred by a confluence of Canadian wildfires and economic ripples, viewed as transient clouds on CNI\u2019s horizon. Nevertheless, it still posted a budding 10% uptick in free cash flow, a testament to the company\u2019s resiliency. As we shift our gaze to the future, CNI holds a buoyant vision, forecasting potent growth between 10% to 15% in long-term earnings per share. Moreover, it promises 14.4% upside and a comforting 2.07% dividend yield. Boeing Co. ( BA ) Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA ), a titan in aerospace, is soaring to new heights. The aviation behemoth is renowned for its cutting-edge commercial jets and formidable defense systems. It posted an impressive Q2 revenue of $19.75 billion, eclipsing the projected $18.57 billion. This uptick can be credited to various factors, chiefly the resurgence in passenger traffic across the U.S., Europe, and Asia in the post-pandemic era. Furthermore, despite the headwinds stemming from supply chain hiccups and the recent blip around the Boeing 737 MAX, the company\u2019s trajectory remains skyward. A testament to this is the 12% jump in deliveries and a healthy 41% surge in revenues during its second-quarter. Pivoting to China, recent developments have bolstered Boeing\u2019s standing, marking a rebound from earlier setbacks. Given these indicators, Boeing\u2019s flight path looks set on a promising horizon.

Here\u2019s how to navigate the fall visiting season.", "content": "T he price of gas is rising. Air travel is a mess. But this fall, many college-bound high school seniors and their parents will spend days\u2014sometimes happily, sometimes not\u2014exploring far flung campuses. They may ask blunt questions of undergraduate guides; wander through dorms where the students aren\u2019t yet dressed; listen to lectures (if they get there on a weekday); snap touristy selfies with scenic views (at parents\u2019 insistence); or find that tours at the schools highest on their lists are already booked up, at least for fall weekends. While college visits done right (see the tips below) are still a valuable way to determine whether an institution is the right fit, taking an official tour of Princeton , Yale , Stanford , or Harvard won\u2019t earn you any points with the admissions office. Yes, many colleges do still consider what is called \u201cdemonstrated interest\u201d\u2014how eager a given applicant appears to be to attend the school\u2014in their admissions decisions. And historically, taking the tour was a good way to show interest. But today, no members of the Ivy League and none of the top 15 schools on Forbes\u2019 2023 America\u2019s Top Colleges even consider applicants\u2019 interest as a factor in admissions. Looking at the top 100 on the new Forbes list, only 48% of private schools and 23% of public schools take demonstrated interest into account, according to the latest information they\u2019ve provided to what\u2019s known as the Common Data Set. By contrast, 81% of those same private colleges (including all eight Ivies) consider legacy status \u2014meaning whether an applicant is the child of a graduate, and particularly a wealthy one who might be or become a donor. (Among state schools in the top 100, only 27% consider legacy.) Moreover, even those admissions officers who care about demonstrated interest measure it by a lot more than just who schleps to campus. They count interactions at college fairs and high school visits and how many times the student contacts the admissions office. And, like any good marketer, they track open rates and click through rates on emails. Then there\u2019s the University of Michigan (the highest ranked public college on the Forbes list that\u2019s outside of California ). It doesn\u2019t track clicks or visits, but factors in a student\u2019s interest based on how they respond to an essay question asking what attracts them to the program they\u2019re applying to, reports Kelly Cox, senior associate director of recruitment and operations with the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Rice University in Houston does the same. Giving extra points for a college visit has fallen out of favor for several reasons. One is equity (though that doesn\u2019t seem to have killed legacy preference). Not everyone can afford a cross-country flight or weekend road trip to visit campus, says Jaime Soto, senior associate director of admissions for recruitment and communications at the University of Washington . Another reason is volume, he says. UWash, which received more than 55,000 applications across its three campuses for the 2020-21 academic year, doesn\u2019t have the time or resources to track the engagement habits of all of those applicants. This is a widespread problem: With more colleges using a common application form and going test-optional, high school seniors aiming for college are each applying to more schools. In 2022, according to Common App data , the average student put in 6.2 college applications, up from 4.6 in 2014. Finally, there\u2019s the enduring impact of the Covid-19 pandemic\u2014a time when colleges temporarily canceled in-person classes along with applicant visits, and beefed up their online campus tours. Kevin Donohue, assistant director of admissions at Dartmouth College and a 2021 grad, gave live virtual tours during the pandemic\u2014as an undergraduate, he\u2019d walk around campus with a gliding camera and answer questions that viewers submitted through a chatbox. One student loved the experience so much he attended Donohue\u2019s tour three times, he reports. Most schools have retained these virtual offerings. So why do parents and students bother coming to campus? Because it really does affect students\u2019 decisions. A fall visit is particularly important if a student is going to apply to a school for early decision. Under the rules, if a student is admitted through early decision and receives adequate financial aid, they are required to commit to that school and withdraw their applications from any others. (This differs from early action, where students apply and receive a decision ahead of time but do not need to commit to the school.) Donohue offers his first, junior year visit to Dartmouth as an object lesson. \u201cIt was a rainy April day. It was just miserable out \u2026 and I remember just loving it.\u201d At lunch he told his mom he was going to Dartmouth and applied early decision the next fall. \u201cThe joke that we make in college admissions is that if you visit a campus on a less than ideal weather day and fall in love, it means you found your home,\u2019\u2019 echoes Jennifer Ziegenfus, assistant vice chancellor for admissions at the University of Colorado, Boulder . Ziegenfus notes touring parents can sometimes seem more enthusiastic than their kids\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean the students aren\u2019t influenced. The tour starting point at her campus is a statue of a mascot buffalo (Ralphie, he\u2019s called) framed by the Rocky Mountains. \u201cThe picture is one of the most iconic photos you can take on the entire campus. I have seen family members take a photo and the students be extremely resistant to taking the photo because they were essentially dragged to the visit,\u201d she says. \u201cThey might be coming from across the country or right down the street, and mom and dad make them take this photo.\u2019\u2019 Later, she adds, some of those same students become graduates with a different attitude. \u201cThey take this iconic photo, they keep it on their phone, and then years later they come back to show us.\u201d Embarrassing selfies aren\u2019t the only potentially problematic dynamic involving parents. Michigan\u2019s Cox notes it can be less than ideal \u201cwhen the parent is an alumnus of the institution and they\u2019re excited to be back and they had a positive experience and are hoping to share. They can take over the tour a bit and not leave it to the tour guide.\u201d There\u2019s also the game day visit, \u201cif there\u2019s tailgates and you see some activity on a Saturday morning from students pregaming so to speak.\u2019\u2019 (That, for you parents, means drinking in advance of a game.) \u201cParents may look at that and think, \u2018Oh, I dunno if this is really what we want for our students. And on the other hand, students might be looking at that thinking, \u2018Wow, this is awesome,\u2019\u201d he says. Then there\u2019s the issue of coordinating dorm tours. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of reports back from our guys where they got there, entered the room and surprised some people who either are still in bed or not fully dressed for the day, and there\u2019s a group of 15 strangers walking in\u201d says Cox. \u201cIt\u2019s part of working with college students early in the weekend morning.\u201d N ow that campus visits are back in vogue, the biggest issue may just be getting all the tour slots you want. Between their twin sons and 13-month-younger daughter, Greg Tole and his wife Tosia of Denville, New Jersey, have three children who will be starting college next fall. During their 2023 spring break, Tole took his sons to visit schools in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia, while his wife did a separate swing with their daughter. \u201cI prefer that my kids view quite a few schools because I think there\u2019s a certain vibe that you can get that\u2019s either going to be really appealing, or not,\u201d Tole says. Their efforts to plan the perfect trips were thwarted, however, when he realized that openings at several of their target colleges were already full. Tole couldn\u2019t get a guided tour at Clemson University or James Madison University, and his wife couldn\u2019t snag a time at the University of Georgia. Indeed, though the admissions cycle for fall 2024 has only just begun, listed weekend tour dates at some highly selective colleges are already booked. At Harvard University, currently scheduled tours run through mid-November, and all weekend slots are filled. At Princeton, weekend tours are booked through October. (Early action applications are due by November 1 at both those Ivies.) If you\u2019re keen on a tour, but all of the available times are booked, admissions officials suggest calling their offices\u2014it\u2019s possible the school might add additional time slots or keep a waitlist. (CU Boulder\u2019s Ziegenfus also suggests clicking on a full date online, because that sometimes takes you to the sign-up page for the wait list.) One tool Tole found helpful in his planning: College Scoops, an online service that for $99 a year (or $9.95 a month), offers virtual guidebooks to 101 colleges, designed to be useful to both parents and students. There are hotel recommendations, lists of nearby restaurants, interactive maps, links to register for guided campus tours and self-guided trip itineraries for each campus. Moira McCullough, an Osterville, Massachusetts, mother of three, says she launched the service in 2019 because her first college visit with her oldest son was a disappointment. \u201cI was so excited to get one kid in the car, drive six hours, learn everything I can about my son\u2014all his desires and what he wanted to be and what he wanted to study,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it was an absolute disaster.\u201d What her son wanted was \u201cthe experience of a dress rehearsal,\u201d she says. Instead, \u201che walked away from that visit thinking \u2018This is where I\u2019m going to live, learn and grow, and all I learned was what I had read about on the website and the brochures.\u2019\u201d So College Scoops offers answers from current undergraduates to such real life questions as where they eat, workout, party and park their cars, enabling kids considering a school to check out where they\u2019ll actually spend time\u2014beyond the classrooms and what\u2019s in the glossy, admission-office produced brochure.", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 10:30:00", "image_url": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/64fb47f585acb9effef9e2d3/0x0.jpg", "source_id": "forbes", "source_priority": 57, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["politics"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "11c89fbbf51997d414c674e818ccd7e5", "title": "Germany vs. Serbia 2023 FIBA World Cup Final Odds, Time, and Prediction", "link": "https://www.gamblingnews.com/news/germany-vs-serbia-2023-fiba-world-cup-final-odds-time-and-prediction/", "keywords": ["Sports"], "creator": ["Jessie Carter"], "video_url": null, "description": "Germany has a chance to win its first-ever FIBA World Cup on Sunday, September 10, 2023.

Serbia vs. Germany FIBA World Cup Odds *Odds taken from FanDuel on Friday, September 8. When, Where, and How to Watch? Germany Coming Off a Win Over Team US The United States men\u2019s national basketball team was the No. 1 favorite to win the 2023 FIBA World Cup before the start of the tournament. Until Friday, it seemed as if the bookies were right to favor the Americans. But then, Team US lost to Germany 113-111. It was a close win for the Germans especially after Team US players switched to the top gear in the final couple of minutes of the game. But Germany was able to survive, mostly thanks to its players\u2019 brilliant offensive output. GERMANY STUN USA TO GO TO THE WORLD CUP FINAL. Truth be told, the Americans didn\u2019t seem too interested in the defense, which allowed Germany to score so many points. In fact, 113 points is the most these guys have scored in a game since 2014 when they beat Luxemburg 118-66. Should you expect the Germans to continue their offensive brilliance and score as many points in the 2023 FIBA World Cup? Not really. After all, they\u2019re playing against a team with arguably the most disciplined defense in the world. Svetislav Pesic Preparing Another Basketball Masterclass When you think of Serbian basketball, your mind probably goes straight to . But \u201cJoker\u201d isn\u2019t with the Serbia national team in the Philippines. Instead, this team\u2019s biggest star is , who\u2019s been getting limited time on the court in the NBA as an Atlanta Hawks shooting guard. Bogdan Bogdanovic continued his hot streak on offense to push Serbia to the Final and earn TCL Player of the Game honors \ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udcca 23 PTS | 4 REB | 3 AST | 3 STL | 67% FG | 28 EFF x \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddf8 | This team might not be packed with superstars, but Serbia works great as a collective. This isn\u2019t surprising given that the team is coached by , a 74-year-old coach who won a World Cup in 2002 while at the helm of former Yugoslavia. After winning the 2002 World Cup in Indianapolis, Pesic coached a number of elite European clubs, including Bayern Munich, where he stayed for nearly four years. Further, at one point in his career, he was even the head coach of the Germany national basketball team. 2023 FIBA World Cup Final Prediction With Pesic as their coach, the Serbs have every right to hope for a good result on Sunday. If there\u2019s a man who can prepare a strategy needed to beat the Germans in the final, it\u2019s him. Plus, you can be 100% certain that his boys are going to give everything on the court of the Mall of Asia Arena. It\u2019s not just about becoming the champions of the world, it\u2019s also about making their struggling friend happy.

Ahead, you\u2019ll learn incredible tips and home hacks that will prevent your home from looking cheap and outdated. Keep scrolling to discover 30 minor things that make a big impact when you want to take your humble abode to the next level. 01 Removing brass outlet covers Bill Samuel, a residential real estate developer at , suggests staying clear of brass materials in your home. \"If you have any brass hardware in your house, this will make your space look dated and cheap,\u201d he explains. \u201cBrass hardware was a common builder-grade finish back in the \u201880s and \u201890s so people typically associate this style as old and cheap. Swapping out this hardware for newer modern looking hardware will give your living area a more modern and custom appearance.\" Available in a set of two in either matte black or white, these will give a modern finish to your wall. They come with all of the necessary mounting screws for an easy installation. 02 Using bright outlet covers for a cleaner appearance \"Older outlets that are almond colored or painted over can make your living room look cheap as well,\u201d says Samuel. Pick up this white that\u2019s earned a 4.7-star rating on Amazon and will achieve a clean fresh look throughout your home. \u201cMake sure your outlets/switches/covers are paint free and bright white to give your living room space a clean finished look,\u201d he continues. 03 Adding skirting boards & trim Joe Ferguson, Architectural Joiner at , recommends adding baseboard trims for a quick and easy way to elevate your walls. \"Skirting boards and trim [are] the best way to fix awkward terminations and can help soften the look of a room. Best used between ceiling and walls to blur termination,\u201d says Ferguson. This is super easy to install. After you measure your wall, simply cut the flexible adhesive to your desired length and stick it on. It also makes for an affordable solution to mask cracks and damaged corners. \u201cTrims can also be used to add accentuate door jambs as well as decorate furniture and hide imperfections,\u201d he adds. 04 Replacing your mailbox Shlomo Cherniak, contractor and owner of , told Mic, \u201cSomething I've done a lot, replace the mailbox. It's inexpensive and simple to do.\u201d This from Amazon comes with a customizable address kit that includes over 70 matching vinyl numbers. The numbers can be mounted vertically or horizontally. \u201cIf your mailbox is near the road, people passing by notice it. If it's on your house, it adds to the curb appeal of your front entry. Over time, your mailbox starts looking a bit rough. Or worse, it looks like it's about to fall off the post. Replacing with a new more decorative mailbox is an easy home fix,\u201d he explains. 05 Fixing leaky faucets Kamil Kowalski, President of , recommends buying to easily fix a leaky faucet. \"Leaky faucets can often be fixed with a simple washer change. If your faucet is dripping, it\u2019s likely the washer has worn out and needs to be replaced. Do-it-yourselfers can quickly replace the washer and be done with this easy fix in a matter of minutes,\u201d says Kowalski. This pack from Amazon comes with 58 pieces that include everything you need to fix your faucet. From flat and beveled washers to a variety of brass screws, you\u2019ll be set. 06 Replacing your lightbulbs David Nicholas, an electrician at , loves these that give off a retro-warm light to create a cozy ambiance. Nicholas explains, \"As a professional electrician, in my opinion, one of the simplest fixes homeowners can do is change out their standard lightbulbs for the modern Edison type that prominently displays the filament.\u201d \u201cThese bulbs are common in high-end bars and restaurants as they produce a warm glow that is less harsh on the eyes than traditional LEDs and help create a relaxing environment,\u201d he continues. \u201cHarsh LED lighting also has the negative effect of highlighting imperfections on the walls and ceilings, which these Edison-style bulbs overcome\u201d 07 Re-painting your walls Painting your walls is no easy feat, but the best place to start is by making sure you have all of the right tools. For instance, these are a must for protecting your floors and furniture from paint. As Bruce Rodriguez, the owner of , explains, \"Many people think that painting is a simple task, but there are actually quite a few things to consider before starting a paint job. For instance, you need to choose the right type of paint for the job, as well as make sure you have all the necessary supplies \u2014 drop cloths, tape, etc.\" Snag these cloths in a pack of three for just under $10. 08 Using plants to refresh the air When it comes to creating an inviting environment, Muhammad Waqar, Founder & CEO of , recommends plants. \u201cAdd some greenery: A lack of greenery can make a home look sterile and uninviting,\u201d Waqar says. These from Amazon come in a pack of four and help to purify the air inside your home by filtering out toxins and pollutants. Whether you keep one on your desk, in your kitchen, on your window sill, or give it as a gift, you can\u2019t go wrong. 09 Adding floating shelves Waqar also suggests investing in floating shelves to help declutter your space, saying, \u201cCluttered countertops or lack of storage can make a home look messy and disorganized. Installing floating shelves like the can provide extra storage while also adding a touch of style to a room.\" With over 2,600 five-star reviews, these shelves are definitely popular. The set of two measures 16.5 inches long by 12 inches wide. They come in seven different color styles available to match any room. 10 Replacing cabinet hardware \"Old, worn, or mismatched hardware can make a home look outdated and unkempt,\u201d Waqar adds. \u201cUpgrading hardware on cabinets, doors, and drawers can add a touch of modernity and uniformity to a home. A product like the can help achieve a sleek, cohesive look in any room.\" With an impressive 4.8-star rating, thousands of shoppers agree that the steel handles are better than the expensive options on the market. Snag them in nine different lengths (ranging from five to 15 inches) and a variety of colors ranging from black to silver. 11 Replacing baseboards Elevated renovations don\u2019t have to break the bank. \"Thin or poorly installed baseboards can make a home look cheap and unfinished,\u201d says Waqar. \u201cInstalling high-quality, thick baseboards like can add a touch of elegance to a room while also hiding gaps between the floor and the wall.\" Measured at 60 feet per roll, this wall base comes in a silver-grey finish and can be bought in a five-pack for bigger jobs or spaces. 12 Fixing interior & exterior cracks If you\u2019re looking for a cheap fix to repair cracks, Scott Chambers, carpenter, contractor, and content editor of , has the answer. \"Cracks in exterior and interior walls can easily be fixed with caulk \u2014 sometimes referred to as \u2018builders caulk\u2019 \u2014 which should ensure a smooth, professional finish if it's applied carefully and will prevent the cracks that it\u2019s been used to repair from getting worse or allowing any insect or rodents to get into your home through said cracks,\u201d advises Chambers. This is the best alternative to spackling and works best for big damages like large cracks and holes. \u201cBest of all though? It\u2019s easy to use and you don\u2019t need to be a pro to use it to mend cracking,\u201d says Chambers. 13 Patching up drafty spots Chambers also says he\u2019s a \u201cbig fan of draft excluders and window sealants because even professionally fitted windows and doors can let a draft in, and out, adding a zero or two to your heating bills over time. Again, they\u2019re easy fixes that can be used to decrease your bills and ensure your home stays warm when you want, and need it to.\u201d This is available in black or white and can be bought from three to five millimeters. Not only is the foam material totally waterproof but it also refrains from dust build-up. The adhesive strip requires no glue \u2014 just simply peel, stick, and place. 14 Using attractive lighting Troy Shaffer, the founder of , says that \"Adding new lighting fixtures or updating existing ones can make a big difference in the overall look of a room.
