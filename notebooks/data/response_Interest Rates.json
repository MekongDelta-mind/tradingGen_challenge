Batman is one of the most iconic superheroes of all-time. The character has been popular for over 80 years thanks to his incredible comics, TV shows (both live action and animated), films, and of course, games. Batman has endured some painful installments in all of those mediums as well, but generally, it's a character that people keep going back to and enjoying. Batman has also spawned other characters that have spun-off into their own solo adventures such as Joker, Robin, and many others. After the incredible success of the Batman Arkham series, WB decided to try and see if Batman's superhero family could successfully be spun off into their own game. With that, the co-op game Gotham Knights was born. Unfortunately, the game was met with a mixed reception and didn't seem to sell terribly well. Many assumed that would mean the game would probably be swept under the rug, but it seems like that's not the case. Gotham Knights appears to be making a return soon via the Nintendo Switch. Both the ESRB and a Singapore ratings board have rated Gotham Knights for Nintendo Switch. These are new ratings and come from two different sources, which suggests it's real. It's also worth noting that cloud-based games don't get rated for Nintendo Switch, so this would likely be native to the console. You can view the rating description via the ESRB below. Gotham Knights has been rated for Nintendo Switch in Singapore. pic.twitter.com/TV9RwzUhp1 \u2014 Andrew Marmo (@the_marmolade) September 9, 2023 \"This is an action role-playing game in which players control one of four Batman Family members through missions around Gotham City. Players explore open-world environments while investigating crime scenes and fighting criminals/villains. Players mostly engage in melee-style combat using punches, kicks, and takedowns to defeat enemies. Combat is highlighted by impact sounds, cries of pain, occasional gunfire, and explosions. Stealth attacks and takedowns result in brief cutscenes: characters slamming enemies' heads into floors/walls; kicks/knees to the head; close-range gunshots to enemies' torsos. Blood stains are sometimes depicted on wounded characters' faces and/or clothing and splattered around crime scenes; some bodies can be examined for autopsy during investigations. The game contains several alcohol references (e.g., wine, beer, whiskey, drunkenness), and one scene depicts a villain drinking whiskey. Some characters can be seen smoking in various areas of Gotham City. The words \"sh*t\" and \"a*shole\" appear in the game.\" It's also worth noting that games are typically rated toward the end of their development. If this rating is appearing now, it signifies that this could be released very soon, possibly in time for the game's one year anniversary in October. There have been rumblings of a new Nintendo Direct lately, so this could be something that gets announced there. The rumored release is fairly interesting as the game was only released on Xbox Series X |S, PS5, and PC before and the Nintendo Switch is more in-line with last-gen hardware.

The author gained fame as a novelist fine-tuned to examine the many layers of intrigue, rivalry, deception, ruthlessness and intelligence employed in the epic battle between East and West in the second half of the 20th century, one that, rather remarkably, never exploded into World War III. A hefty miniseries would be required to illuminate and express all the knowledge and expertise brought to bear in le Carr\u00e9\u2019s voluminous output (he wrote 31 books and much else). The similarly prodigious Morris patiently waited until the author, whose real name was David Cornwall, was ready to sit down and talk; it was, unsurprisingly, the author\u2019s final interview, as he died shortly thereafter, in December 2009. The result overflows with fascinating material, even as you get the sense that what we\u2019re hearing and seeing represents the mere tip of a self-protective iceberg. Such was the life of spies and the man who so acutely wrote about what he knew of them. Related Stories Breaking News Errol Morris's Henry Kissinger Project? Not Gonna Happen. Director Says Foreign Policy Giant \"Got Cold Feet\" - Telluride Breaking News Documentary On Spy Novelist John Le Carr\u00e9, AKA David Cornwell, Coming From Apple TV+, The Ink Factory And Oscar Winner Errol Morris The first thing you notice about the film is how elaborate it is \u2014 word is that it cost $10 million to make, a great deal for a documentary. Morris loads it with information and insights, as well as abundant narration, music and interstitial shots, including the titular pigeons being released and shot at by sportsmen. But there is one aspect that is even more evident: In his on-camera narration and storytelling, le Carr\u00e9 speaks with abundant authority, clarity and specificity, with every word ready to be spoken and never an \u201cum,\u201d hesitation, pause, redundancy, self-correction or momentary uncertainty. His delivery could not be more confident and clear, his memory impeccable, even though he was nearly 90 when he died in 2020. The major factor in his life, at least the first part of it, was his mother\u2019s abandonment of the family, when the lad was 5 years old, to run off with another man; he only ever met his mum again decades later. His education sent him hither and yon, without much parental intimacy; he learned multiple languages, taught, moved into the intelligence corps (a story unto itself) and had two novels published before breaking through in 1963 with the international bestseller The Spy Who Came in from the Cold . Only then did he leave his government job to become a full-time writer. Morris crams his work with insightful talk not only from the horse\u2019s mouth but numerous observers and former colleagues; as he insists, \u201cA writer\u2019s task is to steal from life.\u201d The author sits with his interlocutor in a simple elegant room and it\u2019s a rare occasion to see the often tricky Morris treating his subject as a full equal, as well he might. Both of them are listeners highly attuned to what is being said to them, and Morris has, not infrequently, shrewdly set up his subjects in order to drop bombs on them in the hope of triggering some strong reaction, which sometimes has opened a door on the truth. There\u2019s no need for such subterfuge with le Carr\u00e9, not that Morris would get away with any tidbits of information that the subject might try to trick the cagy old spy into revealing. Thus a very agreeable balance is achieved, one which sees both men live up to their reputations as very smart fellows who could never be pressured into spilling any beans. There is much to revel in here, a quite special occasion on which to enjoy two very smart and experienced men with many interesting things to say about many things. No spy will ever willingly reveal everything, but what we get here is more than enough for one evening.

(Sep)NOTE: Previews are listed in day orderNORWEGIAN CPI (MON): The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced.UK UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES (TUE): Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end.UK GDP ESTIMATE (WED): A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought.US CPI (WED): Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern.ECB ANNOUNCEMENT (THU): 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%.AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYMENT (THU): participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms.SWEDISH CPIF (THU): July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak.US RETAIL SALES (THU): Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July. While the data set will offer a glimpse on the health of the consumer amid concerns that the economy may slow significantly in the months ahead, traders will also be watching the University of Michigan's prelim survey release due Friday, where the rise in energy prices is likely to have weighed on sentiment.CHINESE ACTIVITY DATA (FRI): Retail sales Y/Y in August are expected to rise by 2.8% (prev. 2.5%), whilst there is currently no consensus for Industrial Production metrics. The data will be closely watched to diagnose the health of the world\u2019s second-larger economy and to gauge the drip-feed of stimulus seen over recent weeks. Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d.This article originally appeared on Newsquawk This article was written by Newsquawk Analysis at www.forexlive.com.", "content": ": The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August.

A Haunting in Venice is Kenneth Branagh \u2019s third venture in this territory and may have finally found his rhythm with these films. In addition to Branagh, the film stars Tina Fey, Michelle Yeoh , Kelly Reilly, Jamie Dornan, Camille Cottin, and others. In Venice 1947, Hercule Periot (Branaugh) is retired and no longer a detective, but Adriane (Fey), a mystery novel writer looking for her next hit story, convinces him to accompany her to a seance to find out if the medium chosen for the event is a liar. What they find is that this home is the location of a tragedy. The current owner of the Palazzo, Rowena (Reilly), an opera singer, has contacted a medium Ms Reynolds (Yeoh) to connect with a relative who died there. Related Stories Labor 'Oppenheimer' Cast Leaves London Premiere Before Screening As SAG-AFTRA's Official Strike Call Looms Breaking News 'Murder Is Easy': David Jonsson, Morfydd Clark & Penelope Wilton Among Cast Of Agatha Christie Adaptation For BBC & BritBox International There is tension in the air, as weird things begin to happen like falling chimneys, and doors blowing open, but it isn\u2019t enough to convince everyone that there are ghosts there. Ms. Reynolds makes contact with other spirits in the home. She does make contact with someone who was murdered in the house but before anyone can find out what happened to her, the medium awakes from the trance. Now that this has gone from the supernatural to a murder mystery, Periot\u2019s interest is peaked as he aims to get to the answers Ms. Reynold couldn\u2019t. From the start, the mystery unfolds at a steady pace. While there\u2019s a heightened sense of anticipation, the plot is somewhat predictable. This, however, does not take away from the experience but plot events aren\u2019t as exciting as the film wants them to be. However, in terms of tone, A Haunting in Venice finds a maturity that its predecessors perhaps lacked. There\u2019s a balanced seriousness that anchors the narrative with a subtle blend of elements that are well executed. One feature of Branagh\u2019s direction in this installment is his peculiar choice of framing characters off-center. This unusual style could be interpreted in many ways: perhaps as a reflection of the misaligned motives of the characters or simply a different approach to classic storytelling. The cast, which includes the likes of Michelle Yeoh, Tina Fey, Jamie Dornan, Kelly Reilly, and Camille Cotton, all deliver measured performances that steer clear of the theatricality that can sometimes plague mystery adaptations. It\u2019s a cast with real chemistry that blends well together. The film benefits from its scaled-down approach. Previous adaptations, with their star-studded casts and expansive settings, felt vast\u2014perhaps too vast for the intimate mysteries Christie writes. In the film, here\u2019s a welcome return to a more confined space. Fewer characters allow for a deeper dive into each persona. As this tale is one of Christie\u2019s lesser-known works, adapting it was a clever choice, filling in the gaps and nuances that the book might have left ambiguous. There is a consistent conundrum regarding the continuation of these adaptations, given their minor success. With enormous budgets and A-list casts in the past, it was time to see A Haunting in Venice take a step back. This film appears to be more in line with Christie\u2019s intent. Her narratives often thrived in confinement, sometimes to the point of being claustrophobic. Venice, with its labyrinthine canals and narrow alleyways, serves as the perfect backdrop for such a tale. This smaller scope and concise storytelling make this film the standout in Branagh\u2019s Christie trilogy. A Haunting in Venice seems to have captured the essence of what makes Agatha Christie\u2019s works timeless. By scaling down and focusing on the smaller elements of both the plot and the characters, Branagh and his team have delivered a film that is both an homage to Christie and a film that far exceeds the first two.

Congress will soon take up votes on repealing outdated authorizations for use of military force, or AUMFs, which provide statutory authority for military operations in the Middle East. It\u2019s fitting that these AUMFs are up for repeal as we approach and reflect on the anniversary of Sept. 11, a catalyst event that propelled the United States to war in the greater Middle East more than 20 years ago. Over the past two decades, U.S. involvement in conflicts including Iraq and Afghanistan have rung up an unimaginably high toll. The cost of the Global War on Terror has reached over just for the war operations themselves. These numbers just skim the surface. It\u2019s not simply the direct cost of executing war. It\u2019s the cost affecting the fabric of our communities for generations after decades of war. The Department of Veterans Affairs has seen a new wave of post-9/11 veterans with needs unique to their wars. The VA budget has increased since 2000 to . That is $25 billion from just the previous year. The cost of care for post-9/11 veterans is estimated to soar up to an astonishing by 2050, even as the overall number of veterans the VA serves is declining. of post-9/11 veterans have some form of disability rating with the VA so far and receive dollars and/or services for their injuries. PTSD and traumatic brain injuries are the defining injuries of these wars, leading to stunningly high , and . Estimates suggest more GWOT veterans have died of suicide than died in combat. The physical injuries come with their own set of challenges, including the need for treatment aids like prosthetics, service animals and adaptive homes. All the while, veterans exposed to toxins and burn pits on their deployments are coping with cancers and illnesses they\u2019d never have imagined they\u2019d be plagued with. None of the above makes the transition out of service any easier. Like Americans always do, we\u2019ve risen to the challenge to care for veterans and meet their needs. Veterans organizations all over the country do their best to ensure veterans have what they need to thrive in post-service life. But that noble work copes with the symptoms of congressional malaise \u2014 the legislature\u2019s persistent unwillingness to make tough, responsible decisions about military engagement. as an alternative to declaring war. While the intention may be good, overly broad poorly written AUMFs can evolve into instruments that perpetuate the cycle of conflict if not subject to proper oversight. The AUMFs up for repeal are a prime example. The 1957, 1991 and 2002 AUMFs each authorized some form of engagement in the Middle East \u2014 combatting communism through security assistance and authorizing operations in the first and second Iraq Wars, respectively. None of these AUMFs are the sole authority for any ongoing operations, yet they remain a potentially abusable back door to conflict without a congressional vote. Multiple presidents and military leaders have leaned on open AUMFs to justify actions outside the original intention of the authorizations. These operations can have dire consequences such as the devastating attack on in Niger in 2017. Keeping AUMFs on the books just leaves the door open for more long-term deployments to all reaches of the globe to fight enemies that don\u2019t threaten core national interests. Unfortunately, Congress just lets this happen. After all, the AUMFs were voted on at some point, right? Why take on the hard work and burden of scrutinizing whether existing AUMFs are still appropriate or whether troops to be sent to war? The blunt answer is because millions still bear the hidden costs of war and thousands of men and women have died in defense of the Constitution that requires it. I served in the Army and Navy for 22 years. I saw friends die on the battlefield and witnessed their struggles when they came home. I have dealt with my own health problems and read too many stories and accounts of veterans who take their own lives daily. Those of us who served are more than just numbers and statistics. We are the tip of the spear who live the consequences of our leaders\u2019 decisions. The least Congress can do is honor our oath to the Constitution by debating and voting on matters of war. If a situation arises that requires military action, Congress can address it at that point, not just rely on blank check authorization to get them out of doing their job. I urge members of Congress to reclaim their constitutional responsibility and shut the open doors that are the 1957, 1991 and 2002 AUMFs through repeal.", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 19:00:00", "image_url": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/youngtodd_kainetim_031623ag01_w.jpg?w=900", "source_id": "thehill", "source_priority": 393, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "383606ac935ae770c06078f76b6afd7a", "title": "Biden, Modi and G-20 allies unveil rail and shipping project linking India to Middle East and Europe", "link": "https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-09-09/biden-modi-and-g20-allies-unveil-rail-and-shipping-project-linking-india-to-middle-east-and-europe", "keywords": null, "creator": null, "video_url": null, "description": "President Biden and his allies have outlined plans to create a rail and shipping corridor linking India with the Middle East and ultimately Europe.", "content": "President Biden and his allies on Saturday announced plans to build a rail and shipping corridor linking India with the Middle East and Europe, an ambitious project aimed at fostering economic growth and political cooperation . \u201cThis is a big deal,\u201d said Biden. \u201cThis is a really big deal.\u201d The corridor , outlined at the annual Group of 20 summit of the world\u2019s top economies, would help boost trade, deliver energy resources and improve digital connectivity. It would include India, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Israel and the European Union, said Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s national security advisor. Sullivan said the network reflected Biden\u2019s vision for \u201cfar-reaching investments\u201d that come from \u201ceffective American leadership\u201d and a willingness to embrace other nations as partners. He said the enhanced infrastructure would boost economic growth, help bring countries in the Middle East together and establish that region as a hub for economic activity instead of as a \u201csource of challenge, conflict or crisis\u201d as it has been in recent history. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi , European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other leaders from around the world participated in the announcement. \u201cEnhancing connectivity with all regions has been a key priority for India,\u201d said Modi, speaking through an interpreter. \u201cWe believe that connectivity is a means to not only increase mutual trade between different countries but also increase mutual trust.\u201d The rail and shipping corridor would help physically tie together a vast stretch of the globe, improving digital connectivity and enabling more trade among countries, including with energy products such as hydrogen. Although White House officials did not set a timeline for its completion, the corridor would provide a physical and ideological alternative to China\u2019s own nation-spanning infrastructure program. The White House gave no details on the project\u2019s cost or financing, though Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman mentioned a figure of $20 billion during the announcement. It was unclear whether that sum applied solely to the Saudi commitment. After the announcement, Biden greeted the crown prince with a hearty handshake , a friendlier exchange than when they last met, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, just over a year ago. At that time, Biden, who had harshly criticized Prince Mohammed over the kingdom\u2019s human rights record, awkwardly greeted him with a fist bump, a moment roundly criticized by rights activists. Von der Leyen described the project as a \u201cgreen and digital bridge across continents and civilizations.\u201d She added that it includes cables to transmit electricity and data. She also announced a \u201cTrans-African Corridor\u201d connecting the Angolan port of Lobito with landlocked areas of the continent: the Kananga province in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the copper-mining regions of Zambia. Speaking of the African project, Biden called it a \u201cgame-changing regional investment\u201d and said \u201cboth of these are huge, huge steps forward.\u201d Amos Hochstein, Biden\u2019s coordinator for global infrastructure and energy security, laid out a rough timeline for the project over the next year. In the next 60 days, working groups will put together a fuller plan and set timelines. The first phase will involve identifying the areas that need investment and where physical infrastructure can be connected between countries. Hochstein said the plans can be put into place over the next year so that the project can move onto setting up finances and construction. Sullivan said the project started coming together after Biden visited Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in July 2022, where he emphasized a need for greater regional economic integration. In January, the White House started having conversations with regional partners about the concept. By spring, maps and written assessments of existing rail infrastructure in the Middle East were being drafted. Sullivan, and senior White House aides Hochstein and Brett McGurk, traveled to Saudi Arabia in May to meet with their Indian, Saudi and UAE counterparts. All sides have worked since then to finalize details of the agreement announced Saturday. The parties also brought Israel and Jordan into the project. Saudi Arabia and Israel do not have diplomatic relations, though the White House has been pushing them toward normalizing relations. Sullivan said the transportation project is not seen as a \u201cprecursor\u201d to a potential normalization deal but he characterized Israel\u2019s inclusion as \u201csignificant.\u201d \u201cThe participants in this effort are focused on practical outcomes that deliver for their people,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cAnd a corridor of this kind by dint of geography works best having Israel in as opposed to out and the countries participating prioritized that.\u201d Biden participated in both G20 sessions on Saturday. He highlighted plans to push for more investments to address climate change, such as his own domestic incentives to encourage the use of renewable energy. He also argued that Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is hurting many other nations, which have had to cope with greater food and energy costs as well as higher interest rate costs on their debt. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been a regular presence at international summits, including last year\u2019s G20 in Indonesia, since Russia invaded his country more than 18 months ago, was not invited by Modi\u2019s government to this year\u2019s gathering. Zelensky has used the high-profile gatherings to argue for continued economic and military support for his country. India is one of the most prominent U.S. allies that has largely stayed on the sidelines of the war, and has even dramatically increased its purchases of Russian oil. Jon Finer, the White House principal deputy national security advisor, said the administration pushed for Zelensky\u2019s inclusion at the summit. \u201cUltimately, it is not our decision,\u201d Finer said. \u201cBut you can expect that the United States and our other partners who are working with Ukraine so closely ... We\u2019ll make that case quite forcefully in the context of these conversations.\u201d The summit communique, a joint statement agreed to by all participants, addressed the war, among other issues. It included language underlining the principle that states cannot use force to change borders, disavowed the use of nuclear weapons and called for a just peace based on the principles of the U.N. Charter. The communique also underscored that attacks on civilian infrastructure must end. During the summit, Biden also discussed his request to Congress for additional funding for the World Bank that could generate more than $25 billion in new lending for economic development. The White House more broadly is trying to strengthen the G20 as an international forum, while Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin decided not to attend. Biden has said he was disappointed by Xi\u2019s decision. Asked again about the Chinese leader\u2019s absence, Biden said Saturday that the summit \u201cis going well\u201d though \u201cit would be nice to have him here.\u201d", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 18:54:58", "image_url": null, "source_id": "latimes", "source_priority": 267, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "6dd53468c1a591412f7033c7b108722c", "title": "These Easy Home Upgrades Look Stunning &amp; Are Shockingly Affordable on Amazon", "link": "https://www.inverse.com/shopping/these-easy-home-upgrades-look-stunning-are-shockingly-affordable-on-amazon", "keywords": ["Affiliate", "affiliate-social"], "creator": ["Rachel Bar-Gadda"], "video_url": null, "description": "These affordable products will upgrade your home in minutes.", "content": "Impress for less.
