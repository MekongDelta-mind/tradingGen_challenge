The death toll has surged from the initial 296 figure that was reported by the interior ministry earlier today. The tremor struck late Friday night and had an initial 6.8 magnitude when it hit at 11.11pm local time, with shaking that lasted several seconds. Morocco's National Seismic Monitoring and Alert Network, however, said the earthqauke struck at a magnitude of 7.2 on the Richter scale. The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Ighil area of the High Atlas mountains, said the agency. A 4.9-magnitude aftershock was reported just 19 minutes after the earthquake, according to the US Geological Survey. Most of the deaths have occurred in mountainous areas that are hard to reach, the interior ministry said earlier.

(Sep)NOTE: Previews are listed in day orderNORWEGIAN CPI (MON): The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced.UK UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES (TUE): Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end.UK GDP ESTIMATE (WED): A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought.US CPI (WED): Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern.ECB ANNOUNCEMENT (THU): 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%.AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYMENT (THU): participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms.SWEDISH CPIF (THU): July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak.US RETAIL SALES (THU): Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July. While the data set will offer a glimpse on the health of the consumer amid concerns that the economy may slow significantly in the months ahead, traders will also be watching the University of Michigan's prelim survey release due Friday, where the rise in energy prices is likely to have weighed on sentiment.CHINESE ACTIVITY DATA (FRI): Retail sales Y/Y in August are expected to rise by 2.8% (prev. 2.5%), whilst there is currently no consensus for Industrial Production metrics. The data will be closely watched to diagnose the health of the world\u2019s second-larger economy and to gauge the drip-feed of stimulus seen over recent weeks. Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d.This article originally appeared on Newsquawk This article was written by Newsquawk Analysis at www.forexlive.com.", "content": ": The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August.

SEE MORE: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt to join Russia and China in economic bloc But others see BRICS as a rapidly growing superpower of nations, and the recent summit as a major show of influence for China. Earlier this year, China mediated the de-escalation between Saudi Arabia and Iran by helping to re-open diplomatic channels between them. In Africa, China has also made significant inroads by building infrastructure and growing its influence across the continent\u2014accomplishments that Chinese President Xi Jinping highlighted at the summit. \"Over the past decade, China has provided a large number of development assistance to Africa and has helped build more than 6,000 kilometers of railway, more than 6,000 kilometers of highway, and 80-plus large power facilities on the continent,\" Xi said. China alone has overtaken the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as the world's largest creditor, lending hundreds of billions of dollars across the globe. One of the central appeals of the BRICS group is its \"New Development Bank,\" intended to be an alternative lending option to the IMF and World Bank. Critics claim the United States holds too much power within the IMF and World Bank, which often impose lending requirements and penalties that are too stringent for the poorest countries. \"The pandemic has underscored once again how the global financial architecture is outdated, dysfunctional, and unjust. It has failed in its basic function as a global safety net,\" said Antonio Guterres, United Nations General Secretary. But the \"New Development Bank\" has come under fire for similar problems with transparency and strict loan requirements. And according to the Associated Press , at least a dozen countries indebted to China are now dedicating more than a third of their government revenues to paying off ballooning foreign debt. Doubling in size next year, BRICS has the potential for massive growth in influence over the next several years. But it still faces an uphill battle to unseat the economic and political clout of the G7 nations on the global stage.

In Africa, China has also made significant inroads by building infrastructure and growing its influence across the continent\u2014accomplishments that Chinese President Xi Jinping highlighted at the summit. \"Over the past decade, China has provided a large number of development assistance to Africa and has helped build more than 6,000 kilometers of railway, more than 6,000 kilometers of highway, and 80-plus large power facilities on the continent,\" Xi said. China alone has overtaken the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as the world's largest creditor, lending hundreds of billions of dollars across the globe. One of the central appeals of the BRICS group is its \"New Development Bank,\" intended to be an alternative lending option to the IMF and World Bank. Critics claim the United States holds too much power within the IMF and World Bank, which often impose lending requirements and penalties that are too stringent for the poorest countries. \"The pandemic has underscored once again how the global financial architecture is outdated, dysfunctional, and unjust. It has failed in its basic function as a global safety net,\" said Antonio Guterres, United Nations General Secretary. But the \"New Development Bank\" has come under fire for similar problems with transparency and strict loan requirements. And according to the , at least a dozen countries indebted to China are now dedicating more than a third of their government revenues to paying off ballooning foreign debt. Doubling in size next year, BRICS has the potential for massive growth in influence over the next several years. But it still faces an uphill battle to unseat the economic and political clout of the G7 nations on the global stage.", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 21:00:26", "image_url": null, "source_id": "tmj4", "source_priority": 7805, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "0c7792534aa68177a19eeb95b18be972", "title": "Savvy Games Group\u2019s strategy to become a force in gaming | Brian Ward interview", "link": "https://venturebeat.com/games/savvy-games-groups-strategy-to-become-a-force-in-gaming-brian-ward-interview/", "keywords": ["Business", "GamesBeat", "Gaming Business", "category-/Business & Industrial", "category-/News"], "creator": ["Dean Takahashi"], "video_url": null, "description": "Brian Ward, CEO of Savvy Gaming Group, is trying to change Saudi Arabia's reputation by leading its investments in gaming.", "content": "We're thrilled to announce the return of GamesBeat Next, hosted in San Francisco this October, where we will explore the theme of \"Playing the Edge.\" Apply to speak here and learn more about sponsorship opportunities here. At the event, we will also announce 25 top game startups as the 2024 Game Changers. Apply or nominate today ! Brian Ward, CEO of Savvy Games Group , has taken the lead in helping Saudi Arabia\u2019s attempt to move beyond its reputation for human rights abuses and being an oil nation to being a visionary technology leader bankrolling the game industry. This tension between the past and the future is ever-present in Saudi Arabia, where companies like Savvy Games Group \u2014 owned by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia \u2014 are trying to change perceptions through games while remaining cognizant of the kingdom\u2019s appetite for measured change. Ward believes people have to see the change happening in society on the ground in Saudi Arabia in order to understand how quickly things can happen under the new regime that is mostly supportive of the game industry. There is perhaps no other country where the clash between tradition and modernity \u2014 something my world history professor talked about so long ago \u2014 is so stark. The change and the deals have been happening at a dizzying rate. It\u2019s like a big game of Monopoly, and the playing board of the game industry is set up on a global scale. Savvy Games Group acquired Los Angeles-based mobile game publisher Scopely for $4.9 billion in April, and it bought a $1 billion stake in Sweden-based game publisher Embracer Group. It also acquired ESL Gaming and FaceIt in esports to create ESL FaceIt Group. And the Saudis have also bought stakes in Capcom, Nexon and Nintendo this year, building on stakes it acquired previously in Activision Blizzard, Take-Two Interactive and Electronic Arts. That has made the gaming world take notice. Savvy\u2019s big stakeholder, the Public Investment Fund (run by the Saudi Arabian government) is flush with cash from the oil boom and it has set aside $37.8 billion to build up Saudi Arabia\u2019s presence in the global games industry \u2013 with $13.3 billion of that earmarked for acquiring a major publisher. That\u2019s more money than anyone around the world is earmarking for gaming investments and acquisitions. It\u2019s a sign that the government is serious about weaning the country from oil. The Saudi Vision 2030 is a government program launched by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to diversify economically, socially and culturally, in line with the vision of bin Salman. The Saudis announced it in 2016, but the country remained about 74% dependent on oil exports as of 2021. The country understands that the oil economy could dry up in the next 27 years, and it has to have other jobs ready \u2014 and they are trickling in so far. For the games industry, this influx of Saudi money into games is not without controversy, as the Saudi funding is controversial and the company has only been at it since November 2021. Critics say that the regime of Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud doesn\u2019t respect human rights. As crown prince and prime minister, he was connected to the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 via alleged killers who had ties to the crown prince. Accepting funding from the Saudis under such a regime represents a moral quandary, as the Saudis have become a big source of funding in their efforts to diversify beyond their dependence on oil, which the world is in the process of moving away from in pursuit of clean energy. Saudi defenders say that all major sources of money in the world are tainted in some way, and accepting money from the Saudis does not mean you have to accept interference from the Saudis or embrace their agenda. Ward pointed out in an interview with GamesBeat that the country is undergoing change when it comes to women\u2019s rights and other freedoms, and it is serious about creating transformative results when it comes to diversity and new jobs associated with game studios. Still, given the fact that being gay is illegal in Saudi Arabia, The Last of Us Part 2 was banned in the country for having gay women in its leading roles. Ward has said the company aims to become a great games company and is not tied to a specific political agenda and he is not there for an \u201cimage makeover project.\u201d While change may be happening, it\u2019s not happening fast enough for critics. I caught up with Ward in an interview at the company\u2019s booth at the Gamescom expo in Cologne, Germany. Here\u2019s an edited transcript of our interview. Brian Ward: Sorry I wasn\u2019t able to meet before. GamesBeat: You guys were busy buying somebody. Brian Ward: That was a hectic time. GamesBeat: How are things going since then? Especially with acquiring Scopely. Ward: Very good. We\u2019re obviously delighted to have closed the transaction with Scopely. Their Monopoly Go product is fantastic. It\u2019s doing very well. The people are working super hard on integration. They\u2019ve been a pleasure to work with in that regard. So far we\u2019re delighted. GamesBeat: On things like esports, I wonder how much focus you have on MENA (Middle East/North Africa) versus the wider world. Ward: We\u2019re pretty globally focused. The live attendance on all the majors this year has been up. The viewership, the hours watched have been up. There have been some hiccups in the sector generally with publisher spend on esports this year, but overall the business has been doing great. We\u2019re focused on MENA, of course. The EFG folks are in the middle of executing on Gamers8. There are plans for that tournament to be bigger and more robust next year. There\u2019s a lot going on. The conference next week will be a good one. GamesBeat: Is that a first for them, or have they been doing them before? Ward: This is the second version of Next World Forum. Gamers8 started during COVID as Gamers Without Borders, for charity relief. This is the second version of both the G8 and the NWF. GamesBeat: Is there a feeling of progress as you come out of COVID? Esports had to take some huge hits during that time. It transformed a lot as well. Ward: I think we\u2019re beyond COVID. The capital markets, the economic situation last year and coming into this year, caused some publishers to pull back on their esports spend, which affected a couple of pieces of the business, but overall attendance is up. Viewership is up. There seems to be as much engagement as there was before from a fan point of view. GamesBeat: For Saudi gamers and Saudi esports fans, how would you describe the market? Ward: When we invested in EFG, it seemed that coming out of COVID \u2013 that was nearly two years ago now \u2013 it was an inflection point where engagement had changed or accelerated because of COVID, and there would be some consolidation in esports. There would be some dynamics that would sort themselves out, whether it\u2019s the relationship between players and teams and publishers and where the power base really sits. A lot of that still has to get sorted out. Team economics are not universally great. GamesBeat: The game industry itself, where do you see the trends developing? Ward: We\u2019re super excited, especially on the heels of closing Scopely. We\u2019re excited about mobile-first cross-platform opportunities. Scopely is also making great progress in direct payments. That\u2019s an interesting economic lever for us. For Savvy, we now have a great anchor in mobile. We\u2019re looking forward to figuring out how we can facilitate, like we\u2019re doing with Scopely, some partners in PC and console. GamesBeat: You\u2019re still looking around for opportunities? Ward: This year we haven\u2019t been looking at as many opportunities. We\u2019ve been focused internally on making sure we have the right leadership team in place. Scopely is a big acquisition. The integration is fairly involved. We\u2019re focused on making sure that we\u2019re putting some investment professionals in place, so we don\u2019t rely on external advisors as much. We\u2019re focused internally on our structure and governance and operating model, more so than looking for additional investments. GamesBeat: Were there some things that made you think that the period in which you were buying assets there \u2013 was that fortuitous in some ways? When there are downturns in the economy, prices for acquisitions are lower. It\u2019s a good time to buy. Did that matter to you? If you have strategic imperatives to move into a business fast, you probably don\u2019t care as much about the economic situation. Ward: That\u2019s true. It\u2019s very difficult to time the market. It\u2019s been fortuitous that valuations have come off a bit and those people with capital to employ have been in a market where it\u2019s been more difficult for people to find as many varied sources of capital as there were two years ago. That\u2019s advantageous to us. But we haven\u2019t pulled on that lever very hard. This year we\u2019ve been focused more internally. GamesBeat: For games it seems like there was a lot of pressure on valuations, after some very big excitement in 2021. Everybody thought that usage was going to go up forever. Is there a level-setting that you see that still reflects favorable trends? Ward: Overall, I think the trends are super favorable for the long term. We don\u2019t get too excited about this year versus last year or 2022 versus COVID. Long term we think this is probably the best entertainment business to be in. Yes, there\u2019s some sort of reconciliation. Figuring out where usage and engagement will land after COVID. But that will settle. GamesBeat: I listened to Take-Two\u2019s earnings call. It was interesting to hear Strauss Zelnick answer a question about games and Hollywood, all the synergy happening right now. Someone asked why they aren\u2019t doing more of that. He said, \u201cWe came from movies. It was a very hard business. There were many failures.\u201d For years everyone saw that the big opportunity was in games, so why would they go back in a big way? Although he did say that they\u2019re working on a Borderlands movie and some other projects. They\u2019re participating in that. But he felt like it was a no-brainer that gaming is still the more interesting business. Ward: It\u2019s kind of the flip side of the trend from 20 years ago, where movies became games. Now it\u2019s games becoming movies. GamesBeat: Do you think about that as an opportunity as well? Ward: Not yet. We\u2019re not focused on that at the moment. I still view us as a startup. We have maybe a couple hundred people in Saudi Arabia and 4,000 worldwide. We still have a lot of things to do in terms of building a games business. We have a pretty good esports business. GamesBeat: Are you focused on building a larger local staff? Ward: Very much so. The studio, which is now renamed Steer Studios, has done a super job. They now have about 80 people on two or three mobile teams, and 80% of them are Saudis. We\u2019re highly focused and highly incentivized against building out the local ecosystem. GamesBeat: How does that mix in with the Scopely business? Is it alongside Scopely? Ward: Scopely is very interested in the MENA region and expanding beyond their traditional markets. We expect that they\u2019ll be looking at opportunities in MENA and Saudi specifically. GamesBeat: How do you look back after some years on the issues around human rights that people have had with Saudi Arabia, whether or not they want to do business there? How is that turning out? Ward: My standard answer to this, or part of my standard answer, is for folks to take the time to understand what\u2019s going on there and how far this social transformation and economic diversification project is coming in the last five years. A tremendous amount of progress has been made toward Vision 2030 and all of this transformation. It\u2019s exciting. We\u2019re super happy to be part of it, part of this long-term journey. GamesBeat: Is there some sense of mission attached to that connected to Savvy? Ward: This is what really attracted me to this position and got me to move to Riyadh. I understood a bit about Vision 2030 and the economic diversification, social transformation aspect. But once I saw, once I visited for the first time and saw what that meant on the ground, I could see that this is kind of like China 35 years ago. The pace of change is astonishing. It seemed to be a unique opportunity to take part in something worthwhile. That\u2019s why I went there, and I think a lot of the people we\u2019ve hired and who have moved there are inspired by the same opportunity. GamesBeat: The flow of money into games, do you have any general observations about that? Is there some history to that flow? I just remember that when I joined VentureBeat 15 years ago, I thought I would stop covering games. There was a focus on venture capital for (tech), and there was (virtually) no venture capital for games. I thought I\u2019d end up covering tech more than games. But here we are 15 years later and GamesBeat is very big. Ward: You would know far more about this, but the level of engagement and the fan base and reach now of games, for those of us who\u2019ve been doing this almost 30 years \u2013 I remember thinking, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if we were eventually bigger than the music industry?\u201d Now we\u2019re bigger than those guys and the movies and somebody else put together. When you think about 3.2 billion people on the planet playing games on a regular basis, it\u2019s astonishing. GamesBeat: Saudi Arabia is also into building new cities and new structures. Do you have some sort of dream for that? How would building cities with games in mind happen? Ward: As you know, Vision 2030 encompasses all of those things. The giga-projects at NEOM and Qiddiya, which have significant \u2013 I mean, Qiddiya is essentially an entertainment-based city being built just west of Riyadh. We have a big part to play in the game section of that city. NEOM has a big games component to it as well. All these things are tied together under not only Vision 2030, but the national strategy for games and esports. Saudi, to my knowledge, is the only country on the planet that\u2019s announced a national strategy backed by the government for our sector. All of these things are interconnected in some pretty major ways. GamesBeat: The one hiccup that we\u2019ve seen lately is whether or not you were going to do the investment in Embracer. I don\u2019t know how you would signal to the rest of the market what that means. That particular deal is one that maybe wasn\u2019t going to happen. Is there any change in strategy? Ward: We don\u2019t have a change in our strategy. Our strategy has been consistent for the last two years. When we made our initial significant investment in Embracer, we had great faith in the leadership and the long-term strategic vision for Embracer. That hasn\u2019t changed either. We\u2019re very happy with our investment in Embracer over the long term. GamesBeat: The interest in doing large deals, is that still part of what you want? Ward: I think Scopely is the sixth-largest M&A deal in our industry\u2019s history. We\u2019re still interested, and we\u2019ve deployed maybe 25% of the capital designed to be allocated to us over the long term. We still have a significant part of our mandate to fulfill. GamesBeat: Do you have an interest in making sure you\u2019re not perceived as investing at valuations that are too high, or throwing too much money at your targets? Ward: We employ a lot of excellent and well-paid advisors to give us good opinions on these things. We trust the advice they give us. We think we\u2019ve done deals that have been very beneficial to Saudi and fair to both parties. If we looked at the transaction value on Scopely today we\u2019d be very pleased with how that\u2019s working out, given our mission. It\u2019s long term. People probably thought Amazon paying a billion dollars for Twitch was crazy at the time. GamesBeat: The good old days, when prices were low. For women in Saudi Arabia, do you feel like there are real opportunities for change for them? Ward: This is the thing that surprised me. I didn\u2019t have any personal knowledge or experience of the region. To see firsthand what was going on there in relation to opportunities for women, just generally speaking, was a real eye-opener. In a studio, which has nearly 80 people so far \u2013 this is a development studio. Almost 30% of that workforce are women. At any studio anywhere in the world that would be a pretty remarkable number. There\u2019s an equally high percentage of women in the Saudi workforce generally. It\u2019s exciting. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019m really happy about. When the Scopely guys came to visit, around the time of the closing, or just prior to the closing, we had a lunch for Scopely leadership and all of the local women employees in Saudi. The Scopely folks said they were blown away by the level of energy, enthusiasm, knowledge, and professionalism in that group. One of them said he wished he could bottle up that energy and take it back to California. GamesBeat: U.S. money has been going all over the world for decades. I suppose you could put an interpretation on that money. When China was also in the position of being able to finance a lot of the world, I think people wondered if they have a philosophy that also gets exported along with those investments in all those companies. Do they run these companies in a Chinese way? What is your own view as far as the next entity that really has the opportunity to invest all over the world? Is there a philosophy you\u2019d like to export, but also maybe one that stays at home in Saudi Arabia as well? Ward: There isn\u2019t a philosophy, other than we\u2019ve always intended to be and have been consistent in communicating this \u2013 we\u2019ve been given carte blanche to operate like a true games company, consistent with the values of our industry, what people consider to be important. That\u2019s been true. That was one thing I was pretty alive to when I first thought about the opportunity, because to your point, Chinese companies tend to operate \u2013 not all of them, but they tend to operate in a Chinese way. Western companies operate in a western way. But I can\u2019t say there\u2019s any defining set of values around being a Saudi games company. We\u2019re just trying to be a games company, period. GamesBeat: One interesting data point, maybe, that I was thinking about now. I wrote a profile on this guy named Amir Satvat who works for Amazon. He\u2019s kind of a quant. During the big layoffs that started happening in the fall, he started scraping all the game industry sites for job openings. He aggregated them into a spreadsheet on LinkedIn and made it available for everyone to look at. Here\u2019s all the jobs. He came up with 732 companies and 14,000 jobs that are open. The fun part was that he\u2019s noticed that for the last six weeks or so, that number has been steady. He sees that as a stabilization happening over a relatively short amount of time. Before that openings were tending to go down. Does that mean anything to you, that the collective number of jobs in the game industry is starting to go back up? Ward: I\u2019m not an expert by any stretch. I would anticipate that most of the post-COVID reconciliation of how many users there are, the engagement level and so forth has sorted itself out in terms of how many people we need to meet demand. We should start to be back to business as usual. That\u2019s what I would expect. GamesBeat: There\u2019s AI as well. Nobody knows what that\u2019s going to mean. I talked to a professor a few weeks ago who was saying that we could have a 10% boost to world GDP by 2032 with all the AI advances happening now. That\u2019s $11 trillion. That\u2019s happening. He thinks there\u2019s going to be more change in the next 10 years from AI than in the last 150 years of industrial revolution. One of his guys looked at a typical 2,000-person enterprise and found that jobs in that enterprise would probably be done with one-third to two-thirds fewer people. All these things seem to suggest we\u2019re about to be in another time of change. We thought there was change already in the last few decades, but there\u2019s more coming. Ward: But isn\u2019t that one of the best things about our industry, the constant change and development and evolution of it? I think AI is going to add a lot of jobs. There will be shifting in who does what. Did we need less artists when SpeedTree was introduced? No, we needed more. More tools mean more stuff gets done. That\u2019s the way I view it.

The post The 3 Best Transportation Stocks to Buy Now: September 2023 appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "content": "Transportation is a classic contender in the investment realm that often goes unnoticed. It might not have the glitz of newer sectors, but it stitches together over 5% of the U.S. GDP, translating to $1.3 trillion annually . For savvy investors, the search for the best transportation stocks begins here, blending tradition with tremendous potential. Moreover, even in the face of economic drizzles, some transportation companies sail smoothly, showing us their tenacity. While the broader stock market might occasionally catch a cold, those in the know are spotting golden opportunities. Among those are transportation stocks with rock-solid foundations. Furthermore, shopping sprees are set for a comeback as consumers\u2019 wanderlust for experiences settles down. For savvy investors, this hints at transportation giants focused on the movement of goods, especially those with tempting valuations. So, buckle up as we journey through three transportation stocks poised for a rewarding ride. Uber ( UBER ) Uber (NYSE: UBER ) has revved up to become the poster child of disruptive innovation. Displacing traditional taxis and pioneering the ride-sharing movement, Uber has effectively reshaped the dynamics of city transportation. But Uber didn\u2019t just stop at dropping you off at your destinations. Their progressive business plan brings food to your doorstep with Uber Eats. To go a mile further, they have revamped logistics with Uber Freight and Uber Business. The recent financial figures only underscore its relentless drive forward. Though its Q2 revenue of $9.23 billion narrowly missed projections, its net income of $394 million (or 18 cents per share) stole the show. In contrast was a staggering loss of $2.6 billion for the same quarter. It reported its first-ever quarterly operating profit of $326 million, along with a roaring free cash flow growth to $1.14 billion. This represents a near 200% bump from the prior year. Now, while it may not be rubbing shoulders with the elites in the S&P 500 just yet, the winds suggest it\u2019s prepping its grand entrance. Given its solid performances, it\u2019s undeniably one of the season\u2019s most unexpected yet delightful surprises. Canadian National Railway ( CNI ) Canadian National Railway (NYSE: CNI ) stands out as a robust pillar in the North American railroad landscape, bridging key territories across Canada and the midwestern U.S. Over the past decade, it has proven to be an excellent wealth compounder, delighting shareholders with a substantial 126% bump in its share price. It recently posted mixed earnings in its second-quarter, locking revenues at 4.06 billion CAD and grappling with an 8% drop in earnings-per-share compared to the prior year. However, the quarter was marred by a confluence of Canadian wildfires and economic ripples, viewed as transient clouds on CNI\u2019s horizon. Nevertheless, it still posted a budding 10% uptick in free cash flow, a testament to the company\u2019s resiliency. As we shift our gaze to the future, CNI holds a buoyant vision, forecasting potent growth between 10% to 15% in long-term earnings per share. Moreover, it promises 14.4% upside and a comforting 2.07% dividend yield. Boeing Co. ( BA ) Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA ), a titan in aerospace, is soaring to new heights. The aviation behemoth is renowned for its cutting-edge commercial jets and formidable defense systems. It posted an impressive Q2 revenue of $19.75 billion, eclipsing the projected $18.57 billion. This uptick can be credited to various factors, chiefly the resurgence in passenger traffic across the U.S., Europe, and Asia in the post-pandemic era. Furthermore, despite the headwinds stemming from supply chain hiccups and the recent blip around the Boeing 737 MAX, the company\u2019s trajectory remains skyward. A testament to this is the 12% jump in deliveries and a healthy 41% surge in revenues during its second-quarter. Pivoting to China, recent developments have bolstered Boeing\u2019s standing, marking a rebound from earlier setbacks. Given these indicators, Boeing\u2019s flight path looks set on a promising horizon.

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Job seekers in 2008-09 recession. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) Getty Images The next recession will not be a disaster. I expect a recession to begin early in 2024, or possibly late this year, and that frightens many people. But recessions do not hurt most people, though they certainly can be very harmful to some. Employment in Recessions Unemployment rises during recessions, but not as much as we seem to fear. In the recessions between 1948 and 2019, the unemployment rate during the downturns was 1.4 percentage point higher than in the 12 months preceding the recession. The average time spent unemployed increased by less than one week during recessions. Working hours are cut in recessions, but by only 24 minutes a week on average. (The Data Note at the end of this article explains the methodology behind the numbers in this article.) Definition of Recession In assessing the data, we must remember that economists define a recession as the period when economic activity is declining. Once the decline is over and the economy turns up a little, we say the recession is over even though we have not yet recovered all of the lost ground. For some variables, the data often look their worst just after the recession has technically ended. Home Prices in Recession The median and average selling prices of homes usually rise in recession. That\u2019s surprising given what happened in 2008-09, when prices fell six percent by our comparison of the recession average to the 12 prior months. From the peak for prices (which occurred a year before the recession began), to the trough (two years after the recession ended), the decline was a whopping 19%. Recessions are not good for home prices. But prices usually rise over the long haul. Recessions typically slow the rise without turning prices downward. Of the ten recessions for which we have data (not counting 2020), only one shows a clear decline in prices. Eight recessions had home price increases, with the 1990 recession ambiguous.

Keep in mind that delinquent means at least 30 days late. Most delinquencies do not result in foreclosure. Banks write off more consumer loans in recession, but by less than one percentage point. Commercial real estate is even safer, with charge-offs increasing by only 0.6 percentage points. Business non-real estate lending charge-offs rise by a similar amount. Most Recession Effects Temporary In the typical economic model, the effects of a recession are temporary because the economy bounces back with above-normal growth rates, regaining its trend line. There have been some studies finding long-lasting impacts on those people who tried to find their first jobs during a recession and on people who were laid off in a recession. These studies are suggestive rather than definitive given data limitations. The most cited study found the impacts lasted seven to ten years but were not permanent. 2008-09 Recession Was Unusually Bad Today\u2019s fear of recession probably derives from the 2008-09 experience, which was especially harsh. In terms of overall impact on gross domestic product, that recession was twice as bad as the average recession preceding it. GDP declines in recessions. Dr. Bill Conerly based on data from U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis The chart shows substantial variation from one recession to another. For other variables, such as the average duration of unemployment, the range is comparably large. The largest recession increase was 2.2 weeks; the smallest 0.2 weeks. That illustrates that each recession is unique. The underly economy evolves over time, making the likely effects of a recession in the 2020s different from the 1950s. In addition, each recession occurs with unique external influences, such as world oil prices. Policy responses to recession also vary from case to case. As a result, we should not expect any particular downturn to mirror a past recession. But the past does give us an idea of the likely range of possibilities. Data Note: Recessions are defined by the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private non-profit organization. I do not include the 2020 recession in these calculations because it was atypical, being just two months in duration but very severe in magnitude. Some of the data series are not available back to 1948, so their averages were calculated over shorter time periods. Comparison of recessions with the 12 months preceding the recession is done because of drift over time in unemployment and other variables. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn . Check out my website .

Modi has painted the summit as India's diplomatic coming of age and is pushing for his country -- which wants a permanent seat on the UN Security Council -- to be seen as a voice of the Global South. At full strength the African Union has 55 members, but six junta-ruled nations are currently suspended. Collectively it has a GDP of $3 trillion with some 1.4 billion people. As the G20, the grouping included 19 countries and the European Union, representing 85 percent of the world GDP, with South Africa its only member state from the continent. It was conceived in the throes of the 2008 financial crisis as a way of managing the global economy, but finding consensus among members has been increasingly difficult in recent years. The AU membership could be among the most tangible outcomes from the summit itself, with Modi trying to forge consensus on a host of contentious issues, and key G20 members deeply divided over Russia's war in Ukraine and how to pay for climate change. On the summit sidelines, G20 partners will unveil ambitious plans Saturday to bolster trade between India, the Middle East and Europe, the United States said. It is a modern-day Spice Route that could more closely bind three regions that account for about a third of the global economy -- and represent an alternative to China's vast investment in global infrastructure. Washington, Saudi Arabia, the EU, UAE and others will sign an agreement on the sidelines of the G20 summit to explore a railway and port project to augment trade flows between Europe and India, officials said. The agreement comes with Washington actively engaging with Riyadh, a major oil producer and security partner, as it encourages the kingdom to normalise ties with Israel. Jon Finer, US deputy national security advisor, said the announcement came after \"months of careful diplomacy, quiet, careful diplomacy, bilaterally and in multilateral settings\". This project \"has enormous potential\" he said. \"But exactly how long it takes, I don't know\". The project is still in the early stages, with participants studying how best to link India's vast 1.4 billion population and quick-growing economy with markets to the west. But Michael Kugelman, South Asia Institute director at The Wilson Center, said the plan could be a significant response to China's much-vaunted Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) -- which has spread Chinese influence, investments and commerce across Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America. \"If finalised, it would be a game changer that strengthens connectivity between India and the Middle East and would aim to counter BRI,\" Kugelman posted on X, formerly known as Twitter . The plans will include data, rail, electricity and hydrogen pipeline links, EU officials told AFP. Chinese leader Xi Jinping himself is skipping the summit, sending his number two, Premier Li Qiang, to India instead in a move that called into question the meeting's importance. No official reason was given for Xi's absence, but the Asian giants have been at loggerheads over a border dispute and other issues, while Beijing is seeking to make US-led groupings such as the G20 more amenable to its own interests. Russia's seat is taken by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, with diplomatic opprobrium and war crimes charges keeping the country's leader Vladimir Putin from the summit. United Nations chief Antonio Guterres warned Friday of growing global divisions, insisting countries must assume responsibility regardless of \"whether it's the president or the prime minister or the vice president\" who is in New Delhi. The backdrop to the talks could hardly be starker: the European Union's climate monitor has said this year is likely to be the hottest in human history, with Guterres declaring on Friday the \"climate crisis is spiralling out of control\". G20 countries account for around 85 percent of global climate warming emissions, making action in the forum crucial to real progress. G20 \u00a9 Copyright IBTimes 2023. All rights reserved.

Divided over Russia's war in Ukraine and gridlocked on finding agreement to slash carbon emissions, the summit's most tangible outcome could be the expected accession of the African Union to the grouping that represents 85 percent of global GDP. The Group of 20 was conceived in the throes of the 2008 financial crisis as a way of managing the global economy. But finding consensus among members has been increasingly difficult in recent years. Even before it began, the importance of the New Delhi summit was called into question when China's Xi Jinping decided to skip the meeting and send his number two, Premier Li Qiang, to India instead.

G20 countries account for around 85 percent of global climate warming emissions, making action in the forum crucial to real progress. India's Modi has painted the summit as his country's diplomatic coming of age -- evidence of New Delhi's clout and prestige on the global stage. While spoilers may yet stop the bid, Modi does look set to secure one notable diplomatic victory, with several leaders expressing support for expanding the bloc into the \"G21\" by including the African Union as a permanent member. The move would help burnish Modi's image as a self-styled leader of the \"Global South\", a bridge between developed and developing countries. Modi argues developing nations need a greater say in global decision-making, and an invitation for the 55-member AU to join could come as soon as Saturday. South Africa is currently the only G20 member from the continent. But on Ukraine there was little sign of progress. Moscow continues to press its allies to water down international condemnation of its invasion of Ukraine, throwing up a major roadblock to joint action. Ahead of his arrival in New Delhi on Friday, US President Joe Biden insisted that the G20 can still \"deliver\", even as markets fret that a trade war between the world's two largest economies -- the United States and China -- is poised to escalate. Many G20 leaders fear their countries are already at risk of becoming collateral damage as the big beasts of world trade lock horns. Washington has restricted US technology transfers to the world's second-largest economy and rumours have swirled that Beijing may be about to ban Apple's ubiquitous iPhone -- most of which are made in China. China was overtaken as the world's most populous country by India this year and growth is slowing, with economists pointing to structural problems such as a shrinking labour force, slower productivity and an overheated real estate market.

The post Highlights From This Week\u2019s Fed Speakers appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "content": "The next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting might not be for another couple weeks, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the Fed has been sitting on its laurels ahead of the meeting. On Wednesday, the Fed released its Beige Book survey in preparation for its September FOMC meeting. The good news is the Beige Book survey acknowledged that inflation pressures are abating, and that job growth is slowing. Almost all of the Fed\u2019s 12 districts indicated that businesses \u201crenewed their previously unfulfilled expectations that wage growth will slow broadly in the near term.\u201d The only inflation warning was a comment saying that \u201ccontacts in several districts highlighted sharp increases in property insurance costs during the past few months.\u201d So apparently the insurance companies fleeing California, Florida and other high-risk areas may be hindering some housing markets. Several Fed members also spoke throughout the week, offering their insights on the economy and the current state of inflation. So, in today\u2019s Market 360 , let\u2019s review the comments four Fed officials made about inflation and interest rates. We\u2019ll consider what this means for the next FOMC meeting, and then I\u2019ll share how to build your portfolio while we wait on the Fed. Comments From Four Fed Officials Boston Fed President Susan Collins : She expects that the economy will start to weaken as we round out the year \u2013 and stay weak throughout 2024. Although recent U.S. economic data has shown that the economy is accelerating (the Atlanta Fed expects GDP growth of 5.6% in the third quarter), Collins believes there are underlying issues. She said that people\u2019s pandemic savings are dwindling and spending will become more sensitive to interest. She also believes that \u201can orderly slowdown\u201d can bring inflation toward price stability. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee : He clarified his stance that the economy can get on a \u201cgolden path\u201d to getting inflation down while avoiding a recession. He believes that it\u2019s a possibility, though not a guarantee. He noted that he wants to see inflation in goods and housing slow, but believes monetary policy is working. He said: \u201cWe are very rapidly approaching the time when our argument is not going to be about how high should the rates go; it\u2019s going to be an argument about how long do we need to keep the rates at this position.\u201d New York Fed President John Williams: He said he expects the current unemployment rate of 3.8% to rise to the low 4% range \u2013 but doesn\u2019t expect joblessness to reach levels of past recessions. On the topic of inflation, he declined to say whether he believes the Fed should raise rates again. He said, \u201cThings are moving in the right direction and we\u2019ve got policy in a good place, but we\u2019re going to need to continue to be data dependent, watch developments and assess what we need to do.\u201d He also said that \u201call that talk about we\u2019re about to have a recession has vanished.\u201d Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan : \u201cAnother skip could be appropriate when we meet later this month\u2026 But skipping does not imply stopping. In the coming months, further evaluation of the data and outlook could confirm that we need to do more to extinguish inflation.\u201d The bottom line : Based on their comments, it seems that the Fed is leaning towards not raising key interest rates at its next FOMC meeting. Personally, I don\u2019t expect the Fed to hike key interest rates, especially given that the Beige Book cited slowing economic growth in July and August. The majority of the market agrees, as analysts now believe there\u2019s a 93% chance that the Fed does not raise key interest rates in September. I should also add that the Fed could even start cutting rates as early as December. The annual core rate of inflation should be under 2% later this year, which could be the final push our central bank needs to cut rates.

There is a great divide opening up in America \u2013 and investing in my Growth Investor stocks will help get you on the right side of it. On one side is a new aristocracy that\u2019s amassing more wealth more quickly than any other group in American history. For people like me, the one percent , life has never been better, more prosperous. On the other side, the opposite is happening. Wealth is flowing out of the pockets of ordinary Americans at an unprecedented rate. What\u2019s happening is only going to gather in strength over the coming decades. It certainly won\u2019t weaken. Few Americans even know that any of this is going on. I\u2019ve never seen anyone from my side of the chasm step forward to explain any of these things . It\u2019s why I put together this video . In it, I\u2019ll lay out exactly what is happening, including several key steps every American should take right now.", "pubDate": "2023-09-08 20:30:12", "image_url": null, "source_id": "investorplace", "source_priority": 3707, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["business"], "language": "english"}], "nextPage": "1694205012078669288"}
