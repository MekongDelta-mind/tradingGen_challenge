Josh Green. Nonessential travel to much of the island's western coastline has been strongly discouraged since devastating wildfires killed at least 115 people in the historic town of Lahaina last month. State tourism officials initially urged travelers to stay away from Maui so residents and agencies could focus on emergency response efforts and supporting those displaced by the fires. In mid-August, officials began encouraging tourists to return to other parts of Maui, avoiding the burn zone and spending money to help the region recover. On Thursday, Green told a meeting of the state Council on Revenues that he expected authorities to reopen most of West Maui to travelers in October, with the exception of the fire-damaged neighborhoods. The area, which includes beach resorts in Kaanapali, north of historic Lahaina, has 11,000 hotel rooms. That\u2019s half Maui\u2019s total. In the emergency proclamation signed Friday, the governor said the previous guidance that strongly discouraged nonessential travel to West Maui will be discontinued Oct. 8. Tourism is a major economic driver in , and the wildfire disaster prompted state officials to lower their 2023 economic growth prediction for the entire state to 1.1%, down from 1.8%.

The cornerstone of this regulatory framework is the requirement for cryptocurrency-related entities to obtain licenses to operate legally within the country.

The post Is C3.ai Ready for Lift-Off? Key Factors to Watch for AI Stock. appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "content": "Last week, I mentioned in my article how C3.ai (NYSE: AI ) is a significant player in AI, but its high valuation draws investor scrutiny despite its potential. This is a company that\u2019s certainly polarizing, and for good reason. As far as companies viewed as battlegrounds in the artificial intelligence discussion, AI stock certainly makes the list (and for more reasons than just its ticker). Accordingly, with so much attention being paid to this artificial intelligence and automation play, let\u2019s dive into what investors may want to keep in mind as potential catalysts or headwinds on the horizon. Here are a few things I\u2019m keeping an eye on right now investors may want to watch. Recent Earnings Report C3 AI CEO Thomas M. Siebel expressed the growing global interest in enterprise AI adoption and strong traction with C3 Generative AI. C3.ai\u2019s Q1 earnings exceeded expectations, but revenue fell short of Wall Street estimates, and the revenue outlook for AI stock was also lower than expected. In the July quarter, the company reported an adjusted loss of 9 cents per share compared to a 12-cent loss the previous year, with revenue increasing by 11% to $72.36 million. C3.ai\u2019s Q1 results beat estimates with a loss of 9 cents per share and $72.36 million in revenue. However, its Q2 outlook fell short of expectations, leading AI stock to drop 4.2% to $30.15 in after-hours trading. Analysts had predicted a 17-cent loss and $73.8 million in revenue, while the company\u2019s guidance is for a 12-cent loss and revenue of $72-76.5 million. I\u2019m going to be keeping a close eye on how guidance improves (or not) in upcoming earnings reports. C3.ai Fundamentals As an AI industry pioneer, the firm, though recent losses, anticipates profitability by 2025 . With management holding 26%, alignment with investors is clear. The stock is rebounding from a deep 2021-2022 bear market, bottoming at $10/share in December 2022 and now trading at $31/share in a volatile 2023. Bulls hope for an earnings-driven breakout, while bears expect a gap down and decline. During earnings season, what matters most to me is how the market and a company respond to the news. Remember, limit losses and don\u2019t go against market trends. C3.ai\u2019s stock surged in 2023 due to excitement around OpenAI and generative AI. The company expects revenue to grow as AI pilot projects expand, making it a notable AI stock with a strong Relative Strength Rating of 97. C3.ai went public in December 2020, raising $651 million. The company specializes in AI applications for industries like energy, finance, and defense. It recently shifted its pricing model from subscription to consumption-based. This could lead to significant growth over the long-term, but also comes with some risks. Investors will need to watch how this shift affects the company\u2019s fundamentals and growth prospects moving forward. What Now C3.ai is undeniably pricey given its current growth rate, but this is likely to change as growth accelerates. Analysts project an impressive 51% annual earnings growth for the next five years. With a vast $791 billion market to tap into, C3.ai has the potential to achieve this. Investors open to a premium valuation for C3.ai\u2019s promising future may see opportunity in its recent dip. As growth speeds up, Wall Street\u2019s confidence is likely to increase, potentially driving long-term gains for this AI stock. That said, this company\u2019s valuation is a sticking point, making AI stock one I think investors can trade, but may have difficulty owning right now.

I track how technology innovations move markets and careers Following Sep 9, 2023, 12:09pm EDT | Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Toss-up: tech company or manufacturer? getty The US Census Bureau maintains a very meticulous list of industry categories, known as the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). This is recognized as the definitive guide to understanding who falls into which category \u2014 be it copper, nickel, lead, and zinc mining; or dog and cat food manufacturing; or sports and recreation instruction. But what happens when every company becomes a technology company? It may become more difficult to pigeonhole an organization into a single category. Large enterprises with substantial M&A budgets have been dabbling in diversification for decades. Remember when Sears got into banking? Or Exxon\u2019s foray into office information systems? Now, with the advent of technology and disrupted business models, facilitating well-connected ecosystems of partners and innovators, many companies are jumping across NAICS classifications not only into adjacent industries, but outside their core sectors all together. For example, manufacturers are increasingly building up capacity as maintenance services providers \u2014 what\u2019s referred to as servitization. \u201cEntire industries are moving from traditional customer interactions to connected, long-term customer relationships,\u201d a report from Accenture illustrates. For example, with intelligent sensors within the units they install, elevator manufacturers now provide ongoing, 24x7 service along with preventative maintenance service to building and facilities operators, There\u2019s another twist. A majority of equipment manufacturers, 76%, either currently offer or plan to offer Equipment-as-a-Service options for customers, a survey released in August 2022 by Relayr finds. Within this model, an original equipment manufacturer rents equipment to end users, versus one-time purchases. Then there is the emerging Manufacturing as a Service model, based on a \u201cmachine economy,\u201d as described in a recent report out of the Industry IoT Consortium. This economy is being built upon \u201ca network of smart, connected, and economically independent devices and machines acting as autonomous market participants, executing economic transactions and other activities with little to no human intervention.\u201d MORE FOR YOU Apple Leak Details All-New iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro Price Changes Apple Loop iPhone 15 Pro Launch Dates Confirmed iPhone 15 Delays Apple s Expensive China Problem Android Circuit Google Confirms Pixel 8 Microsoft Remembers Surface Duo Honor Magic V2 Wins IFA Manufacturers aren\u2019t the only types of companies expanding their realms through technology. For example, \"there is crossover between healthcare and technology in telemedicine,\" says Joe Collura , vice president of solution engineering at SS&C Blue Prism. \"The energy and environmental industries cross over in delivering renewable energy solutions such as solar, wind and hydropower.\" Two adjacent industries \u2014 banks and insurance \u2014 are increasingly blending their offerings within applications and mobile apps, a survey of 200 global financial services executives from Chubb finds. An example would be shipping insurance offered with online product purchases. At this time, a majority of financial executives report that up to 10% of their revenues come from insurance \u2014 a level that is expected to double over the next three years. \u201cA convergence between banking, insurance and wealth management has resulted in consumers having an average of 6.3 financial products, but only half of which are from their main bank,\u201d confirms Muqsit Ashraf , strategy lead for Accenture. \"The boundaries between industries are increasingly blurring with extending value chains that can unlock value opportunities through new products and services.\u201d The hybridization of industry groups is now seen across the spectrum. \u201cWe operate across 19 industries at Accenture and often help our clients cross into adjacent industries,\u201d says Ashraf. \u201cThere has been a sharp rise in ecosystem deals \u2013 where acquirers look to gain access to assets from outside of their core businesses.\u201d Perhaps the most striking example of cross-industry pollination is the widespread evolution for many companies into technology companies. \"Industry hybridization has become more pervasive as technology continues to advance and industries overlap in unprecedented ways,\" says Collura. \"Regardless of the industry, almost every company has transformed into a technology company, as it is now essential to provide seamless customer service and solutions powered by artificial intelligence and robotic process automation.\" Both \u201cphysical and digital technologies are accelerating this trend,\u201d says Ashraf. \u201cOn the digital side, technologies like generative AI are fundamentally changing the ways we work across industries. AI will enable gains in customer experience, productivity, capital efficiency and business resilience. In other instances, it will introduce new business models and ways of collaborating that can increase crossover in industries.\u201d With increased industry hybridization come many unknowns that need to be understood. \u201cThese unknowns are around technology, market potential, customer appetite, and business and operating models,\u201d Ashraf cautions. Regulatory and legal challenges are also a potential issue. \u201cDifferent industries may have distinct regulations, standards and compliance requirements,\u201d says Collura. \u201cPrivacy and security concerns come to mind as the integration of technologies from different industries can increase the potential for data breaches, cyberattacks and privacy violations.\u201d Communication and collaboration across and beyond industries is essential. \u201cThe ecosystem can come together to offer new products and services underpinned by innovative business and commercial models,\u201d says Ashraf. \u201cWhen companies are deciding whether to build, buy or partner to secure capabilities they need for growth, M&A and partnering jump to the top of the list \u2013 along with joint ventures, equity investments and other financing vehicles.\u201d Partnerships, M&A and organic growth \"all play a role in the evolution of businesses,\" Collura agrees. \"Technological advances and rapidly changing consumer demand are equally responsible for driving further hybridization. These factors go hand-in-hand as the unprecedented amount of venture capital in recent years has enabled more startups, acquisition and opportunities for synergy between companies.\" Follow me on Twitter .

The post META Stock Outlook: 3 Catalysts That Could Fuel Meta Platform\u2019s Next Rally appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) had a turbulent 2022, plunging from a high of roughly $380 per share to the $88 level, and then more than tripling in early 2023. At around $300 per share at the time of writing, META stock has certainly become one of the come back stories investors like to see. Those who have held this stock through the turbulence are none the worse for the wear, especially if those same investors bought the stock years ago. Of course, n ews often mirrors stock performance, and it\u2019s crucial to remember the negative headlines about Meta during its decline. Now, optimism abounds for many large-cap tech stocks . That said, investors must consider whether it\u2019s overvalued or rightfully bullish after its roughly 10% decline from its recent peak. Here are three catalysts I think are worth watching when it comes to Meta right now. Meta Platforms is Being Re-Rated Higher Among 42 analysts , 40 rate Mets Platforms stock as \u201cbuy,\u201d with none issuing a recent \u201csell\u201d rating, despite its August decline. Analysts, like Scott Devitt from Wedbush, see potential in Meta\u2019s job cuts leading to improved margins. Devitt notes enhanced monetization in newer areas like Reels and click-to-message ads, setting a $350 price target for META stock. Similarly, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) analysts, with a $375 price target, anticipate renewed enthusiasm for Meta\u2019s stock in 2024 once spending targets are clearer. As more analysts jump on Meta Platforms as a potential long-term opportunity, I expect more price target hikes and upgrades on the horizon. Strong Fundamentals Meta stands out in the tech sector with just 21.6% of its capitalization comprised of debt, a modest figure compared to other tech firms. Meta\u2019s free cash flow, around $24 billion this year , surpasses its total debt of approximately $37 billion, a rarity in the corporate world. This robust cash flow has allowed Meta to repurchase 101 million of its own shares in the past year, benefiting shareholders and boosting stock prices. Meta\u2019s return on invested capital (or ROIC) historically ranged from 15% to 20%, ensuring that the money used for stock buybacks generates similar returns for shareholders. While criticism exists for Meta\u2019s investment in the metaverse, which has yet to yield expected profits, it has lowered ROIC to 14%, still strong compared to many companies. Meta\u2019s robust fundamentals extend to its market share, with Facebook commanding 53.1% of all social media visits (excluding Instagram). This significant presence offers multiple avenues for monetization, irrespective of the metaverse\u2019s success. AI Is The Main Near-Term Catalyst Meta Platforms understands the need for substantial investments in specific areas. It\u2019s a manageable challenge as long as the company can maintain strong revenue growth. While Q2 2023 showed an 11% year-over-year revenue increase, the focus now shifts to what will drive revenue growth in the latter half of 2023 and 2024. Meta Platforms is said to be working on an AI bot for enhancing business customer service and an internal AI tool designed to boost staff productivity. Of course, given the attention around artificial intelligence of late, this has garnered some attention. That said, over the longer-term, we\u2019ll have to see how this actually impacts the company\u2019s bottom line (if it\u2019s more or less like Meta\u2019s move into the metaverse, for example). What Now for Meta Platforms? While Meta shifts its focus to Threads and monetizing Instagram/WhatsApp, the metaverse project might lose some prominence. However, analysts expect double-digit earnings per share growth (around 26.7%) over the next twelve months, which could propel the stock higher, given the historical link between EPS and stock prices. Consider the potential if they redirect metaverse spending is redirected elsewhere, possibly restoring ROIC to its historical levels. This could result in more substantial share buybacks and higher analyst targets due to improved monetization and ROIC. Investors should seize this opportunity. On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a LONG position in META.

The IPO venue may seem surprising, but not when you consider the Duluth, Minnesota-based company's atypical ownership: the Chinese government. The state-owned Chinese company that took control of Cirrus in 2011 has presided over a period of stability, including the successful launch of a new jet business. However, the company, aerospace giant AVIC, is on a U.S. government investment sanctions list aimed at companies linked to China's military. Two AVIC-controlled companies related to Cirrus are on a separate U.S. export control list due to their Chinese military association. Heightened tensions between China and the U.S. have so far had \"minimal\" impact on Cirrus, the company noted in its IPO filing. Still, it said an \"escalation in geopolitical tension ... could lead to a material adverse effect on our business.\" It's questionable whether a Chinese buyout of Cirrus would even be approved nowadays given the increasingly tense relations between the United States and China, analysts said. \"If a similar deal was brought [forward] today, there would be a lot more political barriers,\" Charlie Vest, associate director at Rhodium Group, a New York-based research and company. \"These are very different times in the relationship between the U.S. and China and the political dynamics of Chinese investments in the U.S. have changed.\" AVIC would ultimately still control Cirrus after the IPO, which aims to sell up to 20% of the company and raise roughly $200 million to $400 million. However, Zean Nielsen, the company's CEO, said Cirrus is operationally independent of its shareholders. He called Chinese government ownership \"just one of those things that just is. It doesn't really change how I run the company.\" \"My job is to take care of customers and employees the best I know how,\" he said. Cirrus readily complies with federal rules on Chinese investment in the U.S., he said. \"All the things we need to disclose, we happily do.\" Cirrus has been on a hot streak since Nielsen, a former Tesla executive, became CEO in 2019. The company's revenue grew from $586 million in 2020 to $894 million last year, while its profits more than doubled, according to its June IPO filing. Cirrus has a backlog of over 1,400 aircraft, which will keep its Duluth manufacturing plant busy. Cirrus' success has been good for Duluth. It's one of the city's largest employers with 1,588 workers \u2014 the majority in manufacturing and engineering. This month, the company expects to complete a new $20 million innovation center at its Duluth International Airport campus, freeing up about 75,000 square feet for manufacturing. Proceeds from the IPO will be used to further bolster manufacturing; expand Cirrus' growing services business; and invest in new technology, including more automation. \"We will continue to make flying a Cirrus easier and easier,\" Nielsen said. Cirrus is the leading U.S. maker of single-engine piston planes, and its SF Vision jet \u2014 launched in 2016 \u2014 has been a hit. The company has delivered 475 jets, including 90 in 2022, its best production year yet. Jets account for about 30 % of Cirrus' sales. \"They are playing to a niche where no one else plays,\" said Brian Foley, an aviation analyst. Cirrus essentially created a market for a single-engine jet. It's slower than a twin-engine jet, but its price point is considerably lower. The Cirrus jet goes for about $3.25 million, while the next cheapest jet in the market is a twin-engine Embraer model priced at $5 million, analysts say. AVIC's ultimate ownership was crucial in developing the jet, which had been on the drawing board since the 2000s. \"Without them, the SF50 probably wouldn't have happened,\" said Bruce McClelland, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group. \"Chinese investment got [Cirrus] over the hump to launch the aircraft.\" Indeed, Chinese investment rescued Cirrus. The aviation industry tanked after the 2008 global financial meltdown and Cirrus was in deep trouble. \"They simply ran out of money, and that is how China came into play,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst. AVIC's general aviation subsidiary paid $210 million for Cirrus and got the blessing of the U.S. Treasury Department's committee on foreign investment, which reviews deals for national security concerns. But in recent years, sentiment against Chinese investment in the United States has risen. Take the recent fate of a $700 million corn mill planned for Grand Forks, N.D. The mill proposed by Fufeng Group, a privately owned Chinese company, at first won state and local government support, hailed as an economic plum. But some local citizens began protesting the mill, including its Chinese ownership. In January, the U.S. Air Force weighed in, calling the project a national security threat; the mill would have been 12 miles from the Grand Forks Air Force Base. The Fufeng deal soon died. Ironically, Cirrus has a plant in Grand Forks that is only about 17 miles from the Grand Forks Air Force Base. It employs 494 people and makes components that are assembled into airplanes in Duluth. And Cirrus' main owner AVIC \u2014 unlike Fufeng \u2014 has been on the U.S. government's growing Chinese Military Industrial Complex (CMIC) blacklist since 2020. AVIC is a sprawling aerospace concern that supplies China's military, and some of its myriad subsidiaries have publicly traded stock. U.S. investors are restricted from investing in securities of companies on the CMIC list. But the investment restriction applies specifically to AVIC subsidiaries that are also on the CMIC list. The AVIC subsidiary that owns Cirrus \u2014 China General Aviation Industry General Aircraft (CAIGA) \u2014 isn't on the list. In other words, U.S. investors could buy Cirrus stock, the IPO filing said. AVIC owns 70% of CAIGA; the other 30% is held by three state-owned Chinese investment companies. Three other subsidiaries of CAIGA have been among Cirrus' top five customers for the past few years, and two of them \u2014 AG Huanan and AG Zhejiang \u2014 have been on the U.S. \"military end user\" (MEU) list since 2020, meaning they are subject to export controls. The list applies to military-connected companies in Russia, China, Venezuela and Burma. The three related companies accounted for less than 7% of Cirrus' sales during each of the last three years. Cirrus sells aircraft kits for a version of its SR20 plane to AG Huanan. It's developing a small prop plane \u2014 the AG100 \u2014 with AG Zhejiang for the China market. The plane is aimed at training green pilots. Cirrus has the proper U.S. export clearances for both of its Chinese customers on the MEU list, the company said in its IPO filing. The AG100 agreement with AG Zhejiang allows Cirrus to market a similar plane called the SR10 in the United States. But Cirrus doesn't have the incentive to do so right now, Nielsen said. Cirrus' prop planes are already used for training. China, on the other hand, has only a tiny civil aviation industry. Its airspace is restricted. The AG100 would be used by flight schools and is aimed at training commercial pilots, Nielsen said, and it's not intended for military use. Still, the AG 100 could conceivably be used for basic military training. After all, the U.S. Air Force uses Cirrus prop planes for training. \"If you are starting from the ground up \u2014 training military pilots \u2014 you do it in planes like this,\" said aviation industry analyst McClelland. However, analysts say it's generally hard to see military uses for Cirrus' products. Cirrus is far from the only U.S. aviation business that caught China's eye. Indeed, Aboulafia noted that before U.S.-Chinese tensions rose, several prominent U.S. aerospace companies entered joint ventures with Chinese companies \u2014 including with AVIC. \"They probably wouldn't be approved today, but no one wants to kill them now,\" Aboulafia said.", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 14:00:00", "image_url": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postguam.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/ac/3ac85994-4ebc-11ee-b5ad-13755b65d413/64fbef917e4fc.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200", "source_id": "postguam", "source_priority": 93374, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["business"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "1d2bda857d27e5b312134bd71656e1c8", "title": "The 3 Best Transportation Stocks to Buy Now: September 2023", "link": "https://investorplace.com/2023/09/the-3-best-transportation-stocks-to-buy-now-september-2023/", "keywords": ["Stocks to Buy", "NYSE:UBER", "NYSE:CNI", "NYSE:BA", "Stocks to Buy"], "creator": ["Muslim Farooque"], "video_url": null, "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips For savvy investors, this hints at transportation giants focused on the movement of goods, especially those with tempting valuations. The post The 3 Best Transportation Stocks to Buy Now: September 2023 appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "content": "Transportation is a classic contender in the investment realm that often goes unnoticed. It might not have the glitz of newer sectors, but it stitches together over 5% of the U.S. GDP, translating to $1.3 trillion annually . For savvy investors, the search for the best transportation stocks begins here, blending tradition with tremendous potential. Moreover, even in the face of economic drizzles, some transportation companies sail smoothly, showing us their tenacity. While the broader stock market might occasionally catch a cold, those in the know are spotting golden opportunities. Among those are transportation stocks with rock-solid foundations. Furthermore, shopping sprees are set for a comeback as consumers\u2019 wanderlust for experiences settles down. For savvy investors, this hints at transportation giants focused on the movement of goods, especially those with tempting valuations. So, buckle up as we journey through three transportation stocks poised for a rewarding ride. Uber ( UBER ) Uber (NYSE: UBER ) has revved up to become the poster child of disruptive innovation. Displacing traditional taxis and pioneering the ride-sharing movement, Uber has effectively reshaped the dynamics of city transportation. But Uber didn\u2019t just stop at dropping you off at your destinations. Their progressive business plan brings food to your doorstep with Uber Eats. To go a mile further, they have revamped logistics with Uber Freight and Uber Business. The recent financial figures only underscore its relentless drive forward. Though its Q2 revenue of $9.23 billion narrowly missed projections, its net income of $394 million (or 18 cents per share) stole the show. In contrast was a staggering loss of $2.6 billion for the same quarter. It reported its first-ever quarterly operating profit of $326 million, along with a roaring free cash flow growth to $1.14 billion. This represents a near 200% bump from the prior year. Now, while it may not be rubbing shoulders with the elites in the S&P 500 just yet, the winds suggest it\u2019s prepping its grand entrance. Given its solid performances, it\u2019s undeniably one of the season\u2019s most unexpected yet delightful surprises. Canadian National Railway ( CNI ) Canadian National Railway (NYSE: CNI ) stands out as a robust pillar in the North American railroad landscape, bridging key territories across Canada and the midwestern U.S. Over the past decade, it has proven to be an excellent wealth compounder, delighting shareholders with a substantial 126% bump in its share price. It recently posted mixed earnings in its second-quarter, locking revenues at 4.06 billion CAD and grappling with an 8% drop in earnings-per-share compared to the prior year. However, the quarter was marred by a confluence of Canadian wildfires and economic ripples, viewed as transient clouds on CNI\u2019s horizon. Nevertheless, it still posted a budding 10% uptick in free cash flow, a testament to the company\u2019s resiliency. As we shift our gaze to the future, CNI holds a buoyant vision, forecasting potent growth between 10% to 15% in long-term earnings per share. Moreover, it promises 14.4% upside and a comforting 2.07% dividend yield. Boeing Co. ( BA ) Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA ), a titan in aerospace, is soaring to new heights. The aviation behemoth is renowned for its cutting-edge commercial jets and formidable defense systems. It posted an impressive Q2 revenue of $19.75 billion, eclipsing the projected $18.57 billion. This uptick can be credited to various factors, chiefly the resurgence in passenger traffic across the U.S., Europe, and Asia in the post-pandemic era. Furthermore, despite the headwinds stemming from supply chain hiccups and the recent blip around the Boeing 737 MAX, the company\u2019s trajectory remains skyward. A testament to this is the 12% jump in deliveries and a healthy 41% surge in revenues during its second-quarter. Pivoting to China, recent developments have bolstered Boeing\u2019s standing, marking a rebound from earlier setbacks. Given these indicators, Boeing\u2019s flight path looks set on a promising horizon.
