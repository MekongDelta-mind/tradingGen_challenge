(Sep)NOTE: Previews are listed in day orderNORWEGIAN CPI (MON): The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced.UK UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES (TUE): Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end.UK GDP ESTIMATE (WED): A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought.US CPI (WED): Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern.ECB ANNOUNCEMENT (THU): 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%.AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYMENT (THU): participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms.SWEDISH CPIF (THU): July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak.US RETAIL SALES (THU): Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July. While the data set will offer a glimpse on the health of the consumer amid concerns that the economy may slow significantly in the months ahead, traders will also be watching the University of Michigan's prelim survey release due Friday, where the rise in energy prices is likely to have weighed on sentiment.CHINESE ACTIVITY DATA (FRI): Retail sales Y/Y in August are expected to rise by 2.8% (prev. 2.5%), whilst there is currently no consensus for Industrial Production metrics. The data will be closely watched to diagnose the health of the world\u2019s second-larger economy and to gauge the drip-feed of stimulus seen over recent weeks. Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d.This article originally appeared on Newsquawk This article was written by Newsquawk Analysis at www.forexlive.com.", "content": ": The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August.

Taylor\u2019s actions \u201crewrote the fate of four families for generations to come\u201d, Biden said at the award ceremony. When Biden lands at Hanoi\u2019s Noi Bai International Airport on Sunday, he steps into a very different Vietnam and a phenomenally changed relationship with an old war foe. Biden is scheduled to meet the most senior leaders of Vietnam\u2019s Communist Party \u2013 the political organisation that was once an enemy \u2013 and is expected to sign agreements that elevate US relations to the highest level possible with Hanoi. \u201cThis visit is a remarkable step in the strengthening of our diplomatic ties,\u201d US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said ahead of the visit. \u201cIt reflects the leading role that Vietnam will play in our growing network of partnerships in the Indo-Pacific,\u201d Sullivan said. Both countries, he also said, had laboured to overcome the \u201cpainful shared legacy\u201d of the war, which resulted in the deaths of millions of Vietnamese and 58,000 US service members. While diplomatic ties and trade are foremost in the scheduled meeting between Biden and Vietnam\u2019s most powerful figure, Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, Washington also has its eyes set on China, which is increasingly in the Asia Pacific region. China will be watching Biden\u2019s visit closely, too, weakens Beijing\u2019s influence in Hanoi or alters strategic interests with its southern neighbour. Vietnam and the US are already signatories to a \u201ccomprehensive partnership\u201d, and speculation has focused on the elevation of relations to the highest level of a \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership\u201d \u2013 the most senior level in Vietnam\u2019s diplomatic hierarchy, said Le Hong Hiep, senior fellow and coordinator of the Vietnam Studies Programme at the ISEAS \u2013 Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. If that were to occur during Biden\u2019s visit, it would \u201crepresent a remarkable breakthrough in bilateral ties\u201d, Hiep wrote recently in the ISEAS Fulcrum online magazine. Vietnam \u201conly forms such partnerships with those that it views as of great importance for its security, prosperity, and international standing,\u201d Hiep said. If the agreement is signed, Vietnam will be inviting Washington into a club of just four other comprehensive strategic partners: China, India, Russia, and South Korea. While concerns over a backlash from China are credible, upgrading ties to such a level with the US at this time \u201cmakes perfect sense\u201d for several reasons, Hiep said. Washington\u2019s commitment to keeping the Indo-Pacific maritime area free and open aligns with Vietnam\u2019s interests amid China\u2019s regional muscle flexing. The US is also Vietnam\u2019s second largest trading partner (after China), but the US is, importantly, the largest export market for Vietnamese goods. As Hiep notes, it would be a \u201csensible move for Hanoi\u201d to have closer ties with such an important business partner. Timing is also important. It would be better to make the move to elevate ties with Washington now, before US-China competition sours even further, which could place Vietnam in a more tenuous situation when it came to making such a choice. Nevertheless, closer ties with the US do not mark a major shift in Vietnam\u2019s \u201cstrategic trajectory\u201d, as it is in Hanoi\u2019s best interests to pursue a \u201cbalanced foreign policy towards the major powers\u201d. Nguyen Khac Giang, a scholar of Vietnamese politics and visiting fellow at ISEAS, said the US may place more significance on the upgrade in relations with Vietnam, in terms of a counterbalance to China, than Hanoi has in mind. Vietnam sees the agreement as serving a variety of goals, including the rejuvenation of a struggling economy and strengthening public faith in Vietnam\u2019s foreign policy, Giang told Al Jazeera. For Vietnam, the \u201cupgrade carries both symbolic and practical significance, serving a range of interests from geopolitical counterbalancing to initiatives for economic diversification, making it a calculated risk worth taking,\u201d he said. Vietnam has skilfully balanced its relations with larger powers and it is not about to abandon that approach now, said Carl Thayer, emeritus professor at the Australian Defence Force Academy at the University of New South Wales. What has changed, however, is that Vietnam sees the importance of deepening economic ties with the US when China\u2019s economy is \u201cin deep trouble\u201d and the global economy is slowing. not only hurt its own economy but also had a severe impact on Vietnam\u2019s \u2013 as China is Vietnam\u2019s largest trade partner. The elevating of relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership is \u201cmainly about economics and technology\u201d, Thayer said, adding that such a move is not Hanoi being drawn into \u201can anti-China alliance\u201d with the US. \u201cVietnam will not take a step, in my view, with the US that threatens China\u2019s core interest or give the impression that Vietnam is aligning against China,\u201d Thayer told Al Jazeera. Giang, the scholar of Vietnamese politics, also said the upgrade in relations with Washington will not harm Hanoi\u2019s core interests either. \u201cHanoi likely believes it has the tools to ensure the regime\u2019s ideological core remains untouched by potential US influences,\u201d Giang told Al Jazeera. \u201cI don\u2019t foresee this enhanced relationship threatening the one-party state, especially since Washington has signalled its respect for Vietnam\u2019s existing political system.\u201d", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 21:20:41", "image_url": null, "source_id": "aljazeera_us", "source_priority": 543, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "07aaaae7bcbe13cc19a89b7b7efe5ddd", "title": "Android Circuit: Google Confirms Pixel 8, Microsoft Remembers Surface Duo, Honor Magic V2 Wins IFA", "link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2023/09/09/android-headlines-google-pixel-8-pro-pixel-watch-2-galaxy-s24-ultra-honor-magic-v2/", "keywords": ["Consumer Tech", "/consumer-tech", "Innovation", "/innovation", "Consumer Tech", "/consumer-tech", "technology", "mobile", "standard"], "creator": ["Ewan Spence", " Senior Contributor"], "video_url": null, "description": "This week\u2019s Android Circuit includes Pixel 8 Pro confirmed, Galaxy Z Fold 5 lessons, Galaxy S4 Ultra camera leaks, Honor Magic V2 Wins IFA, Microsoft Remembers Surface Duo, Xiaomi\u2019s increased Android support, and more...", "content": "Forbes Innovation Consumer Tech Android Circuit: Google Confirms Pixel 8, Microsoft Remembers Surface Duo, Honor Magic V2 Wins IFA Ewan Spence Senior Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.

Made By Google Teaser Video It may be a month away, but Google is building up some PR momentum around the \u201cMade By Google\u201d event on October 4th. The Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Watch 2, and Pixel Buds Pro 2 all appeared in Google\u2019s teaser video released earlier this week.

Folds, Z Folds, And Android Software Google\u2019s Pixel Fold may grab the attention, but Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold range is now in its fifth iteration.

At the same time, markets are complex and the depth of information available is overwhelming. \u201cParalysis by analysis\u201d is a real affliction. It particularly affects newer investors as they learn how to separate the wheat from the chaff in under-the-radar stocks. As with any long-term investment strategy, three things matter. First, consider the broad economic conditions. Today, in an era of high(ish) interest rates and economic uncertainty, growth stocks and tech stocks are struggling. Depending on your risk appetite, this can present an opportunity to buy great stocks at bargain prices. Second, underlying fundamentals and financials matter \u2013 particularly in a tight economy. If a company can\u2019t withstand brief uncertainty based on its current financials, it doesn\u2019t matter how great its potential is. To that end, consider the long-term potential. Does the company have a viable product or service that\u2019s in demand and fairly protected from competition? These three companies have fundamental strength and long-term viability to weather (or even thrive) in today\u2019s economy. Each represents a perfect under-the-radar stock for those hunting for overlooked treasure. Under-the-Radar Stocks: Howmet Aerospace (HWM) Howmet Aerospace (NYSE: HWM ) is an aerospace company that manufactures and produces various materials and components for aircraft and aerospace end items. Of course, with space stocks set to hit a net value between $1 trillion and $10 trillion in the next few years, Howmet\u2019s long-term viability as a partner to major aerospace companies is clear. Today, Howmet ensures operational success through diversified products in the trucking industry. As global companies race to tighten up strained supply lines, trucking is a vital link in the chain. Likewise, by producing components for the trucks themselves, Howmet is vital to operational success even as trucking companies pivot to unmanned and autonomous operations . Howmet is financially successful and posted a profit in each of the past three years , with its most recent quarter marking a record $193 million net income . Its cash balance is also healthy, and the aerospace company has enough money to weather occasional down periods if they arise. SharkNinja (SN) SharkNinja (NYSE: SN ) is the definition of an under-the-radar stock, as it snuck onto exchanges via a spinoff in July to limited investor attention. The company might not be at the top of market players\u2019 minds, but it\u2019s a staple in kitchens and homes globally. The company makes and sells a range of appliances, including coffee makers, ice cream machines and hair dryers. Although firmly within consumer discretionary categories, the sluggish economy hasn\u2019t slowed SharkNinja. Instead, the company\u2019s sales have risen 20% each year since 2008. This year, management expects the trends to continue as trends point to $4 billion in revenue by December. Shares trade at a discount compared to similar, semi-luxury appliance brand competitors. Institutional investors are slowly taking note because of the company\u2019s broad appeal, proven strategy and financial readiness. One portfolio manager from Madison Avenue Partners said that SharkNinja is \u201ca gem that\u2019s about to be discovered,\u201d because \u201cSharkNinja has been able to produce new products in categories that haven\u2019t seen much innovation at attractive prices that delight consumers.\u201d Ultimately, any company able to sell higher-end discretionary products in today\u2019s economy is noteworthy. SharkNinja\u2019s success points to long-term upside potential for this under-the-radar stock. Robert Half Inc (RHI) The global job and labor market is changing, and firms like staffing agency Robert Half Inc (NYSE: RHI ) are positioned to ride the new trend to success. Notably, the company is pivoting away from low-margin activities, like temporary staffing solutions, and rotating into long-term contract sourcing. Notably, contract-to-hire models represent much higher margins for Robert Half. At the same time, they ensure a long-term revenue stream as the client and contractor\u2019s relationship matures. Likewise, these roles open opportunities for Robert Half to partner with more professional, skilled and experienced contractors. Ultimately, the move increases value to the client\u2019s organization and cements RHI\u2019s position in their workflow. Small business outsourcing is already booming, and digitization means Robert Half can deliver expertise to small business owners globally, no matter how remote the business is or how lacking local talent pools are. This demand makes matchmaking essential, and Robert Half is particularly well-suited to capitalize on emerging trends. This company and the ones listed above are all under-the-radar stocks that you should consider for your portfolio.

Do this now.", "content": "In today\u2019s dynamic market, many investors are paying attention to the healthcare sector. The segment is known for its resilience and potential for growth. The ongoing global health crisis has only heightened this focus. Many are now seeking the best healthcare stocks to add to their portfolios. Numerous giants in the sector are trading at premium valuations. However, there are also a plethora of undervalued healthcare stocks that offer an attractive entry point. In addition to being affordable healthcare investments, these under-the-radar companies present an opportunity for significant returns. From biotechnology firms developing innovative therapies to companies revolutionizing medical devices and services, our list of cheap healthcare stock picks is curated with a forward-thinking approach. So, without further delay, let us look at some of the best healthcare stocks to buy. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH ) appears to be a beacon in the storm for savvy investors eyeing undervalued healthcare stocks. Although faced with a 6.52% dip in year-to-date return, a recent earnings report shows a glimmer of resilience. There was a 15.65% surge in revenue to $92.9 billion and a 7.97% climb in net income to $5.47 billion in the second quarter of 2023. This reveals a company robust and buoyant amidst a sea of challenges. However, sailing is not all smooth, as regulatory risks continue to loom large on the horizon. UnitedHealth Group stands out as an attractively priced compounder in a world where affordable healthcare investments are as sought after as a desert oasis. The current landscape, though dotted with challenges, is rife with opportunities for the discerning investor. One such challenge is CVS\u2019s (NYSE: CVS ) recovery journey after a PBM contract loss. Another is Humana\u2019s lawsuit against HHS over the Medicare clawback rule. Indeed, the path to cheap healthcare stock picks is paved with caution and promise. Balancing the scales of regulatory risks against the allure of strong financial performance and enticing pricing is key for anyone venturing into healthcare investments. This sector represents an exciting yet unpredictable terrain. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG ) is not just a company; it\u2019s a revolution in the making. A leader in minimally invasive care, the company is transforming how healthcare is delivered with its advanced robotic systems. The recent FDA approval of the da Vinci SP system for simple prostatectomies solidifies its role as a revolutionary force in the healthcare industry. Despite this, the company\u2019s stock experienced a 5% drop after-hours trading. However, this brief decline should not eclipse the company\u2019s ongoing commitment to innovation. Their continuous efforts towards progress are noteworthy and essential to consider. After all, true value often comes at a price. For investors on the hunt for affordable healthcare investments, Intuitive Surgical stands out as a top contender. Despite the necessary costs associated with its groundbreaking innovations, the company remains an appealing option in the sea of cheap healthcare stock picks. Suppose you want to diversify your portfolio while contributing to a future where advanced, minimally invasive care is the norm. In that case, Intuitive Surgical might be the investment you\u2019ve been searching for all this time. Teladoc Health (TDOC) Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC ) is gaining traction in the market and could be a top healthcare stock. Even though there has been a 10% decrease in the past half-year, the latest quarterly results displayed a hopeful 10% rise in revenue to $652.4 million, slightly surpassing predictions by 0.5%. Teladoc\u2019s collaboration with Microsoft to address clinical documentation through artificial intelligence is also a key development. This, along with the forecast that AI will constitute 11% of healthcare budgets in 2024, highlights the tactical decisions Teladoc is making. The expansion of Amazon Clinic nationwide contributed to the stock\u2019s recent fall, but Teladoc quickly recovered with a 6% increase following the earnings beat and positive 2023 guidance. The expanded strategic partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) also positions Teladoc as a powerful AI combo in the healthcare sector. AI is likely to spur healthcare deflation. As a result, Teladoc is a strong player in leveraging technology to revolutionize healthcare services. With the rise of AI in healthcare, Teladoc is positioning itself as a front-runner in the industry. Although the past quarter has declined, the company\u2019s strategic moves are promising. Additionally, technology advancements and strong partnerships indicate a positive trajectory for the future. Investors looking for cheap healthcare stock picks should consider the potential of Teladoc as it continues to innovate and expand its services in an ever-evolving market. With the support of strategic partnerships and innovative technology, Teladoc stands out as a robust and undervalued healthcare stock pick. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Despite a 10% drop year to date, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) remains one of the best healthcare stocks to watch. It demonstrates resilience with a 6% increase in net income and an 8% rise in diluted EPS in the second quarter of 2023. Additionally, it completed a lung cancer trial for Rybrevant and revised its financial outlook following the Kenvue separation. As indicated by Needham, the company\u2019s updated guidance and the MedTech market\u2019s anticipated 7% growth in 2023 make Johnson & Johnson an undervalued healthcare stock worth considering. Moreover, the company reported an annual dividend yield of 2.97%, which is good news for investors seeking regular income. With its recent positive updates and a growing MedTech market, Johnson & Johnson stands out among cheap healthcare stock picks. Despite the recent dip, its strong track record, robust dividend yield, and positive outlook for 2023 make it a compelling investment option. Pfizer (PFE) Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) has been a hot topic among the best healthcare stocks despite a rocky year-to-date return of -33%. Even though the recent earnings report showed a decline in revenue by 54.1% to $12.73 billion, net income dropped by 76.51% to $2.33 billion in July 2023. Despite these setbacks, the pharmaceutical giant remains an attractive proposition. This is especially true as Pfizer and BioNTech recently received endorsement from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) panel for their updated COVID booster. They also received the EU nod for a new Omicron-adapted COVID shot. These recent endorsements are significant in the context of a global pandemic. Moreover, an EPS beat of 15.28% in June 2023 indicates that Pfizer can still deliver positive surprises. Investors looking for affordable healthcare investments might view the recent dip in Pfizer\u2019s performance as intriguing. Despite the decrease in key financial metrics, Pfizer still plays a crucial role in the ongoing battle against COVID-19. In addition, it continues to be an essential addition to any dividend growth portfolio. Additionally, with the FDA reportedly set to clear updated COVID shots as early as Friday, significant upcoming catalysts can aid in the recovery of the stock. While the floor of this decline remains uncertain, Pfizer represents a doubling-down buying opportunity for investors aiming for long-term gains. As the world grapples with virus variants, Pfizer\u2019s role in global health remains more critical than ever. This makes it a compelling option among cheap healthcare stock picks.

What lessons should policymakers have...", "content": "In 2021, federal policy action helped to cut child poverty in half and achieve the lowest child poverty rate in the . In a matter of weeks, however, the Census Bureau is poised to reveal that child poverty rates from 2021 to 2022, likely climbing back to their pre-COVID levels. What lessons should policymakers have learned from COVID-19 for maintaining low child poverty rates moving forward? This is the core question I ask in \u201c ,\u201d and I emphasize three of the many lessons here. First, if Congress wishes to get back to its record-low child poverty rate, it should return to the policy that made it possible: the expanded Child Tax Credit that, in 2021, provided cash payments to nearly all families with children regardless of parents\u2019 employment status. The consequences of the temporary CTC expansion were vast: it immediately cut monthly child poverty rates by around , contributed to the record-low child poverty rate in 2021, temporarily brought the U.S. child poverty rate in line with , had the American welfare state cutting child poverty , cut food hardship among families with children by , had no meaningful short-run consequences for , and increased low-income families\u2019 at child care centers and grocery stores. The pandemic not only provided evidence on which policies work to reduce children\u2019s exposure to poverty, but also the urgency of doing so: at the start of 2020, the average Black adult who was in poverty had also spent 57 percent of her childhood in poverty, compared to 20 percent for the average White adult in poverty. These disparate experiences of poverty, accumulating from birth onward, contributed directly to racial/ethnic disparities in health and employment outcomes at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cumulative exposure to poverty from childhood onward helps to explain why adults in the highest poverty counties in the U.S. had a COVID-related death rate nearly twice that of adults in the lowest-poverty counties, equivalent to the gaps in death rates between Germany and Romania in the EU. Poverty, after all, is not merely a point-in-time state, but an economic condition that, once experienced, often lingers throughout one\u2019s life, inflicting costs that range from poorer health conditions to reduced long-run economic opportunity. The 2021 CTC expansion worked in reducing those costs, but its discontinuation ensures that child poverty is poised to rise again. Second, if cross-party compromise is necessary to achieve an expanded, 2021-like CTC, then Democrats should be ready to to trade-in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.\u201cWelfare,\u201d as the program is commonly known, provided very little direct support for families during the pandemic: cash support from ; the expanded CTC, in contrast, cut child poverty rates by 44 percent the next year \u2014 15 times the magnitude of TANF. Meanwhile, state governments target toward Black families relative to White families, exacerbating racial differences in poverty targets. And TANF itself is shrinking each year: the program\u2019s annual funding level is not updated for inflation, ensuring that its overall cost, and also its trade-in value, decreases by the year. There are costs to abandoning TANF, but should the political balance of Congress require that it need to identify cost offsets in order to fund an expanded CTC at 2021 benefit levels, TANF should not be excluded from consideration. A third lesson: Congress should Invest more resources into the Census Bureau\u2019s data-collection capabilities to better track, in close to real-time, the well-being of households across the country. The pandemic revealed that our public data infrastructure is not prepared to inform month-to-month trends in poverty and hardship. As a result, researchers like me have had to get creative to track poverty on a , to measure exposure to across the country, and more. But knowledge of how low-income households are faring on a month-to-month basis should not be a result of researchers\u2019 data innovations; instead, adding four questions \u2013 one each on total resources received during the prior month, food insufficiency, mental health, and housing hardship \u2013 to the Census Bureau\u2019s and Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 monthly household surveys would offer representative and real-time measures of the well-being of the nation moving forward. The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us the importance of having timely and comprehensive data on poverty and well-being to guide policymaking decisions; these small changes would allow for that beyond the pandemic. There are several other key policy lessons that emerge from COVID-19 and that \u201c \u201d elaborates on. To name a few: we should learn from the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and expand access to Unemployment Insurance (UI) among jobless adults, even before prioritizing UI benefit increases. We should build the administrative capacity to convert the Paycheck Protection Program into a targeted work-sharing program. And we should convert some lump-sum, refundable tax credits to monthly payments to better help households with their everyday needs. The COVID-19 pandemic offered many lessons for improving economic well-being in the U.S. beyond the pandemic. We witnessed the menacing consequences of poverty, but also the enormous power and capability of the state to reduce poverty and improve well-being among households going through difficult times. To not apply these lessons moving forward would be a detriment to all those who happen to experience life in low-income America.", "pubDate": "2023-09-08 22:30:00", "image_url": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/ca_childtaxcredit_ap.jpg?w=900", "source_id": "thehill", "source_priority": 393, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["politics"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "846aaf61686235dca0c3ef61ceef1c15", "title": "Gemini vs. Coinbase: How the Crypto Exchanges Compare", "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/gemini-vs-coinbase", "keywords": null, "creator": ["Rickie Houston", "Tessa Campbell"], "video_url": null, "description": null, "content": "Our experts answer readers' investing questions and write unbiased product reviews ( here's how we assess investing products ).

The BBB also notes that most complaints filed against Gemini after January 2021 were due to customers being unable to access bitcoin in their Gemini account. Many users also believe that Gemini's verification process for withdrawals and transfers slows transactions. In November 2022, Genesis stopped Gemini Earn investors from withdrawing crypto from their accounts due to Genesis' lack of sufficient liquid assets to meet withdrawal requests. The Gemini Earn program was then terminated . In February 2022, a Gemini crypto hack led to the loss of roughly $37 million in assets of clients with crypto IRAs held through IRA Financial Trust. IRA Financial Trust sued Gemini, and both Gemini and IRA Financial Trusts became the targets of client lawsuits. On January 12, 2023, the SEC charged a complaint against Genesis and Gemini, claiming unregistered offer and sale of securities to retail investors through the Earn program.

Coinbase paid a $50 million penalty. In 2023, the SEC started investigating Coinbase after against Coinbase on June 6, 2023. The lawsuit claims that Coinbase offered crypto trading on its unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency \u2014 and that Coinbase allowed sales on its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program.

Therefore, a C+ is an ok rating of customer trustworthiness. The BBB states that the reason for the C+ rating is due to a failure to respond to one complaint against the business. Before issuing ratings, the bureau also considers a company's time in business (including its business type), customer complaint history, licensing and government actions, and advertising issues. But its ratings don't absolutely ensure a company will be reliable or perform well. This is why it's important to also do your own homework before setting up an account.

CEO, Author, Keynote Speaker, Leadership Strategist, Poet Following Sep 8, 2023, 05:13pm EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Photo by JOHN MACDOUGALL/AFP via Getty Images AFP via Getty Images I had the privilege of conversing with Josh Bernoff, author of the new book, \u201cBuild a Better Business Book: How to Plan, Write, and Promote a Book That Matters.\u201d Bernoff is a seasoned expert in the field of business writing. The insights from this conversation, drawn from Bernoff\u2019s extensive experience and unique perspective, are invaluable for anyone looking to make their mark in business literature. Bernoff brought up a few crucial and helpful points, including the following: 1. Business Books: Catalysts for Thought Leadership \u201cBusiness books are a way to propel thinkers to prominence,\u201d Bernoff shared. This statement underscores the power of business books. They are not just compilations of ideas or theories, but catalysts that can elevate thinkers to new heights of recognition. Bernoff\u2019s experience is a testament to this, with the book projects he\u2019s been involved in generating over $20 million for their authors. But the benefits extend beyond monetary gain. A well-crafted business book can bolster a career, establish authority in a field, and unlock doors to unexplored opportunities. It\u2019s about creating a lasting impact and contributing to the knowledge reservoir of the industry. It\u2019s about making a difference, and leaving a legacy that goes beyond the confines of personal achievement and extends to the broader business community. In the world of business, thought leadership is a coveted position. It allows you to influence, guide, and inspire. And a business book is a powerful tool that can help you achieve this position. You had better get the book right if you want to be a successful thought leader. 2. The Necessity of an Author\u2019s Platform In the digital era, an author\u2019s platform is an indispensable asset. \u201cThe platform supports the book,\u201d Bernoff pointed out. \u201cThe book is not the platform.\u201d MORE FOR YOU \u2018One Piece\u2019 Already Dethroned In Netflix\u2019s Top 10 List By A New Show Indian Billionaire Ranjan Pai Is Looking To Cement His Legacy With A Billion-Dollar Windfall. Is A Calculated Bet To Fund Troubled Startups The First Step? New Pixel 8 Pro Leaks Reveal Google s Smart Decision Whether through regular speeches or keynotes, a column in a trade magazine, a newsletter, or a significant social media following, a platform is a conduit to readers. It\u2019s a megaphone, amplifying ideas to the world. As Bernoff aptly put it, \u201cA book without promotion will just lie there, and it won\u2019t do much for you.\u201d Your platform can be a promotional powerhouse, ensuring a book doesn\u2019t just lie there but leaps into the hands of eager readers. But a platform is more than just a promotional tool. It\u2019s a bridge that connects you with your readers. It\u2019s a way to engage with your audience, understand their needs and interests, and provide them with value. It\u2019s a way to build a community of readers who share your passion for business and your desire to make a difference. 3. Engaging Readers: The Art of Creating Urgency While it may sound unconventional, Bernoff recommends a unique opening approach to a book. \u201cThe first chapter of your book needs to scare the crap out of people,\u201d he said. This doesn\u2019t imply resorting to shock tactics or sensationalism. Instead, it\u2019s about presenting a compelling problem or challenge to which a reader can relate while promising a solution. This scary first chapter creates a sense of urgency and curiosity, compelling the reader to continue reading to discover more. \u201cYou need to make them uncomfortable,\u201d Bernoff added, \u201cand then you need to make them comfortable by showing them that you have a solution.\u201d Engaging readers is about more than just grabbing their attention. It\u2019s about holding their interest, and keeping them hooked from the first page to the last. It\u2019s about creating a narrative that is not only informative but also compelling. It\u2019s about creating a narrative that resonates with the reader, speaks to their needs and interests, and provides them with value. 4. The Power of Stories and Evidence Bernoff emphasized the importance of stories and evidence in writing a business book. He said, \u201cYou need to fuel the book with case study stories about the kind of people who you\u2019re trying to help, what worked and what didn\u2019t work.\u201d This doesn\u2019t just happen; you have to put an enormous amount of effort into collecting those stories from your clients, from people you\u2019ve heard about, from the news, or by reaching out and collecting those stories elsewhere. When you start to write, the stories are the fuel that makes it possible for you to create an entertaining and interesting book. Stories and evidence are the backbone of any good business book. They provide the context and credibility that your ideas need to resonate with your readers. They bring your ideas to life, making them tangible and relatable. They make your book more than just a collection of abstract theories and concepts. They make it a guide, a roadmap that your readers can use to navigate their own business challenges. 5. The Importance of Differentiation Bernoff also highlighted the importance of differentiation in writing a business book. He said, \u201cYour book has to be the first book that makes it different from all the other books in the space that you\u2019re in.\u201d This differentiation could come in various forms. Your book might be the first to have actual data from consumers. Or it could be the first book with clear step-by-step instructions and diagrams on a new concept. Build a Better Business Book Josh Bernoff Differentiation is what sets your book apart from the rest. It\u2019s what makes it unique, what makes it stand out in a crowded marketplace. It\u2019s what gives your readers a reason to choose your book over all the others. It\u2019s the difference between your book being a must-read or a must-have resource for anyone looking to succeed in business versus other boring ones. Ultimately, the art of writing business books is a delicate balance of presenting compelling ideas, leveraging a platform, engaging readers, and aiming for a larger goal. It\u2019s about creating a narrative that not only informs but also transforms. It\u2019s about making a difference in the world of business, one book at a time. Build a Better Business Book: How to Plan, Write, and Promote a Book That Matters is an essential read for those would-be and already-established business book authors.

You can soon buy shares of Instacart stock on the Nasdaq following Instacart's IPO in September 2023. To buy Instacart stock, set up a brokerage account, research Instacart financials, and come up with an investment strategy. IPO stocks tend to go to institutions and high-net-worth investors first, so retail investors will have to be patient. The end of summer 2023 marks a new beginning for Instacart, as the popular grocery delivery and pick-up service announces that its initial public offering ( IPO ) is scheduled for some point in September 2023. After years of teasing a much-anticipated public offering, the time has finally come, making it one of the most high-profile US listings this year. However, retail investors may still have a hard time buying the stock as IPO shares are often reserved for high-net-worth investors, bankers, hedge funds , and large institutions. Right now, SoFi Invest is the only confirmed brokerage that plans to offer Instacart stock to its users. Here's how you can buy Instacart stock (CART). Learn how to buy shares in some of the largest US tech companies on the market. Here's how to buy Amazon stock and Insider's step-by-step guide on how to buy Apple stock . About the Instacart IPO On August 25, 2023, Instacart officially filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to become a publicly traded company. The business was founded in 2012 and over time has accumulated funding from 37 venture capital firms. The largest investors in Instacart to date have been Sequoia Capital and Capital Partners. The lead underwriters for Instacart's IPO are Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase. As a private company, only venture capitalists and certain high-net-worth individuals have previously been able to get their hands on Instacart shares (aka private equity). The main goal for private equity investors is to \"increase the company's profit from an exit,\" explains Matt Malone, head of investment management at Opto Investments . \"The exit could be an initial public offering (IPO), sale, or other liquidity event. Private equity investors are paid with proceeds from those exits.\" But that's all set to change. Soon retail investors will be able to find Instacart stock on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker \"CART.\" Retail investors are individual investors who use their own funds to buy, sell, and trade assets through brokerages/investment platforms. Not only will Instacart be the most notable US venture-backed tech IPO since December 2021 , but it will also be the first independent grocery delivery business to ever go public. While no one knows for certain how it will all shake out, it has been revealed that Instacart plans to sell $175 million in Series A preferred stock to PepsiCo . SoFi , one of the best robo-advisors , is underwriting Instacart's IPO with plans to offer shares to SoFi users. How to buy Instacart stock 1. Set up a brokerage account First things first, you must have a brokerage account in order to buy Instacart stock. Traditional and online brokerage accounts allow you to access the stock market, invest in various asset classes, and securely store your investments all in one place. \"A brokerage is where your investment portfolio lives \u2014 this can be directly with an investment institution, either self-managed or managed by a broker-dealer or registered investment advisory firm. An online brokerage does the same thing, but usually, these are either a DIY option or the company uses an algorithm to invest your portfolio,\" says Samantha Gorelick, CFP and managing financial planner at Brunch & Budget .

There are several brokerage platforms out there, each with different requirements, limitations, fees, web and mobile access, and resources. Some of the most well-known online brokerages include Charles Schwab , TD Ameritrade , Robinhood , and Interactive Brokers . SoFi Invest is the only brokerage known to hold Instacart shares with the intention of offering stock to its users. Therefore, opening an account with SoFi is not only your best option, but also your only option at this time. Brokerages other than SoFi that will offer Instacart IPO stock are still largely up in the air. You might also get some luck by opening an account with a broker that already offers IPO access. Robinhood, for example, offers IPO access to users through its IPO Access Program. But there's no guarantee that you'll get access to Instacart stock. You may also be able to invest in Instacart through mutual funds , such as Fidelity's Growth Company Fund. Fidelity recently bumped its Instacart Series H shares up 10% at the end of May 2023. 2. Research Instacart financials While investing in a big name like Instacart may sound like a safe investment decision, it's essential that you do your due diligence first and conduct your own research. Although you can't review Instacart's historical stock performance, you can still tune into the company's recent profit history and current market standing. Some key resources to analyze include: Company quarterly earnings reports Income statements Balance sheets After skyrocketing during the COVID-19 pandemic and reaching its peak in Q2 of 2022, Instacart found itself steadily declining as inflation marked up prices on groceries and as people returned to shopping for themselves. Last year, the company cut its valuation multiple times. However, in 2023, Instacart raised its valuation to about $12 billion . Instacart closed 2022 with $428 million in profits. During the first six months of 2023, Instacart reported a profit of $242 million. That's a significant increase compared to what the company earned during the same period the previous year . Despite its recent success, higher grocery prices and economic concerns could hurt Instacart's success in the long run. 3. Determine how much to invest and place an order In general, how much you want to invest depends on your individual investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. It also depends on the price of the shares and how much you're looking to spend. There are four main types of orders you can make when requesting the share price you want: Market order : Orders are immediately executed so that the per-share price currently reflects the stock's current share value. But you can't set the share price before executions, which doesn't make it ideal for investors hoping to bear the stock's current market value. Limit order : You can set a price threshold for shares for buying and selling stock. This is best for investors who want control over how much they are spending on shares. For example, if Instacart stock is trading at $200, and you set your limit order for $150, the brokerage won't complete your order unless the stock's value drops to your limit order price. Stop order : Also called stop-loss order, this order type allows you to set a stop price. That means that if your stock reaches the stop price, it will become a market order and be executed immediately. Stop-limit order : Similar to a stop order, this type of order allows you to establish a set price to stop for your stock's value. But instead of becoming a market order, your order becomes a limit order when your stocks reach the established stock price. But just because you request a certain number of shares doesn't guarantee that you'll get it. As mentioned above, IPO shares tend to be reserved for high-net-worth individuals and intuitions, so retail investors may struggle to get in on the action. Plus, brokers only have a set number of shares available, so you'll have to be patient. 4. Review your purchase and monitor your investment Getting the shares is only the first step in turning a profit. You'll need to implement an investing strategy, such as a buy-and-hold strategy or dollar-cost averaging. This way, you won't be glued to the market hour by hour watching Instacart's stock chart. Here are some common investing strategies: Buy-and-hold : This investment strategy is most appealing to passive and long-term investors. After purchasing a lump sum's worth of Instacart stock, you can sit back and wait for your shares to increase in value over time. You won't cash out until you feel the time is right. Dollar-cost averaging : If you want to regularly contribute to Instacart, this strategy may be a good fit. Instead of purchasing a large sum at once, you can determine how much you're wanting to periodically invest (e.g., $10, $50, $100). As with an investment, no investment is immune to the fluctuations of the stock market. In the event of a struggling economy or a bear market , share prices may drop drastically. Make sure to keep cool and don't make any rash decisions. \"The risk of loss is possibly the greatest risk when investing your money. Diversification can help to mitigate this risk,\" says Gorelick.
