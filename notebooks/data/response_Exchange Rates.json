Sex worker Rahab helped hide spies in her house. Lebrecht/Getty While some Christians might protest that Rahab\u2019s profession is incidental to the story, there\u2019s some academic debate about this. In one recent article Dr. Alexiana Fry asks \u201cDid the spies encounter Rahab because they were seeking sex?\u201d If James Bond has taught us anything, it\u2019s that spies have voracious sexual appetites. If that\u2019s the case then Rahab\u2019s profession is critically important. Then there\u2019s the messier and lesser-known story of Tamar in the book of Genesis. Tamar married Er, the son of Judah (the eponymous founder of the tribe of Judah) but Er died before they had any children. Judah commanded that Tamar marry Er\u2019s brother Onan in what is known as a levirate union. In this arrangement, when a man died without children, his brother would procreate with his widow and the resulting male offspring would become the deceased\u2019s legal heirs. (Yes, you did read that correctly. There\u2019s even a story in the New Testament in which Jesus is quizzed about a hypothetical situation in which a woman married seven brothers in succession). Onan, Er\u2019s younger brother, was perfectly happy to have sex with Tamar, but he didn\u2019t want to lose his additional share of Er\u2019s inheritance to a new baby. So, in the Bible\u2019s first instance of contraception, he withdrew and \u201cspilled his seed on the ground.\u201d God is unimpressed and kills Er, leaving Tamar widowed again. There is a third brother, Shelah, but he is too young to marry and so Tamar waits in her father-in-law\u2019s house for the boy to reach manhood. When he does, Judah reneges on his promise. Alone, used, and deceived, Tamar takes things into her own hands. Judah himself recently became a widower and when Tamar learned he was taking a trip she dressed herself up as a sex worker, veiled her face, and placed herself in his path. Judah did not recognize his daughter-in-law on the roadside and propositioned her. In their negotiations over the price of sex Tamar accepted the offer of a young goat but asked for Judah\u2019s seal, cord, and staff (the equivalent of his driver\u2019s license) as collateral until the goat arrived. Judah agreed and they exchanged goods. When Judah returns to swap out the goat for his personal effects the \u201cshrine prostitute\u201d had vanished. The embarrassed Judah decides to keep quiet about the whole thing. Judah and his daughter-in-law Tamar. Sepia Times/Getty Predictably, however, Tamar becomes pregnant, and her male relatives are on the cusp of burning her to death when she produces the seal, staff, and cord. Judah recognizes his property and concludes that her act of deception and prostitution was fair play: \u201cShe is more righteous than I,\u201d he says, \u201csince I wouldn\u2019t give her to my son Shelah.\u201d Tamar didn\u2019t have to sleep with her in-laws anymore and her twin sons became the heirs to Judah. In the New Testament, as is relatively well-known, Jesus regularly fraternizes with sex workers (not like that, though). In one story, that appears in various versions in the Gospels, a woman bursts into the home of Simon the leper in Bethany and anoints Jesus with a costly jar of perfumed ointment. (In 591 CE Pope Gregory the Great mistakenly identified this woman as Mary Magdalene, sparking two millennia of confusion about Mary M\u2019s profession.) The sulky disciples are quite sniffy about the whole thing and declare it a waste of money, but Jesus shuts that down. He responds that she has anointed him for burial, \u201cTruly I tell you, wherever the good news is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in remembrance of her.\u201d As Sarah Levin-Richardson has written in her book on The Brothel of Pompeii , sex workers were often gifted perfume by clients. The fact that this woman is moving around unaccompanied at night and has access to perfumed oil, thus, suggests that she was part of the world\u2019s oldest profession. A woman, who Pope Gregory the Great, mistakenly identified as Mary Magdalene anoints the feet of Jesus. Hulton Archive/Getty In Luke\u2019s version of the story, the woman\u2019s occupation is quite explicit, she is described as a \u201csinful woman.\u201d In this version, she washes his feet with her tears and dries them with her hair. Once again, Jesus rebukes her critics\u2014in this instance, a Pharisee. Though in this version Jesus does refer to the woman\u2019s many sins and forgives them, he does not ask her to change her profession or explicitly refer to sexual misconduct as being among her sins. This is in distinction to a story in the Gospel of John in which he directly tells a man he had just healed to \u201csin no more.\u201d At a minimum, Jesus isn\u2019t that hung up on her trade and was happy for her to use the fruits of her work to anoint him. Though some readers might think that these stories are outliers in a compendium of old-fashioned patriarchal morality, the women are not. Jesus\u2019s words about the woman who anoints him form one of his most secure prophecies: we are, in fact, still talking about her. As for Tamar and Rahab, in Christian tradition they are remembered as instrumental in the history of Israel and genealogy of Jesus himself. The Gospel of Matthew begins with a long list of ancestors that ties Jesus, through Joseph, to David and Abraham. It is, as you would expect, a long list of men begetting one another. But explicitly named in this catalog of men are five women: Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, the wife of Uriah (i.e. Bathsheba), and Mary, the mother of Jesus. What ties these women together? Well, while someone might argue that the four women who preceded Mary are outsiders and their inclusion signals that Jesus\u2019 message would be delivered to gentiles as well as Jews this argument doesn\u2019t quite work. How would these women be connected to Mary, a Jew? The other explanation is that all five women were involved in sexual scandals. Tamar and Rahab had practiced sex work; Ruth seduced and later married her kinsman Boaz; and, in the view of ancient readers, Bathsheba was an adulteress. What links them to Mary is the veil of suspicion that surrounded the conception of Jesus. In the Gospels she is explicitly identified as a virgin who had not had sex with anyone, but plenty of non-Christians found the tale a bit hard to believe if not outright laughable. The North African Christian writer Tertullian tells us that people accused Jesus of being the \u201cson of a carpenter or a whore.\u201d The pagan critic Celsus says that she was seeing a Roman soldier on the side. Mary might have been a virgin, but she had a bad reputation and was regularly slut shamed by Christianity\u2019s critics. Leaving Mary aside, the fact remains that for early Christians the women who broke the sexual rules were instrumental in the history of Israel and the generation of Jesus. Assertive women who used the resources they had to better their circumstances and those of their family members are implicitly valued and respected. More importantly they play a critical role in securing the success and survival of God\u2019s chosen people. The genealogy of Jesus\u00ad\u2014which omits the docile wives and virtuous homemakers in Israel\u2019s history\u2014is a tacit indictment of slut shaming writ large. As it turns out, well-behaved women rarely rate a mention in the history of Jesus. Candida Moss @candidamoss candidarmoss@gmail.com Got a tip?

It would include India, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Israel and the European Union, said Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s national security advisor. Sullivan said the network reflected Biden\u2019s vision for \u201cfar-reaching investments\u201d that come from \u201ceffective American leadership\u201d and a willingness to embrace other nations as partners. He said the enhanced infrastructure would boost economic growth, help bring countries in the Middle East together and establish that region as a hub for economic activity instead of as a \u201csource of challenge, conflict or crisis\u201d as it has been in recent history. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi , European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other leaders from around the world participated in the announcement. \u201cEnhancing connectivity with all regions has been a key priority for India,\u201d said Modi, speaking through an interpreter. \u201cWe believe that connectivity is a means to not only increase mutual trade between different countries but also increase mutual trust.\u201d The rail and shipping corridor would help physically tie together a vast stretch of the globe, improving digital connectivity and enabling more trade among countries, including with energy products such as hydrogen. Although White House officials did not set a timeline for its completion, the corridor would provide a physical and ideological alternative to China\u2019s own nation-spanning infrastructure program. The White House gave no details on the project\u2019s cost or financing, though Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman mentioned a figure of $20 billion during the announcement. It was unclear whether that sum applied solely to the Saudi commitment. After the announcement, Biden greeted the crown prince with a hearty handshake , a friendlier exchange than when they last met, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, just over a year ago. At that time, Biden, who had harshly criticized Prince Mohammed over the kingdom\u2019s human rights record, awkwardly greeted him with a fist bump, a moment roundly criticized by rights activists. Von der Leyen described the project as a \u201cgreen and digital bridge across continents and civilizations.\u201d She added that it includes cables to transmit electricity and data. She also announced a \u201cTrans-African Corridor\u201d connecting the Angolan port of Lobito with landlocked areas of the continent: the Kananga province in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the copper-mining regions of Zambia. Speaking of the African project, Biden called it a \u201cgame-changing regional investment\u201d and said \u201cboth of these are huge, huge steps forward.\u201d Amos Hochstein, Biden\u2019s coordinator for global infrastructure and energy security, laid out a rough timeline for the project over the next year. In the next 60 days, working groups will put together a fuller plan and set timelines. The first phase will involve identifying the areas that need investment and where physical infrastructure can be connected between countries. Hochstein said the plans can be put into place over the next year so that the project can move onto setting up finances and construction. Sullivan said the project started coming together after Biden visited Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in July 2022, where he emphasized a need for greater regional economic integration. In January, the White House started having conversations with regional partners about the concept. By spring, maps and written assessments of existing rail infrastructure in the Middle East were being drafted. Sullivan, and senior White House aides Hochstein and Brett McGurk, traveled to Saudi Arabia in May to meet with their Indian, Saudi and UAE counterparts. All sides have worked since then to finalize details of the agreement announced Saturday. The parties also brought Israel and Jordan into the project. Saudi Arabia and Israel do not have diplomatic relations, though the White House has been pushing them toward normalizing relations. Sullivan said the transportation project is not seen as a \u201cprecursor\u201d to a potential normalization deal but he characterized Israel\u2019s inclusion as \u201csignificant.\u201d \u201cThe participants in this effort are focused on practical outcomes that deliver for their people,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cAnd a corridor of this kind by dint of geography works best having Israel in as opposed to out and the countries participating prioritized that.\u201d Biden participated in both G20 sessions on Saturday. He highlighted plans to push for more investments to address climate change, such as his own domestic incentives to encourage the use of renewable energy. He also argued that Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is hurting many other nations, which have had to cope with greater food and energy costs as well as higher interest rate costs on their debt. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been a regular presence at international summits, including last year\u2019s G20 in Indonesia, since Russia invaded his country more than 18 months ago, was not invited by Modi\u2019s government to this year\u2019s gathering. Zelensky has used the high-profile gatherings to argue for continued economic and military support for his country. India is one of the most prominent U.S. allies that has largely stayed on the sidelines of the war, and has even dramatically increased its purchases of Russian oil. Jon Finer, the White House principal deputy national security advisor, said the administration pushed for Zelensky\u2019s inclusion at the summit. \u201cUltimately, it is not our decision,\u201d Finer said. \u201cBut you can expect that the United States and our other partners who are working with Ukraine so closely ... We\u2019ll make that case quite forcefully in the context of these conversations.\u201d The summit communique, a joint statement agreed to by all participants, addressed the war, among other issues. It included language underlining the principle that states cannot use force to change borders, disavowed the use of nuclear weapons and called for a just peace based on the principles of the U.N. Charter. The communique also underscored that attacks on civilian infrastructure must end. During the summit, Biden also discussed his request to Congress for additional funding for the World Bank that could generate more than $25 billion in new lending for economic development. The White House more broadly is trying to strengthen the G20 as an international forum, while Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin decided not to attend. Biden has said he was disappointed by Xi\u2019s decision. Asked again about the Chinese leader\u2019s absence, Biden said Saturday that the summit \u201cis going well\u201d though \u201cit would be nice to have him here.\u201d", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 18:54:58", "image_url": null, "source_id": "latimes", "source_priority": 267, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "508b5f9b2879c77dfe4058f0631ca885", "title": "CD and Savings Account Rates Today", "link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/cd-rates-savings-account-rates-today-saturday-9-2023-9", "keywords": null, "creator": ["Business Insider"], "video_url": null, "description": null, "content": "Our experts answer readers' banking questions and write unbiased product reviews ( here's how we assess banking products ).

About High-Yield Accounts High-yield savings accounts aren't the only accounts paying favorable rates right now. You'll typically see the highest rates at online or lower-profile institutions rather than national brands with a significant brick and mortar presence. This is normal; online banks have lower overhead cost and are willing to pay high rates to attract new customers. High-Yield Savings Accounts The best high-yield savings accounts provide the security of a savings account with the added bonus of a high APY. Savings accounts are held at a bank or credit union \u2014 not invested through a brokerage account \u2014 and are best for saving cash in pursuit of shorter-term goals, like a vacation or big purchase. High-Yield Checking Accounts The best high-yield checking accounts tend to pay slightly lower rates than high-yield savings, but even they are strong in today's rate environment. A checking account is like a hub for your money: If your paycheck is direct deposited, it's typically to a checking account. If you transfer money to pay a bill, you typically do it from a checking account. Checking accounts are used for everyday spending and usually come with checks and/or debit cards to make that easy. Money Market Accounts The best money market accounts could be considered a middle ground between checking and savings: They are used for saving money but typically provide easy access to your account through checks or a debit card. They usually offer a tiered interest rate depending on your balance. Cash Management Accounts A cash management account is also like a savings/checking hybrid. You'll generally see them offered by online banks, and, unlike a checking account, they usually offer unlimited transfers. A savings account often limits the number of monthly transfers, while a checking account doesn't. Cash management accounts typically come with a debit card for easy access, but you may have to pay a fee if you want to deposit cash. Certificates of Deposit The best CD rates may outpace any of the other accounts we've described above. That's because a certificate of deposit requires you to \"lock in\" your money for a predetermined amount of time ranging from three months to five years. To retrieve it before then, you'll pay a penalty (unless you opt for one of the best no-penalty CDs ). The longer you'll let the bank hold your money, the higher rate you'll get. CD rates aren't variable; the rate you get upon depositing your money is the rate you'll get for the length of your term. About CD Terms Locking your money into an account in exchange for a higher interest rate can be a big decision. Here's what you need to know about common CD terms. No-Penalty CDs Most CDs charge you a fee if you need to withdraw money from your account before the term ends. But with a no-penalty CD, you won't have to pay an early withdrawal penalty. The best no-penalty CDs will offer rates slightly higher than the best high-yield savings accounts , and can offer a substantially improved interest rate over traditional brick-and-mortar savings accounts. 6-Month CDs The best 6-month CDs are offering interest rates in the mid-5% range. Six-month CDs are best for those who are looking for elevated rates on their savings for short-term gains, but are uncomfortable having limited access to their cash in the long term. These can be a good option for those who may just be getting started with saving, or who don't have a large emergency fund for unexpected expenses. 1-Year CDs The best 1-year CDs tend to offer some of the top CD rates, and are a popular option for many investors. A 1-year term can be an attractive option for someone building a CD ladder , or for someone who has a reasonable cash safety net but is still concerned about long-term expenses. 2-Year CDs The best 2-year CD rates will be slightly lower than 1-year and no-penalty CD rates. In exchange for a longer lock-in period, investors receive a long-term commitment for a specific rate. These are best used as part of a CD ladder strategy, or for those worried about a declining rate market in the foreseeable future. 3-Year CDs The best 3-year CDs tend to have rates that are comparable to 2-year CDs. These are usually less popular for your average investor, but can be an important lever when diversifying investments and hedging against the risk of unfavorable rate markets in the long term. 5-Year CDs The best 5-year CDs will offer lower rates than the other terms on our list, but are still popular options for investors. These CDs are best for those looking to lock in high rates for the long term. CDs are generally viewed as safe investment vehicles, and securing a favorable rate can yield considerable earnings in year three and beyond \u2014 even if rates fall elsewhere.

How did Medvedev rate his performance against Alcaraz in the semifinals Friday night? \"I played 12 out of 10,\" Medvedev declared after eliminating Alcaraz 7-6 (3), 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 to set up a rematch in the final against Novak Djokovic, a 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (4) winner over unseeded American Ben Shelton earlier Friday. The No. 3-seeded Medvedev won his lone major championship at Flushing Meadows in 2021 by defeating 23-time Slam winner Djokovic in that year's title match. That prevented Djokovic from completing what would have been the first calendar-year Grand Slam in men's tennis since 1969. Even before the start of these two weeks, folks had been anticipating a Djokovic vs. Alcaraz showdown for the title. Theirs is an intergenerational rivalry -- Djokovic is 36; Alcaraz 20 -- that has fascinated the tennis world in recent months. A meeting in New York on Sunday would have been a rematch of the final of the Cincinnati Masters last month, won by Djokovic, and of the final at Wimbledon in July, won by Alcaraz, and of a semifinal at the French Open in June, won by Djokovic. But it was not to be. Medvedev stood in the way. \"These kind of matches can happen,\" Alcaraz said. Alcaraz -- who will relinquish the No. 1 ranking to Djokovic no matter what happens on Sunday -- had been trying to become the first man to claim consecutive championships in New York since Roger Federer won five in a row from 2004 to 2008. Alcaraz spoke days earlier about his growth over the past year and how much more mature he's become. \"After this match, I'm going to change my mind,\" Alcaraz said. \"I'm not mature enough.\" So instead, it will be Medvedev, a 27-year-old from Russia, who will be appearing in his third US Open final in five years and his fifth major title match in all. He lost to Rafael Nadal in New York in 2019 and at the Australian Open in 2022, and to Djokovic at the Australian Open in 2021. \"The challenge is that you play a guy that won 23 Grand Slams, and I have only one,\" Medvedev said, looking ahead to taking on Djokovic. \"When I beat him here, I managed to play better than myself, so I need to do it again. There is no other way.\" Medvedev had lost to Alcaraz twice this season, including in the Wimbledon semifinals. Those head-to-head results left Medvedev concerned. \"Before the match, for sure, a lot of doubts,\" he said. But Medvedev was up to the task, defeating a world No. 1 for the sixth time -- the only active players with more wins over ATP No. 1s are Nadal (23), Djokovic (16) and Andy Murray (12) -- and continuing his unparalleled success on hard court. Since the start of 2018, nobody has recorded more match wins (235), final appearances (28) and titles (18) on hard courts than Medvedev. He stood way back to return serves and would conjure up passing shots \"from his house,\" Alcaraz observed with a smile, also noting that Medvedev hit his forehand harder than usual. One key moment: From 3-all in the opening tiebreaker, Medvedev grabbed the next four points and that set. \"I totally [lost] my mind,\" Alcaraz said. When Medvedev went up 3-0 in the second set, Alcaraz went to the sideline and thought about smacking his racket against a couple of plastic bottles on the floor near his seat, but held back. \"It was tough,\" Alcaraz said, \"for me to stay calm.\" There were moments of brilliance from both men, displays of athleticism, instincts and shot-making that brought fans out of their seats. Also often jumping up from his spot in a corner guest box at Arthur Ashe Stadium was Juan Carlos Ferrero, the 2003 French Open champion who is Alcaraz's coach. Ferrero was looking nervous throughout the second set as the match appeared to be getting away from his guy, keeping up a constant patter of instructions and exhortations in Spanish. It all helped, if only briefly. Alcaraz really got going in the third set, and his net-charging tactics -- including plenty of serve-and-volleying -- were effective. He won 54 of 70 points that he finished at the net. Medvedev served about as well as ever. He saved eight of the nine break points he faced and then often got the better of the match's shortest points, winning 101 of the 174 exchanges that lasted four strokes or fewer. \"Against someone like Carlos, you have to serve well,\" Medvedev said. \"You have no other choice.\" The final twist came with Alcaraz serving down 3-2 in the fourth set. It was a lengthy game that lasted nearly 15 minutes, filled with a ton of impressive returning by the lanky Medvedev, whose long arms seem to get his racket to everything. When one Medvedev return landed out, Alcaraz looked up and put his hands together, as if to say, \"Thank you!\" But Alcaraz missed one volley, and then couldn't quite deliver as he reached to try to get to a dipping, angled backhand return. \"That game was amazing,\" Medvedev would say later. It gave Medvedev the lead and an edge he would not relinquish, even if he did need to put aside a pair of double-faults while serving for the victory as some spectators called out to distract him. \"That's not so nice. But I'm happy it didn't help them,\" Medvedev said. \"They can go to sleep now.\" Alcaraz was asked how long he'll stew over this setback. \"Days? Weeks? I don't know,\" he responded. \"I don't think I'm going to think about this loss for a long time.\" ESPN Stats & Information and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 05:21:44", "image_url": null, "source_id": "espn", "source_priority": 18, "country": ["united kingdom", "singapore", "united states of america", "australia", "india", "canada"], "category": ["sports"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "ccf569832bb1a8aaeddf9b71f57275bd", "title": "3 Under-the-Radar Stocks to Invest In for Big-Time, Long-Term Gains", "link": "https://investorplace.com/2023/09/3-under-the-radar-stocks-to-invest-in-for-big-time-long-term-gains/", "keywords": ["Stocks to Buy", "NYSE:HWM", "NYSE:SN", "NYSE:RHI", "Stocks to Buy"], "creator": ["Jeremy Flint"], "video_url": null, "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Under-the-radar stocks with long-term potential are a goldmine for investors, but it's sometimes hard separating the signal from the noise.

At the same time, markets are complex and the depth of information available is overwhelming. \u201cParalysis by analysis\u201d is a real affliction. It particularly affects newer investors as they learn how to separate the wheat from the chaff in under-the-radar stocks. As with any long-term investment strategy, three things matter. First, consider the broad economic conditions. Today, in an era of high(ish) interest rates and economic uncertainty, growth stocks and tech stocks are struggling. Depending on your risk appetite, this can present an opportunity to buy great stocks at bargain prices. Second, underlying fundamentals and financials matter \u2013 particularly in a tight economy. If a company can\u2019t withstand brief uncertainty based on its current financials, it doesn\u2019t matter how great its potential is. To that end, consider the long-term potential. Does the company have a viable product or service that\u2019s in demand and fairly protected from competition? These three companies have fundamental strength and long-term viability to weather (or even thrive) in today\u2019s economy. Each represents a perfect under-the-radar stock for those hunting for overlooked treasure. Under-the-Radar Stocks: Howmet Aerospace (HWM) Howmet Aerospace (NYSE: HWM ) is an aerospace company that manufactures and produces various materials and components for aircraft and aerospace end items. Of course, with space stocks set to hit a net value between $1 trillion and $10 trillion in the next few years, Howmet\u2019s long-term viability as a partner to major aerospace companies is clear. Today, Howmet ensures operational success through diversified products in the trucking industry. As global companies race to tighten up strained supply lines, trucking is a vital link in the chain. Likewise, by producing components for the trucks themselves, Howmet is vital to operational success even as trucking companies pivot to unmanned and autonomous operations . Howmet is financially successful and posted a profit in each of the past three years , with its most recent quarter marking a record $193 million net income . Its cash balance is also healthy, and the aerospace company has enough money to weather occasional down periods if they arise. SharkNinja (SN) SharkNinja (NYSE: SN ) is the definition of an under-the-radar stock, as it snuck onto exchanges via a spinoff in July to limited investor attention. The company might not be at the top of market players\u2019 minds, but it\u2019s a staple in kitchens and homes globally. The company makes and sells a range of appliances, including coffee makers, ice cream machines and hair dryers. Although firmly within consumer discretionary categories, the sluggish economy hasn\u2019t slowed SharkNinja. Instead, the company\u2019s sales have risen 20% each year since 2008. This year, management expects the trends to continue as trends point to $4 billion in revenue by December. Shares trade at a discount compared to similar, semi-luxury appliance brand competitors. Institutional investors are slowly taking note because of the company\u2019s broad appeal, proven strategy and financial readiness. One portfolio manager from Madison Avenue Partners said that SharkNinja is \u201ca gem that\u2019s about to be discovered,\u201d because \u201cSharkNinja has been able to produce new products in categories that haven\u2019t seen much innovation at attractive prices that delight consumers.\u201d Ultimately, any company able to sell higher-end discretionary products in today\u2019s economy is noteworthy. SharkNinja\u2019s success points to long-term upside potential for this under-the-radar stock. Robert Half Inc (RHI) The global job and labor market is changing, and firms like staffing agency Robert Half Inc (NYSE: RHI ) are positioned to ride the new trend to success. Notably, the company is pivoting away from low-margin activities, like temporary staffing solutions, and rotating into long-term contract sourcing. Notably, contract-to-hire models represent much higher margins for Robert Half. At the same time, they ensure a long-term revenue stream as the client and contractor\u2019s relationship matures. Likewise, these roles open opportunities for Robert Half to partner with more professional, skilled and experienced contractors. Ultimately, the move increases value to the client\u2019s organization and cements RHI\u2019s position in their workflow. Small business outsourcing is already booming, and digitization means Robert Half can deliver expertise to small business owners globally, no matter how remote the business is or how lacking local talent pools are. This demand makes matchmaking essential, and Robert Half is particularly well-suited to capitalize on emerging trends. This company and the ones listed above are all under-the-radar stocks that you should consider for your portfolio.

Each of them is armed with small stacks of documents and manila folders, and most are on their second or third trip to the Yellowstone County Office of Public Assistance where they are trying to restore the services they lost during the Medicaid unwinding. The \u201cunwinding\u201d describes the massive, federally mandated, reprocessing of every Medicaid recipient in the United States. It comes at the end of the three-year COVID-19 public health emergency, during which Congress enacted a requirement that states relax parameters around Medicaid eligibility. Medicaid programs were required to keep people continuously enrolled through the end of the emergency in exchange for enhanced federal funding. As a result, no one was reevaluated for Medicaid for three years, even if there was an increase in income or access to other health insurance. By the time the continuous enrollment requirement ended on March 31, 2023, there were more than 320,000 Montanans enrolled in Medicaid. Workers at the state health department will need to process every individual to either re-enroll them, or if they are no longer eligible bump them off the public insurance. So far, 55,000 people have lost coverage since April. Many unaware they're dropped After five months of unwinding, the redetermination process is going horribly across the country, including in Montana, said Mary Windecker, CEO of Behavioral Health Alliance of Montana. State data shows that 1,638 renewal packets were returned in the mail due to an incorrect address for the target individual and nearly 34,000 people lost coverage because of failure to provide requested information. Most people don\u2019t know that they\u2019ve fallen off Medicaid until they arrive in a provider\u2019s office, Windecker said. Amanda Medina has been trying for a month to get her children re-enrolled in Medicaid. She\u2019s waited on hold for hours just to be redirected to another department. She\u2019s receive contradictory information at every turn and taken at least two days off work to stand in line at the OPA. Her daughter has unique health issues that require treatment at the Children\u2019s Hospital in Denver, Colorado. \u201cShe has an appointment in October. I can\u2019t imagine if we got there and didn\u2019t have insurance,\u201d Medina said. Without Medicaid, Medina would run the risk of having to pay the full amount of the service out of pocket. Medina was aware that the unwinding was happening, but missed her redetermination paperwork in the mail. What she didn\u2019t realize was that her children would be affected by the unwinding. \u201cThere\u2019s lack of communication between departments. (Medicaid) has always been a headache, but this is a disaster,\u201d Medina said. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a pattern as to who falls through the cracks and who may be automatically re-enrolled, said Erica Schuppe, occupational therapist and owner of Wild Roots Therapy in Billings. Schuppe and her team of therapists spent at least six hours combing through their list of Medicaid patients, checking their enrollment status online, and calling the patient if they were listed as inactive. \u201cThe man power we\u2019ve put into this \u2026 I don\u2019t think smaller practices would be able to do it. And a lot of those practices in rural Montana are small,\u201d Schuppe said. Wild Roots offers occupational therapy, speech therapy, integrated listening systems and counseling with a focus on serving kids on Medicaid. The bulk of her clientele have experienced early life adversity such as abuse, neglect or exposure to violence. As these kids get older, they often present with, broadly speaking, behavioral problems. Schuppe has made it her mission to serve this patient population. She has never capped the number of Medicaid patients she takes, like many other providers. She has never sorted her waitlist by insurance. At least not until now. July was the first time in her career that she started looking for clients with private insurance, and it\u2019s because the state health department has been six-to-eight weeks behind on processing Medicaid claims since the unwinding began. The state government reimburses providers at a fixed rate for services delivered to a Medicaid recipient. In the past, the claims were processed and payment distributed in a timely manner, making it so Schuppe could continue on her mission. But with at least 180 Medicaid patients in the books per week, Schuppe can\u2019t afford to take anymore. \u201cI didn\u2019t fill my open spots with Medicaid patients, and it made me feel sick. It goes against my values, but I have 12 employees I have to pay,\u201d Schuppe said. At the same time, a multitude of claims are being denied because of noncompliance with the Passport to Health Program. This Medicaid program works to strengthen the relationship between a patient and a provider. The patient chooses one provider to manage all their referrals, and in order for the state government to pay for the service, the claim documentation must indicate that the Passport provider gave the referral. This program was suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the state health department did not adequately inform providers that the program would start back up this year, according to Schuppe. \u201cNo one was notified. Doctors weren\u2019t, therapists weren\u2019t, families weren\u2019t. These doctors are getting hundreds of calls a day now for referrals ... No one knew that this hiccup existed,\u201d Schuppe said. Providers throughout the state are capping the number of Medicaid patients they take. Others refuse to accept the public insurance at all. Families who have fallen off Medicaid have discontinued treatments for their children, Schuppe said. They don\u2019t want to accumulate medical debt in case they\u2019re unable to get back on Medicaid. During the final weeks of summer Schuppe usually focuses on getting her clients ready for the school year, working hard on things like fine motor skills and emotional regulation. But because of the Medicaid disruptions, many kids missed out on this. \u201cBeing unsafe as a little kid creates a plethora of developmental issues. That\u2019s why they come here, to get help with that,\u201d Schuppe said. \u201cSo to have additional stressors put on families is very sad to me.\u201d Jackie Jones, director of Montana government relations for PacificSource Health Plans, recalled a letter sent by the state health department to every Medicaid recipient in the state and the panic that followed. State officials aimed to inform enrollees of a different change to Medicaid, a change that is completely separate from the unwinding. \u201cThe letter was confusing, even for me,\u201d Jones said. \u201cPeople panicked, they thought they missed (the unwinding).\u201d The letter addressed the end of continuous eligibility, which keeps Medicaid recipients enrolled for 12-months before they are reevaluated. During the 2021 legislative session, state lawmakers voted to remove funding for continuous eligibility. Now, most adults covered by Medicaid will need to send proof of income to the state health department more frequently. This change, however, will not affect children. Between the unwinding and the end of continuous eligibility, there has been a misunderstanding around re-enrolling children for Medicaid, Jones said. Parents will need to return redetermination packets for their children in order to stay on Medicaid, but once the application is accepted, the kids will be covered for a year. \u201cWe all need to become helpers in getting services to people,\u201d Jones said, calling on others to help friends and family get their paperwork together and submitted. The most important thing to do now, Jones said, is to know the status of your Medicaid enrollment. Recipients can check online at . The website will show when the recipient should expect to see their redetermination packet in the mail. Contact information and addresses should be up-to-date online too. Upon receiving the packet, individuals will have about 30 days to return the information to the state health department. Even if the packet doesn\u2019t get in the mail right on time, Jones says to send in the information anyway. If it\u2019s close to the final day, the department might just process it anyway. For those who are no longer eligible because their employer offers health insurance benefits, there will open a temporary enrollment period in which you can apply for private insurance without a life changing event. A local group called partnered with the state health department to help people through the unwinding process.

Imagine having your own supply of fresh, homegrown buds easily accessible to you. Whether you\u2019re a beginner or a seasoned grower looking to take your cannabis cultivation to the next level, this guide has got you covered. From choosing the right seeds to watching buds grow, we\u2019ll walk you through the exciting process of growing cannabis from seed to potent marijuana. Before we dive right into cannabis cultivation, it\u2019s crucial to understand the very foundation of it all \u2013 cannabis seeds. We\u2019ll cover the different types of seeds, the variety of strains, germination methods, and stages of growth. When it comes to regular weed seeds, you\u2019re in for a mix of possibilities. The sprouted seeds can grow into male or female weed plants, offering a variety of outcomes. Identifying and removing male plants is important to ensure your female plants can grow without interruptions. Regular weed seeds are great for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. Additionally, their steady growth pace makes them a good enough balance for both beginners and experienced growers alike. Regular cannabis seeds are perfect if you\u2019re interested in doing some experimentation, including creating your own unique strains. For those looking for simplicity and efficiency, are the best choice. These weed seeds guarantee only female plants, eliminating the need to identify male plants and remove them. Feminized weed seeds also grow cannabis a lot quicker compared to regular weed seeds. This makes feminized weed seeds a great choice for beginners and those aiming for a successful yield coupled with certainty and convenience, whether they\u2019re grown indoors or in a greenhouse. If patience isn\u2019t your strong suit, you may want to consider using . These weed seeds do not require specific light cycles to start flowering. They\u2019re compact in size, making them ideal for tight spaces and perfect for indoor cultivation. Newer growers will appreciate their low-maintenance nature, which means less stress and more buds. Photoperiod cannabis seeds require a touch of patience, control, and attention. With these seeds, you can manipulate the light cycles to your own advantage, guiding the weed plants through different stages of growth. While they demand a bit more of your attention, photoperiod seeds are likely to result in a variety of strains, each with its own unique flavor and effects. This choice is perfect for advanced to expert growers looking to create their own customized strains. Sour Diesel offers around 20% THC with a citrusy, fuel-like flavor. Its energetic effects include a burst of artistic ideas, an energy boost, and increased sociability, making it ideal for daytime use. It\u2019s favored by those seeking a pick-me-up during busy days, social gatherings, or creative sessions. In addition, Sour Diesel\u2019s THC content can also aid in managing stress and anxiety. White Widow has a balanced hybrid nature, with approximately 19% THC and a smooth, earthy flavor with a hint of sweetness. This strain delivers a joyful yet relaxing experience. This strain is best for winding down after a long day or enjoying a chill night with friends. Its moderate THC level makes it a recommended strain for beginners looking for relaxation without overwhelming effects. Blue Dream, containing around 18% THC, delivers relaxation and euphoria. This strain is versatile, making it suitable for daytime or evening use. It has a fruity and berry-like flavor profile, contributing to the overall experience. Blue Dream is a great choice for those seeking a balanced high without intense effects. OG Kush, a potent strain with roughly 20% THC, is best suited for experienced users, particularly those looking to relax. It has a distinct earthy and piney flavor with a hint of lemon. Because of its high THC content, it\u2019s not the most beginner-friendly option. It\u2019s best for evening use due to the soothing experience it offers. Gelato is a hybrid strain with around 20% THC that\u2019s generally great for both beginners and seasoned users. It has a sweet dessert-like flavor and provides a relaxed state and improved mood. Gelato is versatile and great for morning or evening use whenever you need a balanced, calming, and uplifting high. Northern Lights, containing around 18% THC, is an excellent choice for beginners seeking composure and tranquility. It has a sweet and spicy taste, with some options having a hint of pine and earthy flavors. Northern Lights offers a calming high that promotes relaxation and good sleep and is best enjoyed in the evening. AK-47, a Sativa-dominant hybrid strain with approximately 17% THC, is recommended for experienced users, particularly those seeking an energy boost. This makes it suitable for daytime use. It has a sweet and floral aroma and delivers an invigorating high that makes one more social, focused, and creative. Maui Wowie, with approximately 20% THC, provides a creative and mood-boosting experience. Ideal for both beginners and experienced users, this Sativa strain features a tropical and citrusy flavor and is best enjoyed during the day. Its flavor profile reminds users of pineapples and mangos, living up to its tropical name and source, with traces of origin strains from the island of Hawaii. Trainwreck is a Sativa strain that contains around 18% THC, with a sweet lemon and spicy, earthy flavor that matches its intense effects. It gives its users a rush of powerful euphoria and creativity, perfect for use during the day. Trainwreck encourages social interactions with its energetic effects. It provides potential therapeutic effects as well, relieving chronic pain and discomfort. Blue Cheese contains around 19% THC and is used for a mellow high that improves mood and encourages relaxation. It has a pungent aroma, similar to blue cheese, with a flavor that combines cheese and blueberry. Enjoy it in the evening as you wind down and destress. It\u2019s also known to help with sleep due to its calming effects. Exploring the world of growing cannabis seeds entails learning about and \u2013 two distinct strains that offer unique experiences for the user. Indica strains, commonly associated with relaxation, come from mountainous regions and thrive in colder climates. These compact weed plants feature broad leaves and hold the promise of delivering soothing effects. Indica strains are ideal for unwinding after a long and tiring day and for finding relief and comfort. On the other hand, Sativa strains hail from equatorial regions, growing their best in warm environments. Unlike the compact leaves of Indica, Sativa grows tall, narrow leaves and delivers invigorating effects. Sativa strains spark creativity, encourage sociability, improve mood, and boost energy. It\u2019s ideal for daytime use, giving a productive day a good kick-start. While Indica and Sativa strains are polar opposites, hybrid strains stand in the middle and offer a blend of both worlds. Hybrids inherit characteristics from their parent strains, resulting in a fusion of relaxation and energy. Their effects vary depending on the more dominant parent strain, opening up opportunities for customized cannabis experiences. When growing marijuana of different strains, keep their specific temperature needs in mind. Indica strains prefer cooler climates and tend to have shorter flowering periods, while Sativa strains like warmer temperatures and demand more patience due to their longer flowering cycles. Hybrids are a bit more challenging, requiring more attentive care due to their mixed traits. Usually, beginners tend to choose Indica strains for easier cultivation, while advanced growers lean toward Sativa strains. Additionally, seasoned growers with a lot of experience may test their skills with hybrids. Growing weed is an exciting journey with various stages that turn tiny seeds into thriving plants. It all begins with germination, where cannabis seeds wake up and start to grow roots. This phase takes about a few days to a week. The seeds soak up water, crack open their shells, and send roots down into the soil. Once the roots sprout, the cannabis seedling stage begins. In about 2 to 3 weeks, your plant grows its first real leaves alongside its tiny initial ones. This helps lay a strong foundation for the next stage, which is the vegetative stage. The vegetative stage lasts about 3 to 16 weeks. During this time, your cannabis plant focuses on growing leaves and stems. Giving it enough light and nutrients ensures the leaves are healthy and the plant is sturdy. After that, pre-flowering kicks in and lasts about 1 to 2 weeks. This is when you can tell if your plant is male or female. Female plants show tiny pistils, while males have pollen sacs. The most exciting part is flowering, which goes on for 6 to 12 weeks. The plant shifts its energy from growing to making buds, setting the stage for a great harvest. Remember, it\u2019s all about patience and careful attention throughout these stages. Keeping an eye on light, nutrients, and the environment makes sure your weed plants thrive. Above anything else, it\u2019s important to select high-quality seeds. Look for cannabis seeds that are plump, firm, and have a dark color. A healthy cannabis seed will have a slightly glossy appearance and feel solid to the touch. If your seeds are cracked, damaged, or too light in color, they might not germinate successfully. Opt for reputable cannabis seed banks or breeders to increase the likelihood of obtaining viable seeds that have been properly stored. Once you have your weed seeds ready, it\u2019s time to choose a germination method. There are several options to choose from: This popular method among beginners and seasoned growers alike involves placing weed seeds between damp paper towels and enclosing them in a plastic bag to let the seeds germinate. This creates a warm and humid environment ideal for germination. Check the paper towels regularly to ensure they remain moist but not soaked. Within a few days, you should see roots emerge, indicating successful germination. With this method, submerge your cannabis seeds in a glass of distilled water and let them soak. After about 24 to 48 hours, the seeds should sink to the bottom. This is your signal that they\u2019re ready to be planted. Putting the seeds in transparent water glasses helps you watch their development more closely. This approach is simple yet effective, making it a favorite among growers of all levels. Another option is to plant your cannabis seeds directly into your chosen growing medium. Ensure that the soil is adequately moist but not drenched in water. This method minimizes the risk of damaging delicate sprouts during the transplanting process, letting your seeds germinate in the final medium. Creating the right environment for germination is also crucial. Learn more about different environmental factors to consider below: Maintain a stable temperature of around 70-85\u00b0F to encourage optimal germination rates. Slight variations are acceptable, but drastic temperature changes can hinder or disrupt the whole process. Cannabis seeds do not require light to germinate; in fact, darkness often aids the process. However, once the roots emerge, providing gentle light will help prevent the seedlings from becoming weak. A humid environment promotes seed hydration and germination. A plastic bag or humidity dome can help maintain the necessary moisture levels during the initial stages. Keep in mind that there\u2019s a moisture level that you want to maintain, making sure that your seeds are not too dry or too damp. A big contributor to success is choosing the right growing medium. Soil, the traditional option, provides a forgiving environment for plants. On the other hand, hydroponics grants precise control over nutrient and water delivery. Coco coir, a natural fiber from coconut husks, combines water retention and aeration properties, making it an excellent alternative. Additionally, soilless mixes, composed of ingredients like perlite and vermiculite, provide improved drainage and aeration. Providing light to your weed plants effectively is essential for photosynthesis. Modern LED lights, known for energy efficiency and versatility, are favored by many growers. They emit specific light spectra that cater to different growth stages, promoting healthier and stronger marijuana. High-pressure sodium (HPS) lights shine during the flowering stage, giving a warm spectrum that enhances bud development. Compact Fluorescent Lights (CFL), affordable and suitable for smaller setups, are great for seedlings and young plants. Metal Halide (MH) lights are also popular and best for vegetative growth due to their blue spectrum. Maintaining optimal airflow. Installing ventilation systems, fans, and air filters may help establish a healthy growing environment for your marijuana. Inline fans expel stale air, while intake fans bring in fresh air. Carbon filters neutralize odors, which is essential for discreet cultivation. Climate control tools like heaters and dehumidifiers play a big role in maintaining consistent conditions throughout the growth stages, protecting plants from stress and diseases. Germination, being the very first step in your cannabis cultivation journey, is a critical process that sets the stage for healthy growth. The step-by-step process below ensures that your cannabis seeds get the best possible start. First, carefully select viable cannabis seeds that are plump, firm, and dark in color. These are the usual signs of healthy seeds that are more likely to germinate successfully. Once you\u2019ve gathered your cannabis seeds, you\u2019ll need some basic materials, depending on your germination method of choice. Over the next few days, you\u2019ll start to see tiny white taproots emerging from the germinated seeds. Once these taproots reach a length of around 0.5 to 0.75 inches, they\u2019re ready for the next stage. Carefully transfer the germinated cannabis seeds, taproot side down, into your chosen growing medium. This could be soil, coco coir, or any other suitable medium. To aid in their development, maintain a light cycle of 18 to 24 hours during germination, depending on the specific needs of your chosen cannabis seeds. This encourages the seedlings to stretch and establish themselves. As they grow, you\u2019ll witness the first signs of the true leaves, marking the beginning of your plants\u2019 journey. The phase after germinating cannabis seeds is a critical time for your seedlings. Providing attentive care during this period ensures that your seedlings establish strong roots for healthy growth. As your seedlings develop their first set of true leaves, it\u2019s time to consider their transition to larger containers. Transplanting provides them with more space for root expansion and growth. Choose containers with ample drainage holes to prevent overwatering. Gently lift the seedlings from their current medium, being careful not to damage the delicate roots. Place them in the new container at the same depth as before and fill in. This process reduces the risk of transplant shock. During the seedling stage, your weed plants will require specific nutrients for healthy growth. Opt for a balanced seedling nutrient mix with a higher proportion of nitrogen. Nitrogen supports the development of vibrant green leaves and robust stems. Begin with weaker doses of nutrients and gradually increase the strength as your seedlings grow. Overfeeding can lead to nutrient burn, so monitor your weed plants closely for any signs of stress or imbalance. Proper light and watering play huge roles in your seedlings\u2019 overall well-being. Maintain a gentle light intensity to prevent stretching stems. Research the specific light requirements of your chosen cannabis plant seeds to be informed about what\u2019s an optimal environment for them. Seedlings are prone to overwatering, so water carefully and in smaller quantities. Keep the growing medium slightly moist, allowing the top layer to dry out slightly between waterings. A spray bottle can be handy for misting seedlings, maintaining humidity, and preventing overwatering. It\u2019s inevitable to face certain challenges when cultivating marijuana, but being well-prepared and informed equips you to overcome them with confidence. The battle against pests and diseases is a constant one. Aphids, spider mites, and fungi like powdery mildew can all cause great damage to your cannabis plants. Regular inspection is key. Utilize integrated pest management techniques, including introducing beneficial insects to combat pests naturally. Neem oil and other organic treatments can also scare off invaders without harming your weed plants or compromising their end product. Your plants\u2019 health also relies on proper nutrient balance. Pale leaves and hindered growth could indicate nutrient deficiencies. Moreover, nutrient excesses can manifest in burnt leaf tips or an overly dark appearance. Be vigilant in monitoring your weed plants and adjust your nutrient regimen as needed. Investing in a quality nutrient solution that aligns with your plants\u2019 growth stages can also significantly reduce such risks. Environmental stressors, such as temperature fluctuations, humidity changes, and poor air circulation, can also lead to growth setbacks. Optimal conditions foster healthy development, so invest in reliable climate control systems. A combination of fans, heaters, and dehumidifiers helps maintain a stable environment. The legality of growing cannabis varies depending on the laws governing your region. Research and understand the laws and regulations on cannabis cultivation that apply in your area. Complying with local guidelines not only protects you from legal troubles but also contributes to being a responsible member of your community. It\u2019s also important to practice ethical and sustainable cultivation. Implement eco-friendly measures, such as composting, water conservation, and minimal use of synthetic chemicals, to reduce your environmental footprint. Safety is another primary consideration in the cultivation process. Establish fire prevention measures, especially if you\u2019re using high-intensity lighting systems. Properly ventilate your grow space to prevent mold growth and promote healthy air exchange. Moreover, working with cannabis plants may expose you to potential allergens and irritants. Wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves and eye protection, can mitigate health risks. Proper hygiene practices, such as washing hands thoroughly after handling plants, help to maintain a safe and healthy environment for both you and your plants. Properly dispose of plant waste and byproducts to prevent contamination and environmental harm. Composting plant material is an eco-friendly option. Lastly, cultivating cannabis plants may impact your neighbors and community. Remember to be respectful of their concerns and employ measures to minimize odors and disturbances.

The legality of growing marijuana at home may vary based on your jurisdiction. In some places, cultivating a limited number of weed plants for personal use is permitted, while others strictly prohibit home cultivation. It\u2019s crucial to research and understand your local laws and regulations on cultivation to be in the know about legal requirements before you grow cannabis. This ensures your safety and also contributes to responsible and ethical cultivation practices. The time it takes to grow marijuana from seed to harvest can vary depending on the strain, growing conditions, and cultivation techniques. Generally, it takes approximately 8 to 10 weeks for fast-flowering strains, while others may require up to 12 weeks or more. Note that autoflowering strains tend to have shorter growth periods, and some strains, particularly Sativas, may have longer flowering times. Regular monitoring and employing proper care practices throughout the growth stages play huge roles in achieving optimal yields and potent buds. For beginners, Indica-dominant strains are generally recommended as they have shorter flowering times and are less demanding in terms of attention. With sturdy structures, their growth traits are typically more forgiving. However, it\u2019s essential to remember that each strain has unique characteristics. While Indicas are generally the go-to choice in a broader sense, it\u2019s highly encouraged to conduct thorough research on specific strains before making a selection. Consider factors like growth requirements, effects, and potential challenges. Yes, you can grow cannabis seeds indoors in limited spaces.

Gemini currently has an F rating with the Better Business Bureau due to a failure to respond to multiple complaints, failure to resolve underlying causes for complaints, and the length of time the business takes to respond to a complaint. The BBB also notes that most complaints filed against Gemini after January 2021 were due to customers being unable to access bitcoin in their Gemini account. Many users also believe that Gemini's verification process for withdrawals and transfers slows transactions. In November 2022, Genesis stopped Gemini Earn investors from withdrawing crypto from their accounts due to Genesis' lack of sufficient liquid assets to meet withdrawal requests. The Gemini Earn program was then terminated . In February 2022, a Gemini crypto hack led to the loss of roughly $37 million in assets of clients with crypto IRAs held through IRA Financial Trust. IRA Financial Trust sued Gemini, and both Gemini and IRA Financial Trusts became the targets of client lawsuits. On January 12, 2023, the SEC charged a complaint against Genesis and Gemini, claiming unregistered offer and sale of securities to retail investors through the Earn program. As of September 2023, Gemini is pushing for a federal judge to dismiss SEC's claims for insufficient evidence. The charges are still pending. Is Coinbase Right for You?

It is hard to believe that it's been about 15 years since trading in bitcoin began. Crypto has exploded since then, with coins coming and going, not always quietly. IRS guidance from 2014 ( Notice 2014-21 ) says crypto is property, not currency. That means most transfers trigger taxes. You might be using it to pay for a new car, a cup of coffee or paying someone for services, either as an independent contractor or as an employee. But no matter what the transaction, you may have a gain or a loss. Whatever type or amount of crypto you use, the IRS will say you paid them the current market value of the crypto on that day. When you pay an independent contractor and issue a Form 1099, you can't enter a number of bitcoin on the form. You must put the value in U.S. dollars as of the time of payment. The contractor you pay might keep the crypto, or might sell it the same day, but that doesn't impact your taxes. The U.S. Treasury Department has proposed new rules to make it harder for people not to pay tax on their gains when they sell or trade crypto. Starting in 2026 for the 2025 tax year, crypto exchanges are required to report to the IRS and taxpayers in much the way brokerage firms now handle stock trades. The basic idea is that the crypto exchanges will send you and the IRS a Form 1099 keyed to your Social Security Number each year, reporting the total gross proceeds generated on your sales. You already get Form 1099 for many kinds of payments. They usually show up in your mailbox around Jan. 31, for the prior year. And if you receive a Form 1099 but don't put it on your tax return, it usually means that you'll get a tax bill from the IRS asking for their cut. The new reporting rules are not reporting your gain, mind you, but the gross amount in dollars your transactions represent. If you held your crypto for over a year to get long term capital gain treatment on your gains, the IRS tax rate is up to 23.8%. In contrast, if your gain is ordinary, the tax hit is up to 37%. Depending on where you live, you need to consider state taxes too. But how about your tax basis, who keeps track of that? The answer is that you have to. But the IRS and Treasury Department are thinking about this too. In addition to reporting gross proceeds starting in January 2026 for 2025 sales, the crypto exchanges will also have to start reporting your purchase price too\u2014your basis. That will make it even easier for the IRS to send you a tax bill if you forget to report your gain yourself. The new basis reporting kicks in early in 2027, when reporting sales made in 2026. But the rules would reach back only to crypto purchased in 2023 or later. But still, you can probably assume that there will be lots of zero basis reporting as these rules take effect. Is all this shocking? Hardly. The IRS has been after crypto for a long while now, even before 2014. But the IRS has had a hard time coming out with guidance, a hard time training its personnel how to audit crypto, and what to do with questionable cases. What if neither you nor your exchange know your tax basis? Maybe you bought your crypto long ago, and just don't know. Maybe it was a gift from your uncle Joe, but you don't know what he paid for it. Under IRS tax rules, when you receive property by gift, you take a carryover basis, meaning the basis that the giver of the property had. That way, if the person who made the gift has a low basis, you do too\u2014which will yield a bigger tax bite on your gain when you sell it. If your exchange doesn't know your basis, they will likely say zero basis. And that is the IRS rule too. If you can't prove your basis to the IRS, the IRS will assume that your basis is zero. \u00a9 Copyright IBTimes 2023. All rights reserved.
