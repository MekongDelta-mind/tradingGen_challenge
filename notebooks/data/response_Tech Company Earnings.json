The post 3 Cybersecurity Stocks to Invest In for Big-Time, Long-Term Gains appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "content": "Did cybersecurity companies win second-quarter earnings season? It certainly appears that way after nearly all of the leading cybersecurity companies beat Wall Street forecasts, sending their share prices up 10% or more as a result. While mega-cap tech stocks posted mixed Q2 results, and disappointing retailers complained about in-store theft, cybersecurity firms hit one homerun after another on growing demand for their products and services. Cybersecurity remains one of the fastest growing areas of technology right now. Consulting firm McKinsey & Co. sees a $2 trillion market for cybersecurity as businesses and individuals worldwide increasingly rely on more sophisticated products to protect them from cyberattacks, identity theft, and to manage access to their various electronic devices. Now viewed as a necessary business expense, spending on cybersecurity is likely to only accelerate in coming years. Here are three cybersecurity stocks to buy and hold right now. Palo Alto Networks (PANW) Shares of Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW ) jumped 12% at the end of August as the cybersecurity company issued financial results that were much better than expected on Wall Street. It was a relief rally of sorts as PANW stock declined 16% leading up to Q2 print and investors worried that the company\u2019s decision to announce its results after markets closed on a Friday was a sign of problems. Not so, as it turned out. Palo Alto Networks reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.44 versus $1.28 that had been expected by analysts who cover the company. Revenue in the quarter ended July 31 totaled $1.95 billion versus $1.96 billion that was anticipated. Revenue rose 26% from a year earlier as demand for the company\u2019s cybersecurity products grows stronger. While the company\u2019s forward guidance came in softer than analysts would have liked, the overall view appears to be that Palo Alto Networks remains a leading cybersecurity concern. PANW stock has now risen 75% this year and is up 220% over five years. CrowdStrike (CRWD) Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: CRWD ) is another among the cybersecurity stocks to buy and hold now. It too reported better-than-expected results at the end of August, sending its share price higher as well. The company announced Q2 EPS of 74 cents, which was far ahead of Wall Street\u2019s consensus forecast of 56 cents. Revenue during Q2 came in at $731.6 million, up 37% from a year ago. That too was ahead of analyst expectations of $724.1 million. Free cash flow stood at $188.7 million at the quarter\u2019s end, up 39% from $135.8 million a year earlier. Looking ahead, CrowdStrike said it expects revenue of $775.4 million to $778 million and 74 cents in earnings for the current third quarter. Wall Street had been looking for $774 million in revenue and 60 cents in profits for the current third quarter. Analysts and investors had nothing to quibble about regarding the Q2 results and forward guidance. Consequently, CRWD stock has risen nearly 10% in recent weeks even as the broader market has pulled back. CrowdStrike\u2019s shares have now gained 60% this year and are up 157% through five years. Okta (OKTA) Rounding out the parade of strong earnings, we have Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA ). The company\u2019s share price vaulted 10% higher immediately after it reported its latest financial results. The company, which specializes in identity verification and access management, posted Q2 EPS of 31 cents on revenue of $556 million. Analysts who track the company had penciled in earnings of 22 cents on revenue of $535 million. Okta also raised its guidance and provided a strong outlook for both Q3 and all of this year, leading investors to cheer. Okta, which uses cloud identification software that enables people to access multiple platforms with a single sign-on, said it is benefitting from the successful integration of several acquisitions it made over the last few years. The improved financials and positive guidance led many analysts on Wall Street to revise up their targets on OKTA stock, with investment bank Guggenheim Securities lifting its target on the share price to $100 from $96 previously. OKTA stock has gained 26% this year and is up 22% over the past five years.

What Happened: A woman identified by the pseudonym Guan Yue orchestrated a labor fraud scheme amassing nearly $7 million, Chinese newspaper Xinmin reported. Guan meticulously documented her employment details on paper and would share pictures from her job interviews on her work channels, pretending to be engaged with clients, according to the outlet. When the number of job offers became unmanageable, Guan reportedly delegated the roles to acquaintances, retaining a portion of the earnings as commission. The proceeds from the operation, which she conducted with her husband, were substantial enough to purchase an apartment in Shanghai, and were funneled through various bank accounts, Xinmin reported. The intricate fraud came undone in January, after an internet-tech CEO by the pseudonym Liu Jian noticed an employee inadvertently revealing his employment at another firm while working for the CEO. This led to the discovery of a larger group involved in the scheme, including its leader identified as Yang Hong . Following a police investigation, a total of 53 individuals were apprehended. Also Read: Workplace Wisdom: Lessons In Happiness From A 90-Year-Old With A 74-Year Career At Dillard's According to Xinmin, this kind of labor fraud is rampant in China. An estimated 700 to 800 groups of scammers have secured jobs using counterfeit resumes and passing interviews. The groups have reportedly become proficient in navigating employment laws to avoid criminal charges, often settling disputes through arbitration. In one notable instance, a group even managed to infiltrate a company by having one of its members hired as the HR representative, who subsequently facilitated the employment of other group members. While the latest case has brought this issue to the forefront, it highlights a significant challenge in China's corporate sector , raising questions about the efficacy of the hiring process and the extent of labor fraud in the country.

The post META Stock Outlook: 3 Catalysts That Could Fuel Meta Platform\u2019s Next Rally appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) had a turbulent 2022, plunging from a high of roughly $380 per share to the $88 level, and then more than tripling in early 2023. At around $300 per share at the time of writing, META stock has certainly become one of the come back stories investors like to see. Those who have held this stock through the turbulence are none the worse for the wear, especially if those same investors bought the stock years ago. Of course, n ews often mirrors stock performance, and it\u2019s crucial to remember the negative headlines about Meta during its decline. Now, optimism abounds for many large-cap tech stocks . That said, investors must consider whether it\u2019s overvalued or rightfully bullish after its roughly 10% decline from its recent peak. Here are three catalysts I think are worth watching when it comes to Meta right now. Meta Platforms is Being Re-Rated Higher Among 42 analysts , 40 rate Mets Platforms stock as \u201cbuy,\u201d with none issuing a recent \u201csell\u201d rating, despite its August decline. Analysts, like Scott Devitt from Wedbush, see potential in Meta\u2019s job cuts leading to improved margins. Devitt notes enhanced monetization in newer areas like Reels and click-to-message ads, setting a $350 price target for META stock. Similarly, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) analysts, with a $375 price target, anticipate renewed enthusiasm for Meta\u2019s stock in 2024 once spending targets are clearer. As more analysts jump on Meta Platforms as a potential long-term opportunity, I expect more price target hikes and upgrades on the horizon. Strong Fundamentals Meta stands out in the tech sector with just 21.6% of its capitalization comprised of debt, a modest figure compared to other tech firms. Meta\u2019s free cash flow, around $24 billion this year , surpasses its total debt of approximately $37 billion, a rarity in the corporate world. This robust cash flow has allowed Meta to repurchase 101 million of its own shares in the past year, benefiting shareholders and boosting stock prices. Meta\u2019s return on invested capital (or ROIC) historically ranged from 15% to 20%, ensuring that the money used for stock buybacks generates similar returns for shareholders. While criticism exists for Meta\u2019s investment in the metaverse, which has yet to yield expected profits, it has lowered ROIC to 14%, still strong compared to many companies. Meta\u2019s robust fundamentals extend to its market share, with Facebook commanding 53.1% of all social media visits (excluding Instagram). This significant presence offers multiple avenues for monetization, irrespective of the metaverse\u2019s success. AI Is The Main Near-Term Catalyst Meta Platforms understands the need for substantial investments in specific areas. It\u2019s a manageable challenge as long as the company can maintain strong revenue growth. While Q2 2023 showed an 11% year-over-year revenue increase, the focus now shifts to what will drive revenue growth in the latter half of 2023 and 2024. Meta Platforms is said to be working on an AI bot for enhancing business customer service and an internal AI tool designed to boost staff productivity. Of course, given the attention around artificial intelligence of late, this has garnered some attention. That said, over the longer-term, we\u2019ll have to see how this actually impacts the company\u2019s bottom line (if it\u2019s more or less like Meta\u2019s move into the metaverse, for example). What Now for Meta Platforms? While Meta shifts its focus to Threads and monetizing Instagram/WhatsApp, the metaverse project might lose some prominence. However, analysts expect double-digit earnings per share growth (around 26.7%) over the next twelve months, which could propel the stock higher, given the historical link between EPS and stock prices. Consider the potential if they redirect metaverse spending is redirected elsewhere, possibly restoring ROIC to its historical levels. This could result in more substantial share buybacks and higher analyst targets due to improved monetization and ROIC. Investors should seize this opportunity.

At the event, we will also announce 25 top game startups as the 2024 Game Changers. Apply or nominate today ! Brian Ward, CEO of Savvy Games Group , has taken the lead in helping Saudi Arabia\u2019s attempt to move beyond its reputation for human rights abuses and being an oil nation to being a visionary technology leader bankrolling the game industry. This tension between the past and the future is ever-present in Saudi Arabia, where companies like Savvy Games Group \u2014 owned by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia \u2014 are trying to change perceptions through games while remaining cognizant of the kingdom\u2019s appetite for measured change. Ward believes people have to see the change happening in society on the ground in Saudi Arabia in order to understand how quickly things can happen under the new regime that is mostly supportive of the game industry. There is perhaps no other country where the clash between tradition and modernity \u2014 something my world history professor talked about so long ago \u2014 is so stark. The change and the deals have been happening at a dizzying rate. It\u2019s like a big game of Monopoly, and the playing board of the game industry is set up on a global scale. Savvy Games Group acquired Los Angeles-based mobile game publisher Scopely for $4.9 billion in April, and it bought a $1 billion stake in Sweden-based game publisher Embracer Group. It also acquired ESL Gaming and FaceIt in esports to create ESL FaceIt Group. And the Saudis have also bought stakes in Capcom, Nexon and Nintendo this year, building on stakes it acquired previously in Activision Blizzard, Take-Two Interactive and Electronic Arts. That has made the gaming world take notice. Savvy\u2019s big stakeholder, the Public Investment Fund (run by the Saudi Arabian government) is flush with cash from the oil boom and it has set aside $37.8 billion to build up Saudi Arabia\u2019s presence in the global games industry \u2013 with $13.3 billion of that earmarked for acquiring a major publisher. That\u2019s more money than anyone around the world is earmarking for gaming investments and acquisitions. It\u2019s a sign that the government is serious about weaning the country from oil. The Saudi Vision 2030 is a government program launched by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to diversify economically, socially and culturally, in line with the vision of bin Salman. The Saudis announced it in 2016, but the country remained about 74% dependent on oil exports as of 2021. The country understands that the oil economy could dry up in the next 27 years, and it has to have other jobs ready \u2014 and they are trickling in so far. For the games industry, this influx of Saudi money into games is not without controversy, as the Saudi funding is controversial and the company has only been at it since November 2021. Critics say that the regime of Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud doesn\u2019t respect human rights. As crown prince and prime minister, he was connected to the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 via alleged killers who had ties to the crown prince. Accepting funding from the Saudis under such a regime represents a moral quandary, as the Saudis have become a big source of funding in their efforts to diversify beyond their dependence on oil, which the world is in the process of moving away from in pursuit of clean energy. Saudi defenders say that all major sources of money in the world are tainted in some way, and accepting money from the Saudis does not mean you have to accept interference from the Saudis or embrace their agenda. Ward pointed out in an interview with GamesBeat that the country is undergoing change when it comes to women\u2019s rights and other freedoms, and it is serious about creating transformative results when it comes to diversity and new jobs associated with game studios. Still, given the fact that being gay is illegal in Saudi Arabia, The Last of Us Part 2 was banned in the country for having gay women in its leading roles. Ward has said the company aims to become a great games company and is not tied to a specific political agenda and he is not there for an \u201cimage makeover project.\u201d While change may be happening, it\u2019s not happening fast enough for critics. I caught up with Ward in an interview at the company\u2019s booth at the Gamescom expo in Cologne, Germany. Here\u2019s an edited transcript of our interview. Brian Ward: Sorry I wasn\u2019t able to meet before. GamesBeat: You guys were busy buying somebody. Brian Ward: That was a hectic time. GamesBeat: How are things going since then? Especially with acquiring Scopely. Ward: Very good. We\u2019re obviously delighted to have closed the transaction with Scopely. Their Monopoly Go product is fantastic. It\u2019s doing very well. The people are working super hard on integration. They\u2019ve been a pleasure to work with in that regard. So far we\u2019re delighted. GamesBeat: On things like esports, I wonder how much focus you have on MENA (Middle East/North Africa) versus the wider world. Ward: We\u2019re pretty globally focused. The live attendance on all the majors this year has been up. The viewership, the hours watched have been up. There have been some hiccups in the sector generally with publisher spend on esports this year, but overall the business has been doing great. We\u2019re focused on MENA, of course. The EFG folks are in the middle of executing on Gamers8. There are plans for that tournament to be bigger and more robust next year. There\u2019s a lot going on. The conference next week will be a good one. GamesBeat: Is that a first for them, or have they been doing them before? Ward: This is the second version of Next World Forum. Gamers8 started during COVID as Gamers Without Borders, for charity relief. This is the second version of both the G8 and the NWF. GamesBeat: Is there a feeling of progress as you come out of COVID? Esports had to take some huge hits during that time. It transformed a lot as well. Ward: I think we\u2019re beyond COVID. The capital markets, the economic situation last year and coming into this year, caused some publishers to pull back on their esports spend, which affected a couple of pieces of the business, but overall attendance is up. Viewership is up. There seems to be as much engagement as there was before from a fan point of view. GamesBeat: For Saudi gamers and Saudi esports fans, how would you describe the market? Ward: When we invested in EFG, it seemed that coming out of COVID \u2013 that was nearly two years ago now \u2013 it was an inflection point where engagement had changed or accelerated because of COVID, and there would be some consolidation in esports. There would be some dynamics that would sort themselves out, whether it\u2019s the relationship between players and teams and publishers and where the power base really sits. A lot of that still has to get sorted out. Team economics are not universally great. GamesBeat: The game industry itself, where do you see the trends developing? Ward: We\u2019re super excited, especially on the heels of closing Scopely. We\u2019re excited about mobile-first cross-platform opportunities. Scopely is also making great progress in direct payments. That\u2019s an interesting economic lever for us. For Savvy, we now have a great anchor in mobile. We\u2019re looking forward to figuring out how we can facilitate, like we\u2019re doing with Scopely, some partners in PC and console. GamesBeat: You\u2019re still looking around for opportunities? Ward: This year we haven\u2019t been looking at as many opportunities. We\u2019ve been focused internally on making sure we have the right leadership team in place. Scopely is a big acquisition. The integration is fairly involved. We\u2019re focused on making sure that we\u2019re putting some investment professionals in place, so we don\u2019t rely on external advisors as much. We\u2019re focused internally on our structure and governance and operating model, more so than looking for additional investments. GamesBeat: Were there some things that made you think that the period in which you were buying assets there \u2013 was that fortuitous in some ways? When there are downturns in the economy, prices for acquisitions are lower. It\u2019s a good time to buy. Did that matter to you? If you have strategic imperatives to move into a business fast, you probably don\u2019t care as much about the economic situation. Ward: That\u2019s true. It\u2019s very difficult to time the market. It\u2019s been fortuitous that valuations have come off a bit and those people with capital to employ have been in a market where it\u2019s been more difficult for people to find as many varied sources of capital as there were two years ago. That\u2019s advantageous to us. But we haven\u2019t pulled on that lever very hard. This year we\u2019ve been focused more internally. GamesBeat: For games it seems like there was a lot of pressure on valuations, after some very big excitement in 2021. Everybody thought that usage was going to go up forever. Is there a level-setting that you see that still reflects favorable trends? Ward: Overall, I think the trends are super favorable for the long term. We don\u2019t get too excited about this year versus last year or 2022 versus COVID. Long term we think this is probably the best entertainment business to be in. Yes, there\u2019s some sort of reconciliation. Figuring out where usage and engagement will land after COVID. But that will settle. GamesBeat: I listened to Take-Two\u2019s earnings call. It was interesting to hear Strauss Zelnick answer a question about games and Hollywood, all the synergy happening right now. Someone asked why they aren\u2019t doing more of that. He said, \u201cWe came from movies. It was a very hard business. There were many failures.\u201d For years everyone saw that the big opportunity was in games, so why would they go back in a big way? Although he did say that they\u2019re working on a Borderlands movie and some other projects. They\u2019re participating in that. But he felt like it was a no-brainer that gaming is still the more interesting business. Ward: It\u2019s kind of the flip side of the trend from 20 years ago, where movies became games. Now it\u2019s games becoming movies. GamesBeat: Do you think about that as an opportunity as well? Ward: Not yet. We\u2019re not focused on that at the moment. I still view us as a startup. We have maybe a couple hundred people in Saudi Arabia and 4,000 worldwide. We still have a lot of things to do in terms of building a games business. We have a pretty good esports business. GamesBeat: Are you focused on building a larger local staff? Ward: Very much so. The studio, which is now renamed Steer Studios, has done a super job. They now have about 80 people on two or three mobile teams, and 80% of them are Saudis. We\u2019re highly focused and highly incentivized against building out the local ecosystem. GamesBeat: How does that mix in with the Scopely business? Is it alongside Scopely? Ward: Scopely is very interested in the MENA region and expanding beyond their traditional markets. We expect that they\u2019ll be looking at opportunities in MENA and Saudi specifically. GamesBeat: How do you look back after some years on the issues around human rights that people have had with Saudi Arabia, whether or not they want to do business there? How is that turning out? Ward: My standard answer to this, or part of my standard answer, is for folks to take the time to understand what\u2019s going on there and how far this social transformation and economic diversification project is coming in the last five years. A tremendous amount of progress has been made toward Vision 2030 and all of this transformation. It\u2019s exciting. We\u2019re super happy to be part of it, part of this long-term journey. GamesBeat: Is there some sense of mission attached to that connected to Savvy? Ward: This is what really attracted me to this position and got me to move to Riyadh. I understood a bit about Vision 2030 and the economic diversification, social transformation aspect. But once I saw, once I visited for the first time and saw what that meant on the ground, I could see that this is kind of like China 35 years ago. The pace of change is astonishing. It seemed to be a unique opportunity to take part in something worthwhile. That\u2019s why I went there, and I think a lot of the people we\u2019ve hired and who have moved there are inspired by the same opportunity. GamesBeat: The flow of money into games, do you have any general observations about that? Is there some history to that flow? I just remember that when I joined VentureBeat 15 years ago, I thought I would stop covering games. There was a focus on venture capital for (tech), and there was (virtually) no venture capital for games. I thought I\u2019d end up covering tech more than games. But here we are 15 years later and GamesBeat is very big. Ward: You would know far more about this, but the level of engagement and the fan base and reach now of games, for those of us who\u2019ve been doing this almost 30 years \u2013 I remember thinking, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if we were eventually bigger than the music industry?\u201d Now we\u2019re bigger than those guys and the movies and somebody else put together. When you think about 3.2 billion people on the planet playing games on a regular basis, it\u2019s astonishing. GamesBeat: Saudi Arabia is also into building new cities and new structures. Do you have some sort of dream for that? How would building cities with games in mind happen? Ward: As you know, Vision 2030 encompasses all of those things. The giga-projects at NEOM and Qiddiya, which have significant \u2013 I mean, Qiddiya is essentially an entertainment-based city being built just west of Riyadh. We have a big part to play in the game section of that city. NEOM has a big games component to it as well. All these things are tied together under not only Vision 2030, but the national strategy for games and esports. Saudi, to my knowledge, is the only country on the planet that\u2019s announced a national strategy backed by the government for our sector. All of these things are interconnected in some pretty major ways. GamesBeat: The one hiccup that we\u2019ve seen lately is whether or not you were going to do the investment in Embracer. I don\u2019t know how you would signal to the rest of the market what that means. That particular deal is one that maybe wasn\u2019t going to happen. Is there any change in strategy? Ward: We don\u2019t have a change in our strategy. Our strategy has been consistent for the last two years. When we made our initial significant investment in Embracer, we had great faith in the leadership and the long-term strategic vision for Embracer. That hasn\u2019t changed either. We\u2019re very happy with our investment in Embracer over the long term. GamesBeat: The interest in doing large deals, is that still part of what you want? Ward: I think Scopely is the sixth-largest M&A deal in our industry\u2019s history. We\u2019re still interested, and we\u2019ve deployed maybe 25% of the capital designed to be allocated to us over the long term. We still have a significant part of our mandate to fulfill. GamesBeat: Do you have an interest in making sure you\u2019re not perceived as investing at valuations that are too high, or throwing too much money at your targets? Ward: We employ a lot of excellent and well-paid advisors to give us good opinions on these things. We trust the advice they give us. We think we\u2019ve done deals that have been very beneficial to Saudi and fair to both parties. If we looked at the transaction value on Scopely today we\u2019d be very pleased with how that\u2019s working out, given our mission. It\u2019s long term. People probably thought Amazon paying a billion dollars for Twitch was crazy at the time. GamesBeat: The good old days, when prices were low. For women in Saudi Arabia, do you feel like there are real opportunities for change for them? Ward: This is the thing that surprised me. I didn\u2019t have any personal knowledge or experience of the region. To see firsthand what was going on there in relation to opportunities for women, just generally speaking, was a real eye-opener. In a studio, which has nearly 80 people so far \u2013 this is a development studio. Almost 30% of that workforce are women. At any studio anywhere in the world that would be a pretty remarkable number. There\u2019s an equally high percentage of women in the Saudi workforce generally. It\u2019s exciting. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019m really happy about. When the Scopely guys came to visit, around the time of the closing, or just prior to the closing, we had a lunch for Scopely leadership and all of the local women employees in Saudi. The Scopely folks said they were blown away by the level of energy, enthusiasm, knowledge, and professionalism in that group. One of them said he wished he could bottle up that energy and take it back to California. GamesBeat: U.S. money has been going all over the world for decades. I suppose you could put an interpretation on that money. When China was also in the position of being able to finance a lot of the world, I think people wondered if they have a philosophy that also gets exported along with those investments in all those companies. Do they run these companies in a Chinese way? What is your own view as far as the next entity that really has the opportunity to invest all over the world? Is there a philosophy you\u2019d like to export, but also maybe one that stays at home in Saudi Arabia as well? Ward: There isn\u2019t a philosophy, other than we\u2019ve always intended to be and have been consistent in communicating this \u2013 we\u2019ve been given carte blanche to operate like a true games company, consistent with the values of our industry, what people consider to be important. That\u2019s been true. That was one thing I was pretty alive to when I first thought about the opportunity, because to your point, Chinese companies tend to operate \u2013 not all of them, but they tend to operate in a Chinese way. Western companies operate in a western way. But I can\u2019t say there\u2019s any defining set of values around being a Saudi games company. We\u2019re just trying to be a games company, period. GamesBeat: One interesting data point, maybe, that I was thinking about now. I wrote a profile on this guy named Amir Satvat who works for Amazon. He\u2019s kind of a quant. During the big layoffs that started happening in the fall, he started scraping all the game industry sites for job openings. He aggregated them into a spreadsheet on LinkedIn and made it available for everyone to look at. Here\u2019s all the jobs. He came up with 732 companies and 14,000 jobs that are open. The fun part was that he\u2019s noticed that for the last six weeks or so, that number has been steady. He sees that as a stabilization happening over a relatively short amount of time. Before that openings were tending to go down. Does that mean anything to you, that the collective number of jobs in the game industry is starting to go back up? Ward: I\u2019m not an expert by any stretch. I would anticipate that most of the post-COVID reconciliation of how many users there are, the engagement level and so forth has sorted itself out in terms of how many people we need to meet demand. We should start to be back to business as usual. That\u2019s what I would expect. GamesBeat: There\u2019s AI as well. Nobody knows what that\u2019s going to mean. I talked to a professor a few weeks ago who was saying that we could have a 10% boost to world GDP by 2032 with all the AI advances happening now. That\u2019s $11 trillion. That\u2019s happening. He thinks there\u2019s going to be more change in the next 10 years from AI than in the last 150 years of industrial revolution. One of his guys looked at a typical 2,000-person enterprise and found that jobs in that enterprise would probably be done with one-third to two-thirds fewer people. All these things seem to suggest we\u2019re about to be in another time of change. We thought there was change already in the last few decades, but there\u2019s more coming. Ward: But isn\u2019t that one of the best things about our industry, the constant change and development and evolution of it? I think AI is going to add a lot of jobs. There will be shifting in who does what. Did we need less artists when SpeedTree was introduced? No, we needed more. More tools mean more stuff gets done. That\u2019s the way I view it.

Since leading American companies rely on these chips, any sustained disruption in their supply would be disastrous to our economy. In recent decades, financial markets have encouraged such geographical specialization. They have rewarded U.S. companies for outsourcing and offshoring even high-tech manufacturing to countries with lower costs, greater scale, or greater production expertise \u2014 and more generous underpinning all these advantages. Now, with rising geopolitical tensions beginning to fragment global supply chains, it has become clear that the U.S. should have at least some state-of-the-art manufacturing presence in technologies critical to our economy. Fortunately, Congress last year enacted laws designed to revive the domestic production of , as well as and \u2014two other pivotal technologies, whose and are now dominated by China. But these are attempts to recapture manufacturing industries already largely lost. We should not repeat this history with the critical technologies currently emerging from American research laboratories, including quantum technologies, biomanufacturing, and down the road, fusion energy. Because of the groundbreaking research and development conducted by our universities, businesses, and national laboratories, the U.S. consistently generates great ideas for new technologies. But too often the ideas that originate in the U.S. end up being manufactured in other countries. Private investors in the U.S. generally seek out opportunities to earn high returns quickly. The of a is rarely such an opportunity. Prototyping can be expensive and challenging. A production process has to be invented and refined over time. Building or retooling factories can cost , or tens of billions. Massive production scales are needed to cover costs and produce returns. Risks abound. As a result, the U.S. has experienced decades of in manufacturing, leaving us without the ecosystem of talent, expertise, facilities, and suppliers required to steadily bring state-of-the-art products to market. Since advances in often inspire product advances, we have lost a source of . This is not just an economic problem, but also a national security problem: Since the defense market alone is too small to provide the scale required to support state-of-the-art manufacturing in the , our military also depends on commercial manufacturing. It is time to recognize that the U.S. cannot rely solely on private investment to create the kind of manufacturing base that will protect us from geopolitical upheaval. The federal government needs to actively support the domestic manufacturing of critical emerging technologies, rather than merely react after the fact to particular supply chain crises. If instead the U.S. continues playing a catch-up game, we are bound to fall behind China, which intends to dominate global markets in of strategic importance. Given our remarkable culture of innovation in the U.S., we don\u2019t need to mimic China to compete with China. We merely need a keener sense of where and when it is in the national interest for our government to address the systematic underinvestment of private capital in American manufacturing. Our focus should be on incentivizing private investments in the domestic manufacturing of emerging technologies with significant national and economic security implications. If we created a new U.S. government corporation for this purpose \u2014 underwritten by the government but operating independently in selecting the most promising projects for funding \u2014 we could help to de-risk private investment by providing some of the initial patient capital required to prototype a product, build or retool a factory, and scale up. Tax policies could be redesigned to promote such investment. Government procurement contracts could create a market for the new technology. Once a manufacturing company is up, running, and competing, we should leave it to fend for itself. As a country, we are breathtakingly creative in devising new technologies, designs, and services. Now we need to be equally creative on the policy front to ensure that the most important of these technologies \u2014 even those with the most challenging of manufacturing processes \u2014 can be made and scaled here at home. This is the best way to guarantee a reliable supply of critical emerging products, while also helping the U.S. to lead the world in innovation. .", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 12:00:00", "image_url": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/microchip_104_istock.jpg?w=900", "source_id": "thehill", "source_priority": 393, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["technology"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "dfae1718108c1b4f68a2cc9acfbdf0c7", "title": "The 3 Best Growth Stocks to Buy Now: September 2023", "link": "https://investorplace.com/2023/09/the-3-best-growth-stocks-to-buy-now-september-2023/", "keywords": ["Stocks to Buy", "NYSE:ANET", "NASDAQ:NVDA", "NASDAQ:CELH", "Stocks to Buy"], "creator": ["Marc Guberti"], "video_url": null, "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips These growth stocks can generate solid gains for long-term investors.

The Rich Use This Income Secret (NOT Dividends) Far More Than Regular Investors", "content": "Growth stocks tend to be riskier than blue-chip stocks , but investors can reap some of the highest returns with these assets. While growth stocks often get hit hard by market corrections, these are the types of stocks that can double or triple within a few years. Cathie Woods\u2019 growth-centric funds demonstrate how quickly growth stocks can soar and how quickly they can crash. Her funds were among the top performers during the pandemic, but those funds came crashing down in 2022. Those same funds have experienced a resurgence this year due to growth stocks becoming favorable again. You don\u2019t have to invest in high-revenue, high-losses companies to get the growth investor experience. There are plenty of growth stocks with good fundamentals and promising prospects. These are three of the best growth stocks to consider buying. Arista Networks (ANET) Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET ) is a cloud networking company that has more than 8,000 customers and a 19% market share in data centers. Shares trade at a reasonable 36 P/E ratio and have gained over 60% year-to-date. The cloud networking company has rewarded long-term investors with a 192% gain throughout the past five years. Arista Networks got its start by working with financial companies that wanted to enable high-frequency trading for their customers. This start helped the company expand into data centers and early-stage companies. The firm has worked with many large customers, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), VMware (NYSE: VMW ) and Dell (NYSE: DELL ). The company has dozens of products, including Cloud Vision and AI Spine. Cloud Vision helps with workflow automation, while AI Spine enables top-tier AI interconnection which is essential for real-time gaming, virtual reality and metaverse applications. Arista Networks also has a cybersecurity component through its Zero Trust Networking service and recently introduced Cognitive Unified Edge, a product for small businesses. Arista Networks reported 38.7% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter . GAAP net income jumped from $299.1 million in Q2 2022 to $491.9 million in the most recent second quarter. That marks a 64.5% year-over-year gain which makes the stock\u2019s P/E ratio look more justified. Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has been at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom. Shares have more than tripled year-to-date and are up by over 600% throughout the past five years. I have expressed skepticism about Nvidia\u2019s valuation in the past, but the most recent earnings report has made the valuation easier to justify. The stock\u2019s P/E ratio is roughly 120 which is still high, but a few weeks ago, the stock had a 250 P/E ratio. Nvidia doubled its Q2 revenue year-over-year and experienced 843% year-over-year net income growth. That latter metric explains why the stock can become more affordable in the future. Shares only trade at a 47 forward P/E ratio which is justifiable given the company\u2019s incredible growth rate. No investor should expect Nvidia to hold onto these growth rates forever. The company reported $13.5 billion in revenue and $6.2 billion in net income. It\u2019s impossible for net income to grow another 843% year-over-year because net income would have to surpass revenue. Eventually, the growth will slow down because it is unsustainable. Investors should consider how long Nvidia can hold onto these growth rates. If Nvidia continues on this trajectory for another year before retaining moderate growth rates (i.e., respectable double-digit revenue growth), the valuation can be a bargain for investors who buy at the current price. Celsius Holdings (CELH) Most growth stocks are tech companies that tap into innovative concepts. However, some companies buck the trend and give shareholders enticing opportunities. Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH ) investors know first-hand that the best growth stocks aren\u2019t always in the tech sector. The stock has almost doubled year-to-date but is up by an astounding 4,295% throughout the past five years. The energy drink producer reported a 112% year-over-year revenue jump in the second quarter. The company also reported $41 million in net income attributable to common shareholders which represents a 345% year-over-year gain. Celsius Holdings doesn\u2019t have the most attractive valuation, but growth rates and new partnerships make the stock look compelling over the long run. A recent partnership with Pepsi (NYSE: PEP ) can give Celsius Holdings more exposure to international markets. Celsius Holdings has a $15 billion market cap. As the company continues to grow its market share on the back of stupendous revenue and earnings growth, that market cap can become much larger.

We already know about the and the but everyone is eager to hear more about an actually affordable EV from Tesla that would sell for around $25,000. Now we have a better idea, thanks to an report and Elon Musk\u2019s biographer, Walter Isaacson. The report reveals a lot about the messy inner workings of Tesla but also confirms that Tesla making a $25,000 EV that features a like the Cybertruck. Along with the affordable EV, we\u2019ll also see a fully autonomous EV that will be built on the same platform as the $25,000 option. Here are the five major takeaways we learned from what Isaacson divulged to . Tesla previously revealed a conceptual drawing of what a compact EV could look like. TESLA IS MAKING BOTH A $25,000 EV AND A ROBOTAXI Tesla devotees have been waiting for the holy grail of affordable EVs from the company and the report confirms that a $25,000 EV is indeed in the works. The at its starting price of more than $40,000 (before any tax credits), but a Tesla priced around $25,000 would be a lot more accessible. The $25,000 EV was almost scrapped by Musk, according to the report. Isaacson says Musk was so dead set on delivering a robotaxi that he almost ditched plans to make the affordable EV, to instead focus on delivering a fully autonomous electric vehicle. In the end, Tesla execs were able to convince Musk to make this \u201csmall, inexpensive global car\u201d to meet Tesla\u2019s annual growth target. When this $25,000 will be announced and launch is anyone\u2019s guess, though. The very first Cybertruck just rolled off the production line and the Roadster is not expected to start production until the end of 2024. BOTH EVS WILL USE A \u201cNEXT-GEN\u201d PLATFORM To get Musk to agree to build the robotaxi the $25,000 EV, Tesla execs convinced him they could build both EVs using a \u201cnext-generation\u201d engineering platform, according to the report. The plan worked as Musk saw this as an opportunity to build a \u201chigh-speed, ultra-automated\u201d manufacturing process for both EVs. Tesla is already building out its Cybertruck in its headquarters, so there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll see the facility expand to design and manufacture Tesla\u2019s upcoming EVs. This makes even more sense considering both of them will share a similar design. BOTH OF THEM WILL LOOK LIKE THE CYBERTRUCK For those who are still a fan of the Cybertruck look, the good thing is that both of Tesla\u2019s upcoming affordable and autonomous EVs will sport a similar, futuristic look. According to , Tesla\u2019s chief designer, Franz Von Holzhausen, showed models of each EV to Musk in February 2023. Both models will have a similar design to the Cybertruck, with harsh angles, clad in stainless steel, and an almost alien-like look. Upon seeing the concepts, Musk loved them and said that \u201cpeople will think they are seeing something from the future,\u201d according to the report. THE ROBOTAXI WON\u2019T HAVE ANY CONTROLS Just for the robotaxi model, the design would remove steering wheels, mirrors, and pedals to fully embrace an autonomous look. In theory, this design would solely rely on Tesla\u2019s Full-Self Driving tech. Musk did acknowledge the risk in designing it as a \u201cclean robotaxi,\u201d but wanted to go \u201call in on autonomy.\u201d Tesla gave us a look at what a Model 3 looks like without a steering wheel back in 2019. Unfortunately, we\u2019re not sure the public is ready for that. Full-Self Driving has had a spotty history despite being a relatively new technology. There are ways around its safety checks, like using a , and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened looking at fatal accidents where Tesla models were involved. Hopefully, Tesla will have worked out all the kinks by the time its robotaxi releases. YOU COULD MAKE MONEY OFF THE ROBOTAXI It is being referred to as a robotaxi, after all. In the report, Musk says that Tesla owners would earn more than $30,000 by sending out their robotaxis to run errands or offer driverless rides to others. Tesla robotaxi owners would even be able to rent out their EVs on Tesla\u2019s car-sharing network, as back in 2019.

You can soon buy shares of Instacart stock on the Nasdaq following Instacart's IPO in September 2023. To buy Instacart stock, set up a brokerage account, research Instacart financials, and come up with an investment strategy. IPO stocks tend to go to institutions and high-net-worth investors first, so retail investors will have to be patient. The end of summer 2023 marks a new beginning for Instacart, as the popular grocery delivery and pick-up service announces that its initial public offering ( IPO ) is scheduled for some point in September 2023. After years of teasing a much-anticipated public offering, the time has finally come, making it one of the most high-profile US listings this year. However, retail investors may still have a hard time buying the stock as IPO shares are often reserved for high-net-worth investors, bankers, hedge funds , and large institutions. Right now, SoFi Invest is the only confirmed brokerage that plans to offer Instacart stock to its users. Here's how you can buy Instacart stock (CART). Learn how to buy shares in some of the largest US tech companies on the market. Here's how to buy Amazon stock and Insider's step-by-step guide on how to buy Apple stock . About the Instacart IPO On August 25, 2023, Instacart officially filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to become a publicly traded company. The business was founded in 2012 and over time has accumulated funding from 37 venture capital firms. The largest investors in Instacart to date have been Sequoia Capital and Capital Partners. The lead underwriters for Instacart's IPO are Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase. As a private company, only venture capitalists and certain high-net-worth individuals have previously been able to get their hands on Instacart shares (aka private equity). The main goal for private equity investors is to \"increase the company's profit from an exit,\" explains Matt Malone, head of investment management at Opto Investments . \"The exit could be an initial public offering (IPO), sale, or other liquidity event. Private equity investors are paid with proceeds from those exits.\" But that's all set to change. Soon retail investors will be able to find Instacart stock on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker \"CART.\" Retail investors are individual investors who use their own funds to buy, sell, and trade assets through brokerages/investment platforms. Not only will Instacart be the most notable US venture-backed tech IPO since December 2021 , but it will also be the first independent grocery delivery business to ever go public. While no one knows for certain how it will all shake out, it has been revealed that Instacart plans to sell $175 million in Series A preferred stock to PepsiCo . SoFi , one of the best robo-advisors , is underwriting Instacart's IPO with plans to offer shares to SoFi users. How to buy Instacart stock 1.

There are several brokerage platforms out there, each with different requirements, limitations, fees, web and mobile access, and resources. Some of the most well-known online brokerages include Charles Schwab , TD Ameritrade , Robinhood , and Interactive Brokers . SoFi Invest is the only brokerage known to hold Instacart shares with the intention of offering stock to its users. Therefore, opening an account with SoFi is not only your best option, but also your only option at this time. Brokerages other than SoFi that will offer Instacart IPO stock are still largely up in the air. You might also get some luck by opening an account with a broker that already offers IPO access. Robinhood, for example, offers IPO access to users through its IPO Access Program. But there's no guarantee that you'll get access to Instacart stock. You may also be able to invest in Instacart through mutual funds , such as Fidelity's Growth Company Fund. Fidelity recently bumped its Instacart Series H shares up 10% at the end of May 2023. 2. Research Instacart financials While investing in a big name like Instacart may sound like a safe investment decision, it's essential that you do your due diligence first and conduct your own research. Although you can't review Instacart's historical stock performance, you can still tune into the company's recent profit history and current market standing. Some key resources to analyze include: Company quarterly earnings reports Income statements Balance sheets After skyrocketing during the COVID-19 pandemic and reaching its peak in Q2 of 2022, Instacart found itself steadily declining as inflation marked up prices on groceries and as people returned to shopping for themselves. Last year, the company cut its valuation multiple times. However, in 2023, Instacart raised its valuation to about $12 billion . Instacart closed 2022 with $428 million in profits. During the first six months of 2023, Instacart reported a profit of $242 million. That's a significant increase compared to what the company earned during the same period the previous year . Despite its recent success, higher grocery prices and economic concerns could hurt Instacart's success in the long run. 3. Determine how much to invest and place an order In general, how much you want to invest depends on your individual investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. It also depends on the price of the shares and how much you're looking to spend. There are four main types of orders you can make when requesting the share price you want: Market order : Orders are immediately executed so that the per-share price currently reflects the stock's current share value. But you can't set the share price before executions, which doesn't make it ideal for investors hoping to bear the stock's current market value. Limit order : You can set a price threshold for shares for buying and selling stock. This is best for investors who want control over how much they are spending on shares. For example, if Instacart stock is trading at $200, and you set your limit order for $150, the brokerage won't complete your order unless the stock's value drops to your limit order price. Stop order : Also called stop-loss order, this order type allows you to set a stop price. That means that if your stock reaches the stop price, it will become a market order and be executed immediately. Stop-limit order : Similar to a stop order, this type of order allows you to establish a set price to stop for your stock's value. But instead of becoming a market order, your order becomes a limit order when your stocks reach the established stock price. But just because you request a certain number of shares doesn't guarantee that you'll get it. As mentioned above, IPO shares tend to be reserved for high-net-worth individuals and intuitions, so retail investors may struggle to get in on the action. Plus, brokers only have a set number of shares available, so you'll have to be patient. 4. Review your purchase and monitor your investment Getting the shares is only the first step in turning a profit. You'll need to implement an investing strategy, such as a buy-and-hold strategy or dollar-cost averaging. This way, you won't be glued to the market hour by hour watching Instacart's stock chart. Here are some common investing strategies: Buy-and-hold : This investment strategy is most appealing to passive and long-term investors. After purchasing a lump sum's worth of Instacart stock, you can sit back and wait for your shares to increase in value over time. You won't cash out until you feel the time is right. Dollar-cost averaging : If you want to regularly contribute to Instacart, this strategy may be a good fit. Instead of purchasing a large sum at once, you can determine how much you're wanting to periodically invest (e.g., $10, $50, $100). As with an investment, no investment is immune to the fluctuations of the stock market. In the event of a struggling economy or a bear market , share prices may drop drastically. Make sure to keep cool and don't make any rash decisions. \"The risk of loss is possibly the greatest risk when investing your money. Diversification can help to mitigate this risk,\" says Gorelick.
