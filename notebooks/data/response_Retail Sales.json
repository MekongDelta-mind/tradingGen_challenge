Here's what parents need to know about the challenge and your kids' safety. Yes, the \"One Chip Challenge\" Is Just as Dangerous as You've Heard We've seen TikTok challenges gone wrong before \u2014 you remember when social media users were boiling raw chicken in NyQuil, right? However, maybe none have been quite as controversial as the \"One Chip Challenge,\" which recently killed 14-year-old Harris Wolobah. While the product itself, a single chip made with Carolina Reaper and Naga Viper peppers, was quickly pulled from shelves following the reported death, Paqui has been selling the fire-hot tortilla chip packaged in a coffin-shaped container since 2016. And the product has still been spotted for sale on certain online retailers. This isn't the first time that the Paqui product has been linked to serious health concerns. According to Raj Dasgupta, MD, pulmonary specialist and chief medical advisor for Sleep Advisor, there has been a history of mouth and throat pain, nausea and vomiting, seizures, and now death. \"While the Paqui One Chip Challenge is intended for adults only, we have seen an increase in teen usage of the product. We care about all of our consumers and have made the decision to remove the product from shelves,\" a spokesperson for the brand said in a statement per NBC, adding that the company is \"deeply saddened by the death\" of Wolobah. \"We are actively working with our retailers and are offering refunds for any purchases of our single-serve one chip challenge product.\" Here's everything you\u2026 Megan Schaltegger", "pubDate": "2023-09-10 02:40:04", "image_url": "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/ueHgr0Kw0vFbEm5tqlJE9frFTE0/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2023/09/08/927/n/24155406/tmp_Lj5afH_5f5b76591425bd46_GettyImages-1431486081.jpg", "source_id": "knowledia", "source_priority": 167779, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "46966fb5a73c085f3ca07045240a9255", "title": "Grouse opener brings out hunters who hike for their birds (and words to live by from Bud Grant)", "link": "https://www.startribune.com/grouse-opener-minnesota-bud-grant-upland-hunters-dennis-anderson/600302978/", "keywords": null, "creator": ["Dennis Anderson"], "video_url": null, "description": "Upland hunters prefer to walk for their birds, often endlessly, rather than sit in a duck blind and await their prey to arrive. Boot leather, briar-proof pants and Bud Grant were made for the challenge.", "content": "Years ago when I lived in Ely and grouse season rolled around, as it will again Saturday the 16th, I regularly strolled into the woods toting a Model 12 Winchester. I had cut down this vintage smoke pole from its original 30 inches to a more swingworthy 28 and bored it for Briley chokes, screwing in the cylinder option for Ol' Ruff. The Winchester wasn't much of a grouse gun but it was the only gun I owned. Cased, it could slide behind the seat of my '56 Willys pickup, while my yellow Labrador, Boogie, rode sidekick. Dinner was what we brought home, if anything. Duck hunting is a good time, but the uplands and the many game birds they harbor \u2014 woodcock, pheasants, various species of quail, prairie chickens, sharp-tailed grouse and Hungarian partridge, in addition to my Ely quarry, ruffed grouse \u2014 often attract wing shooting specialists who want nothing to do with targeting mallards or other fowl. Exercise freaks by another name, upland hunters prefer to walk for their birds, often endlessly, rather than sit in a blind and await their prey to arrive over decoys. Already this early fall, sharptail seasons are open in North Dakota and Montana, and Minnesota nimrods eager to wear out boot leather are striding across western prairies, having the time of their lives putting birds in their hands. Or trying to. Among these is Jerry Kolter, who with his wife, Betsy, owns a Sandstone, Minn, setter and pointer training and breeding kennel. As you read this, Jerry's following an eager phalanx of his charges over hardscrabble flatlands, awaiting one of them to point and his other dogs to back \u2014 a visual rush that for centuries has inspired scattergunners and painters alike. Bud Grant was more of a duck hunter than an uplander, but he could cover country like Big Foot if there was a chance a covey of sharptails lay ahead. Years ago, Bud and I were in North Dakota, hightailing it through Bismarck, where at Bud's insistence we pulled over for ice cream. \"It's bad luck to drive by a Dairy Queen without stopping,'' Bud said. \"Words to live by,'' I said. Bud was running a black Lab named Maggie at the time and she could go all day working the willowy draws that pockmark the country on either side of the Missouri, near the North Dakota-South Dakota border. For my part, I put to ground a setter named Risky, and she and Maggie worked well together, one nearer, one farther out, angling into the wind or cutting it obliquely, eager to get a nose full of sharptail. This was later in autumn, after pheasant season had opened, and we were chasing these florid birds, too \u2014 ditch parrots as some roustabouts call them. By then in southwest North Dakota, the wheat stubble was colored goldenrod and the cottonwoods were shedding leaves. Each day, morning til sundown, we strode into this autumnal milieu, not killing many birds, but their scarcity hardly dampened our enthusiasm. In fact, the fewer the birds, the farther and faster we hiked, adopting like religion the uplander's credo, however fanciful, that just over the next rise, payoff awaits for sure , one sharptail after another, flying low and cackling. Though not the blaze-orange holiday it once was, in the years after I finished school in Morris, the day the pheasant season opened, and the day before and the day after, was in aggregate that university's real homecoming, no football required. A motel in that town, the Sunwood \u2014 now under a different name \u2014 was ringneck central over those long weekends in the '80s and into the '90s, and every manner of dog arrived there in every manner of pickup, their drivers guiding the rigs exuberantly. Like birds of a feather, uplanders share an affinity for a certain look afield, beginning with well-oiled boots and including briar-proof pants, a warm-but-not-too-warm blaze orange shirt or jacket, and ending with a similarly colored ball cap and vest whose rear pocket is big enough to carry felled birds. In Morris in those days, a few hundred of these similarly clad shotgunners would fan out posthaste from the Sunwood shortly after dawn on opening morning. Viewed from above, say as a red-tailed hawk could while catching the day's early thermals, this outpouring might recall a prison break, or perhaps a running start at Le Mans. Such eagerness, whose seasonal stirrings begin just now, in September, is nearly as old as time itself. As far back as the 1500s, Henry VIII waylaid grouse, woodcock and snipe in Britain with a crude form of shotgun that, while kicking like a mule, nevertheless toppled birds. Daniel Myron Lefever, an American, accelerated both upland sport and meal provisioning when in 1878 he invented the first hammerless shotgun, and by 1908, the Sears & Roebuck catalog featured an impressive 23 pages of shotguns for sale, including the New England Hammerless, retailing for $11.95 and manufactured in the Sears & Roebuck factory. So it is now, on the eve of the 2023 Minnesota ruffed (and sharp-tailed) grouse opener, and following it the woodcock and pheasant openers, that uplanders statewide are ripe for new beginnings. Some of these sporting types will chase birds in Minnesota only, hoping in coming months with the aid of their springer spaniels, wirehaired pointing Griffons, Pudelpointers, Gordon setters and other canines to still the echos of their yawning freezers \u2014 the better to pass the coming winter. Still other uplanders will consider the fall seasons here only a start, and in coming months will travel south to Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas, and then farther south still, to Texas and Arizona and even to Mexico, extending their days afield into next year, and hanging up their guns only then. Boot leather was made for this, also briar-proof pants and blaze orange shirts, jackets, caps and vests. And, I guess, Dairy Queens.", "pubDate": "2023-09-10 01:04:47", "image_url": null, "source_id": "startribune", "source_priority": 3221, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "856a3c5a797087228dc73ac936c707bb", "title": "Newsquawk Week Ahead 11th-15th September", "link": "https://www.forexlive.com/centralbank/newsquawk-week-ahead-11th-15th-september-20230909/", "keywords": ["Central Banks"], "creator": ["Newsquawk Analysis", "www.forexlive.com"], "video_url": null, "description": "Week Ahead 11th-15th SeptemberMON: Norwegian CPI (Aug)TUE: EIA STEO, OPEC MOMR; Swedish Unemployment (Aug), UK Unemployment (Aug) & Wages (Jul), NorwegianGDP (Jul), Germany/EZ ZEW (Sep)WED: IEA OMR; UK GDP Estimate (Jul), US CPI (Aug)THU: ECB Policy Announcement, Norges Bank Regional Network; Australian Employment (Aug), Swedish CPIF (Aug),US Retail Sales (Aug), IJC (w/e 4th Sep), New Zealand Manufacturing PMI (Aug)FRI: Quad Witching, CBR Policy Announcement, ECB TLTRO Repayment Publication; Chinese Industrial Output/Production, Retail Sales, House Prices (Aug), EZ Trade Balance (Jul), US Export/Import Prices (Aug), IndustrialProduction (Aug), NY Fed Manufacturing (Sep), Uni. of Michigan Prelim. (Sep)NOTE: Previews are listed in day orderNORWEGIAN CPI (MON): The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced.UK UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES (TUE): Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end.UK GDP ESTIMATE (WED): A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought.US CPI (WED): Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern.ECB ANNOUNCEMENT (THU): 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%.AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYMENT (THU): participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms.SWEDISH CPIF (THU): July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak.US RETAIL SALES (THU): Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July. While the data set will offer a glimpse on the health of the consumer amid concerns that the economy may slow significantly in the months ahead, traders will also be watching the University of Michigan's prelim survey release due Friday, where the rise in energy prices is likely to have weighed on sentiment.CHINESE ACTIVITY DATA (FRI): Retail sales Y/Y in August are expected to rise by 2.8% (prev. 2.5%), whilst there is currently no consensus for Industrial Production metrics. The data will be closely watched to diagnose the health of the world\u2019s second-larger economy and to gauge the drip-feed of stimulus seen over recent weeks. Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d.This article originally appeared on Newsquawk This article was written by Newsquawk Analysis at www.forexlive.com.", "content": ": The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August.

The obvious solution is to create a regulated market for marijuana, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws' Paul Armentano writes in a guest column.", "content": "Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears alleges there is an influx of fentanyl-laced marijuana coming to Virginia and that the state\u2019s liberal cannabis policies are to blame. She\u2019s wrong on both counts. In a recent appearance on John Reid\u2019s Richmond Morning News podcast, , \u201cNow we have fentanyl coming through our borders and now that we in Virginia have legalized marijuana, you\u2019re getting fentanyl-laced marijuana. And, my God, it is killing us.\u201d In fact, there exist of fentanyl-laced cannabis in Virginia \u2014 or, for that matter, anywhere in the nation. In almost every instance where such cases have been alleged, these claims were after lab tests either the presence of the synthetic opioid or determined that the initial finding was the result of . Even representatives from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have acknowledged that there exists little support for the claim. In fact, a senior chemist for the agency that the DEA has never seized cannabis containing fentanyl. Furthermore, that fentanyl\u2019s active components quickly break down when heated, once it reaches the point of combustion. Consequently, it would be \u201cillogical and scientifically preposterous\u201d to purposefully mix fentanyl with cannabis, says toxicologist Ryan Marino, assistant professor of emergency medicine at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. \u201cThanks to the laws of chemistry, we know better.\u201d That said, the lieutenant governor is correct that cannabis products sold on the unregulated market can sometimes be of variable quality and purity. This is particularly true of so-called \u201chemp-derived\u201d cannabis products sold over the counter in Virginia. analyzing the contents of unregulated delta-8 vapor cartridges identified the presence of heavy metals, including magnesium, chromium, nickel and mercury, along with adulterants and other impurities. However, the solution to these public health concerns is not to call for a return to cannabis criminalization or to stoke sensationalist fears. Rather, Virginia lawmakers should take steps to mitigate consumers\u2019 risk of being exposed to potentially tainted products. In a legally regulated marketplace, cannabis products are made available from licensed manufacturers at retail stores. Cannabis is cultivated and products are manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practices. Products are lab tested and labeled accordingly \u2014 ensuring that consumers have access to products of verified purity and potency. The creation of such a regulated market was the intention of Virginia lawmakers and former Gov. Ralph Northam when in 2021 they legalized the possession and use of limited amounts of cannabis by adults. However, in the years since, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and his administration have made it clear that in taking steps to reign in and regulate the state\u2019s estimated . This head-in-the-sand position makes little sense. Nearly half of all states, including Maryland, have enacted legislation regulating the adult-use cannabis market. None of these states have repealed or even rolled back their legalization laws and public support for these policies has . According to the , legalizing marijuana is one of the few policy positions that a majority of Democrats, independents and Republican voters agree upon. That is because these policies are largely working as politicians and voters intended and they are preferable to prohibition. After a century of failed policies and canna-bigotry, Virginians are ready to move in a different direction \u2014 one that legalizes, regulates and educates. It is time for lawmakers to finish what they started and establish a regulatory framework that allows for the legal, licensed commercial production and retail sale of marijuana to adults.

The family of Harris Wolobah held a vigil Friday, a week after his death on Sept. 1, to remember the basketball-loving 10th grader while they await the results of an autopsy to determine what killed him. Wolobah\u2019s family has blamed the One Chip Challege for the teen\u2019s death. The challenge calls for participants to eat an eponymously named chip and then see how long they can go without consuming other food and water. The family has declined interview requests. Police said they were called to the home on Sept. 1 and found Wolobah \u201cunresponsive and not breathing.\u201d He was transported to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The state medical examiner\u2019s office said it will likely take weeks before Wolobah\u2019s cause of death is determined. But the chip\u2019s manufacturer, Paqui, asked retailers to stop selling the product. People have been weighing in about their own experiences with the chip, which costs roughly $10 and comes individually wrapped in foil in a coffin-shaped box that warns, among other things, that it is made for the \u201cvengeful pleasure of intense heat and pain,\u201d is intended for adults and should be kept out of the reach of children. Despite the warning, children have had no problem buying the chips. A 10-year-old Florida girl was suspended this week for bringing one to school, her father, D\u2019Anton Patrick, told West Palm Beach television station WPTV. Six children at Forest Park Elementary School needed medical attention after coming into contact with the chip Wednesday, according to the suspension letter sent the girl\u2019s parents. Patrick said his 12-year-old son bought the chip at a Walgreens on Tuesday, but the boy\u2019s mother made him throw it away. He said his daughter, though, fished it out of the garbage and brought it to school. \u201cThe box says keep out of the hands of children. It says it\u2019s for adult consumption only. Why are y\u2019all selling it to a 12-year-old child?\u201d Patrick said. There have been reports from around the country of teens who have gotten sick after taking part in the challenge, including three students from a California high school who were sent to a hospital. Paramedics were called to a Minnesota school last year when seven students fell ill after taking part in the challenge. Friends of Wolobah said they heard about the chip challenge on social media and his death has convinced them it is more dangerous than they previously believed. \u201cI feel bad that his life ended short because of a social media challenge,\u201d said Marcus Kaba, 15, who remembered playing basketball with Harris. David Adjer, another teenager at the vigil who went to school with Harris, said he heard about Wolobah getting sick from the chip but found it hard to believe he died. \u201cPeople were telling me Harris passed away. I was just angry,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have this chip anymore. If someone dies from this chip, you should take out \u2026 They should take the chip off the shelves because we don\u2019t need any more accidents like this.\u201d Adults, too, have been testing their spice tolerance. Joaquin Diaz, a 31-year-old construction worker from the Bronx, in New York, said he tried the chip a few weeks ago after coming across social media videos about the challenge. He said he loves spicy food and wanted to see how he\u2019d stack up. Diaz told The Associated Press by phone Friday that the chip was very hot, but he didn\u2019t expect the stomach cramps and diarrhea that followed and led to him missing work the next day. \u201cIt hurt, I\u2019m not gonna lie. I was actually a little nervous,\u201d he said. Despite the stomach issues, Diaz said he had planned to try the chip again with some friends. But he decided not to after he heard about Wolobah\u2019s death. Roger Trier, a 56-year-old content creator and graphic designer from Palatine, Illinois, posted video on TikTok and YouTube of himself completing a 100-chip challenge this month. He told the AP that he has trained for over 20 years to build up his spice tolerance. \u201cMost people you see on social media \u2014 with any challenges \u2014 don\u2019t understand the consequences,\u201d he said. Trier said he thinks people under the age of 18 shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do spicy challenges without adult supervision because they might not know how to deal with the intense reactions the food can cause or the peer pressure that can push them to take risks they don\u2019t understand. Although the chip could still be bought in some stores as of Thursday, by Friday it had disappeared from the shelves of major retailers, including 7-Eleven and Walgreens. Amazon halted sales and was notifying customers who bought the product recently that Paqui was removing it. And eBay said it was blocking One Chip Challenge listings. Sales of the chip seem largely driven by people posting videos on social media of them or their friends taking the challenge. They show people, including children, unwrapping the packaging, eating the chips and then reacting to the heat. Some videos show people gagging, coughing and begging for water. Neither Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, Google, which owns YouTube, nor TikTok immediately replied to Friday requests for comment about whether they were taking any action. Paqui, a Texas-based subsidiary of The Hershey Company, said in a statement posted on its website Thursday that it was \u201cdeeply saddened by the death\u201d of Wolobah. \u201cWe have seen an increase in teens and other individuals not heeding these warnings,\u201d the company said. \u201cAs a result, while the product continues to adhere to food safety standards, out of abundance of caution, we are actively working with retailers to remove the product from shelves.\u201d At the vigil Friday, a crowd of about 100, including many of Wolobah\u2019s friends and teammates, turned out to a park in Worcester, down the hill from his home. They lit candles, swapped stories and ate pizza. Huge photos of the dread-locked teen hung from a statue, surrounded by his name in gold letters and blue and white balloons. Tiny basketballs were handed out. The most poignant moment came when Wolobah\u2019s mother, Lois, approached her son\u2019s photo, staring up at it, calling out his name several times and sobbing. She almost collapsed at one point and had to be held up by other family members as a relative addressed the crowd. \u201cI look around and see a community bond together by candlelight, by love and by the memory of our brother, of our son, of our nephew Harris,\u201d his cousin Valerie Richardson said. \u201cHarris had this gift for bringing people together. I can\u2019t think of a better way to honor him than what we are doing right here, right now.\u201d Massachusetts authorities posted a warning to parents about the challenge. And physicians cautioned that eating such spicy foods can have unintended consequences. \u201cYou can have very mild symptoms like burning or tingling of the lips in the mouth, but you can also have more severe symptoms,\u201d like significant abdominal pain or nausea and vomiting said Dr. Lauren Rice, the chief of pediatric emergency medicine at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. Dr. Peter Chai, an associate professor of emergency medicine and medical toxicology at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, said the chips can be dangerous under certain circumstances. \u201cIt\u2019s possible eating these chips with high concentration of capsaicin could cause death,\u201d Chai said, referring to the component of chili peppers that gives them their heat. \u201cIt would really depend on the amount of capsaicin that an individual was exposed to.

(AP) \u2014 The death of a Massachusetts teenager after his family said he ate an extremely spicy tortilla chip has led to an outpouring of concern about the social media challenge and prompted retailers to pull the product from their shelves at the manufacturer's request. The family of Harris Wolobah held a vigil Friday, a week after his death on Sept. 1, to remember the basketball-loving 10th grader while they await the results of an autopsy to determine what killed him. Wolobah\u2019s family has blamed the One Chip Challege for the teen\u2019s death. The challenge calls for participants to eat an eponymously named chip and then see how long they can go without consuming other food and water. The family has declined interview requests. Police said they were called to the home on Sept. 1 and found Wolobah \u201cunresponsive and not breathing.\u201d He was transported to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The state medical examiner's office said it will likely take weeks before Wolobah's cause of death is determined. But the chip's manufacturer, Paqui, asked retailers to stop selling the product. People have been weighing in about their own experiences with the chip, which costs roughly $10 and comes individually wrapped in foil in a coffin-shaped box that warns, among other things, that it is made for the \u201cvengeful pleasure of intense heat and pain,\u201d is intended for adults and should be kept out of the reach of children. Despite the warning, children have had no problem buying the chips. A 10-year-old Florida girl was suspended this week for bringing one to school, her father, D\u2019Anton Patrick, told West Palm Beach television station WPTV. Six children at Forest Park Elementary School needed medical attention after coming into contact with the chip Wednesday, according to the suspension letter sent the girl\u2019s parents. Patrick said his 12-year-old son bought the chip at a Walgreens on Tuesday, but the boy's mother made him throw it away. He said his daughter, though, fished it out of the garbage and brought it to school. \u201cThe box says keep out of the hands of children. It says it\u2019s for adult consumption only. Why are y\u2019all selling it to a 12-year-old child?\u201d Patrick said. There have been reports from around the country of teens who have gotten sick after taking part in the challenge, including three students from a California high school who were sent to a hospital. Paramedics were called to a Minnesota school last year when seven students fell ill after taking part in the challenge. Friends of Wolobah said they heard about the chip challenge on social media and his death has convinced them it is more dangerous than they previously believed. \u201cI feel bad that his life ended short because of a social media challenge,\u201d said Marcus Kaba, 15, who remembered playing basketball with Harris. David Adjer, another teenager at the vigil who went to school with Harris, said he heard about Wolobah getting sick from the chip but found it hard to believe he died. \u201cPeople were telling me Harris passed away. I was just angry,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't think we should have this chip anymore. If someone dies from this chip, you should take out ... They should take the chip off the shelves because we don't need any more accidents like this.\u201d Adults, too, have been testing their spice tolerance. Joaquin Diaz, a 31-year-old construction worker from the Bronx, in New York, said he tried the chip a few weeks ago after coming across social media videos about the challenge. He said he loves spicy food and wanted to see how he'd stack up. Diaz told The Associated Press by phone Friday that the chip was very hot, but he didn\u2019t expect the stomach cramps and diarrhea that followed and led to him missing work the next day. \u201cIt hurt, I\u2019m not gonna lie. I was actually a little nervous,\u201d he said. Despite the stomach issues, Diaz said he had planned to try the chip again with some friends. But he decided not to after he heard about Wolobah's death. Roger Trier, a 56-year-old content creator and graphic designer from Palatine, Illinois, posted video on TikTok and YouTube of himself completing a 100-chip challenge this month. He told the AP that he has trained for over 20 years to build up his spice tolerance. \u201cMost people you see on social media \u2014 with any challenges \u2014 don\u2019t understand the consequences,\" he said. Trier said he thinks people under the age of 18 shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do spicy challenges without adult supervision because they might not know how to deal with the intense reactions the food can cause or the peer pressure that can push them to take risks they don't understand. Although the chip could still be bought in some stores as of Thursday, by Friday it had disappeared from the shelves of major retailers, including 7-Eleven and Walgreens. Amazon halted sales and was notifying customers who bought the product recently that Paqui was removing it. And eBay said it was blocking One Chip Challenge listings. Sales of the chip seem largely driven by people posting videos on social media of them or their friends taking the challenge. They show people, including children, unwrapping the packaging, eating the chips and then reacting to the heat. Some videos show people gagging, coughing and begging for water. Neither Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, Google, which owns YouTube, nor TikTok immediately replied to Friday requests for comment about whether they were taking any action. Paqui, a Texas-based subsidiary of , said in a statement posted on its website Thursday that it was \u201cdeeply saddened by the death\u201d of Wolobah. \u201cWe have seen an increase in teens and other individuals not heeding these warnings,\u201d the company said. \u201cAs a result, while the product continues to adhere to food safety standards, out of abundance of caution, we are actively working with retailers to remove the product from shelves.\u201d At the vigil Friday, a crowd of about 100, including many of Wolobah\u2019s friends and teammates, turned out to a park in Worcester, down the hill from his home.

It's not going to be your standard Circulon, Farberware or Hamilton Beach \u2014 but rather, something that is both timelessly durable, yet speaks to the current aesthetics of adulthood. I'm talking about Le Creuset , of course, the famed Instagram-friendly brand of bright colored pots, pans and sturdy Dutch ovens. Sure, the price tag attached to each signature item is enough to make many shudder (said Dutch oven in a 7.25-quart size runs about $368.99) but there's no denying the fact that Le Creuset has been sought out \u2014 and adored \u2014 by many. After all, the French enamel cookware company has managed to effortlessly blur the line between functional cookware and home decor. Some are in it for efficiency. Others, mainly for the visuals and design. That's what makes the brand so fascinating. In recent years, we've seen similar trendy brands crop up, both online and across big-box retail chains. There's the minimalist-themed Our Place , which is the maker behind the cult-favorite all-in-one nonstick Always Pan . There's the simplistic Phantom Chef , the eclectic Great Jones and the sleek-and-chic Material Kitchen . But none of them have been able to attain the fanbase or cultural significance that Le Creuset continues to revel in \u2014 but this isn't just among legacy home cooks or well-established homeowners. Le Creuset is quite popular amongst Gen-Zers, thanks partially to the online cottagecore trend, which branched away from Pinterest and found a new home on TikTok amid the pandemic. Now, the hashtag #LeCreuSlay occasionally trends on the platform as videos showing young influencers and cooks Le Creuset hauls have garnered over 84.2 million views; the brand itself has 2.1 million likes and over 200,000 followers. So what exactly is the appeal? Some may point to the brand's reputation as a wise investment if you're going to make a habit of cooking. Namely, it's that classic Dutch oven that has garnered the most acclaim from chefs, critics and home cooks. Take it from Insider's Connie Chen , who explained, \"Basically, Le Creuset is the rare brand that's really as good as everyone says it is. The experience is kind of like going to your first SoulCycle class \u2014 you enter a cynic, but you emerge (hopefully less sweaty) a zealous convert.\" Related Everything you need to know about Dutch oven cooking It's why so many cooking enthusiasts are willing to spend anywhere between $260 to $625 just to get their hands on a Dutch oven \u2014 and frankly, any kind of cookware from the brand. The quality is top-notch. The longevity is stellar. And yes, the excellent craftsmanship is an added perk. As Mary Claire Lagroue of Food & Wine wrote, \"What sets Le Creuset apart from others is quality, performance (more on that later), and durability. The pieces are handmade, with the help of machines for smoothing, and multiple people inspect each one during production to ensure that it's as close to perfection as possible.\" Lagroue added that she's cooked with her own Le Creuset 7.25-quart round Dutch oven for an astounding four years. Her pots \u2014 one that belonged to her mother and another that she bought for herself \u2014 held up to high heat, scrubbing off stuck-on food, the dishwasher, and even a move across the country. It also helps that the pots are incredibly easy to clean and aren't prone to staining, despite their white interior. \"Le Creuset's 7.25-quart round Dutch oven is the one piece of cookware I'd recommend to anyone who's serious about cooking, regardless of their experience,\" Lagroue continued in her review. \"While the initial investment is higher, a well-made Dutch oven like this can last a lifetime if you treat it well.\" Le Creuset's fanbase also includes its avid super-collectors, who drop hundreds (even thousands) to stock up on items. That entails spending hours scouring the internet for online sales, raiding discount shops and hunting down vintage cookware. \"It can be a consuming, expensive and deeply personal hobby. To the obsessed, there's always another piece calling their name,\" wrote The Guardian's Jill Schildhouse . \"Each recipe requires a particular vessel, each season a suitable hue, and each dinner party a special display detail.\" However, it's worth remember that many Gen-Zers aren't living on their own. Nor are they necessarily cooking or hosting in the same way as millennials or Gen-Xers, so nostalgia is another key factor in Le Creuset's appeal. The brand's chip-resistant enameled cast iron means it can last for years (we're talking more than 40 years , in some instances), as long as it's treated properly with care. That can't be said for many conventional brand cookware, which are more likely to rust and scratch with increased use. Le Creuset, though, is a brand that can be passed down from generation after generation. And what's better than being able to cook your favorite comfort meal using a pan from your mother's kitchen and even, your grandmother's? We need your help to stay independent Subscribe today to support Salon's progressive journalism But in the end, Gen-Zers are also drawn to Le Creuset for the same reasons that their parents, as well as their parents, were. The nostalgia-inducing Dutch ovens, posts and pans are emblematic of adulthood. Historically, they belong in the kitchen of someone who has their life together enough to host actual dinner parties \u2014 or at least on the wedding registry of a couple who plans to entertain once they are finally settled. What does being settled look like in a country facing crippling inflation, pervasive housing crises and the looming threat of another global pandemic? Who really knows. That said, while some of the realities of adulthood have changed, Le Creuset hasn't. And as the adage says, old is new again \u2014 the recent fashion world obsession with \" quiet luxury \" is a prime example of this. So, how did Le Creuset, the self-described heirloom-quality cookware , become a new Gen-Z icon? The brand managed to create something that's practical but also, classically beautiful. Each and every piece is a cooking and art crossover, which is essential for success in a food world where \"the camera eats first.\" If you want your cookware to be able to whip up your favorite homemade stew, Le Creuset has just the items for you. And if you want your cookware to just sit pretty on your kitchen countertop, Le Creuset also has just the items for you. It's a versatile brand that essentially appeals to the pragmatic chef, art curator or Instagram influencer. Perhaps they'll make collectors of a new generation.
