Taylor\u2019s actions \u201crewrote the fate of four families for generations to come\u201d, Biden said at the award ceremony. When Biden lands at Hanoi\u2019s Noi Bai International Airport on Sunday, he steps into a very different Vietnam and a phenomenally changed relationship with an old war foe. Biden is scheduled to meet the most senior leaders of Vietnam\u2019s Communist Party \u2013 the political organisation that was once an enemy \u2013 and is expected to sign agreements that elevate US relations to the highest level possible with Hanoi. \u201cThis visit is a remarkable step in the strengthening of our diplomatic ties,\u201d US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said ahead of the visit. \u201cIt reflects the leading role that Vietnam will play in our growing network of partnerships in the Indo-Pacific,\u201d Sullivan said. Both countries, he also said, had laboured to overcome the \u201cpainful shared legacy\u201d of the war, which resulted in the deaths of millions of Vietnamese and 58,000 US service members. While diplomatic ties and trade are foremost in the scheduled meeting between Biden and Vietnam\u2019s most powerful figure, Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, Washington also has its eyes set on China, which is increasingly in the Asia Pacific region. China will be watching Biden\u2019s visit closely, too, weakens Beijing\u2019s influence in Hanoi or alters strategic interests with its southern neighbour. Vietnam and the US are already signatories to a \u201ccomprehensive partnership\u201d, and speculation has focused on the elevation of relations to the highest level of a \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership\u201d \u2013 the most senior level in Vietnam\u2019s diplomatic hierarchy, said Le Hong Hiep, senior fellow and coordinator of the Vietnam Studies Programme at the ISEAS \u2013 Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. If that were to occur during Biden\u2019s visit, it would \u201crepresent a remarkable breakthrough in bilateral ties\u201d, Hiep wrote recently in the ISEAS Fulcrum online magazine. Vietnam \u201conly forms such partnerships with those that it views as of great importance for its security, prosperity, and international standing,\u201d Hiep said. If the agreement is signed, Vietnam will be inviting Washington into a club of just four other comprehensive strategic partners: China, India, Russia, and South Korea. While concerns over a backlash from China are credible, upgrading ties to such a level with the US at this time \u201cmakes perfect sense\u201d for several reasons, Hiep said. Washington\u2019s commitment to keeping the Indo-Pacific maritime area free and open aligns with Vietnam\u2019s interests amid China\u2019s regional muscle flexing. The US is also Vietnam\u2019s second largest trading partner (after China), but the US is, importantly, the largest export market for Vietnamese goods. As Hiep notes, it would be a \u201csensible move for Hanoi\u201d to have closer ties with such an important business partner. Timing is also important. It would be better to make the move to elevate ties with Washington now, before US-China competition sours even further, which could place Vietnam in a more tenuous situation when it came to making such a choice. Nevertheless, closer ties with the US do not mark a major shift in Vietnam\u2019s \u201cstrategic trajectory\u201d, as it is in Hanoi\u2019s best interests to pursue a \u201cbalanced foreign policy towards the major powers\u201d. Nguyen Khac Giang, a scholar of Vietnamese politics and visiting fellow at ISEAS, said the US may place more significance on the upgrade in relations with Vietnam, in terms of a counterbalance to China, than Hanoi has in mind. Vietnam sees the agreement as serving a variety of goals, including the rejuvenation of a struggling economy and strengthening public faith in Vietnam\u2019s foreign policy, Giang told Al Jazeera. For Vietnam, the \u201cupgrade carries both symbolic and practical significance, serving a range of interests from geopolitical counterbalancing to initiatives for economic diversification, making it a calculated risk worth taking,\u201d he said. Vietnam has skilfully balanced its relations with larger powers and it is not about to abandon that approach now, said Carl Thayer, emeritus professor at the Australian Defence Force Academy at the University of New South Wales. What has changed, however, is that Vietnam sees the importance of deepening economic ties with the US when China\u2019s economy is \u201cin deep trouble\u201d and the global economy is slowing. not only hurt its own economy but also had a severe impact on Vietnam\u2019s \u2013 as China is Vietnam\u2019s largest trade partner. The elevating of relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership is \u201cmainly about economics and technology\u201d, Thayer said, adding that such a move is not Hanoi being drawn into \u201can anti-China alliance\u201d with the US. \u201cVietnam will not take a step, in my view, with the US that threatens China\u2019s core interest or give the impression that Vietnam is aligning against China,\u201d Thayer told Al Jazeera. Giang, the scholar of Vietnamese politics, also said the upgrade in relations with Washington will not harm Hanoi\u2019s core interests either. \u201cHanoi likely believes it has the tools to ensure the regime\u2019s ideological core remains untouched by potential US influences,\u201d Giang told Al Jazeera. \u201cI don\u2019t foresee this enhanced relationship threatening the one-party state, especially since Washington has signalled its respect for Vietnam\u2019s existing political system.\u201d", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 21:20:41", "image_url": null, "source_id": "aljazeera_us", "source_priority": 543, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "da40bc572702adeff74271a79b19e14c", "title": "US Supports Mideast-India Mega Transit Corridor: A Daring Rebuff To China's Belt & Road Initiative?", "link": "https://www.benzinga.com/markets/asia/23/09/34395775/us-supports-mideast-india-mega-transit-corridor-a-daring-rebuff-to-chinas-belt-road-initiative", "keywords": ["Asia", "Europe", "Middle East", "News", "Transit", "US", "Emerging Markets", "Markets", "News", "Asia", "Emerging Markets", "Markets", "Benzinga"], "creator": null, "video_url": null, "description": "The U.S. read more", "content": "The U.S. has reportedly signed an agreement with India, Middle Eastern countries and the European Union to connect them via a network of railways and sea routes, according to Bloomberg .

The U.S.-backed plan will connect Middle Eastern nations via rail networks and link India through maritime routes from provincial ports, further stretching toward Eastern Europe. A Push Back Against China's Belt And Road Initiative? The development comes amid China's dominance in the energy-dense region, pitting the U.S.' own initiative against the China's Belt and Road Initiative . Since January, the U.S. has quietly held talks about the project with India, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Israel, according to Bloomberg. In recent times, both the U.S. and EU have been aiming to offset President Xi Jinping 's Belt and Road Initiative, a project that has pumped hundreds of billions into infrastructure development in burgeoning economies. Some U.S. experts believe that Chinese companies and banks working on the Belt and Road projects don't follow global rules and sometimes act dishonestly.

The Middle East-India Rail & Shipping Corridor In Detail The project's span will cover a total distance of more than 3,000 miles, the Wall Street Journal reported. The corridor will be bypassed across UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Israel, leading to more rapid transit of goods. While Israel isn't anticipated to be a primary contributor in constructing the corridor, its position along the pathway would foster a closer relationship with Saudi Arabia. This reportedly aligns with the White House's efforts to regularize ties between the two nations. U.S. officials didn't specify a completion date, but Biden's senior adviser, Amos Hochstein, mentioned that the nations would convene in 60 days to deliberate on the timeline. The proposed transit route would also enhance ties between Washington and Riyadh, which have faced tensions over matters like human rights. Trans-African Corridor Across Copper Belt The U.S. and the EU will also support a pan-African corridor for transport links between the Democratic Republic of Congo's Katanga zone and Zambia's renowned \"Copper Belt,\" extending to the Lobito port in Angola, according to Bloomberg.

While China has sent a delegation led by Vice Premier Liu Guozhong to the North Korea\u2019s anniversary celebrations, Russia sent a military song and dance group.

Photos showed Kim smiling and talking with his young daughter, believed to be named Ju Ae, as they watched the parade from leather chairs set up at Kim\u2019s balcony in Kim Il Sung Square named after his state-founding grandfather.

[+] photograph of a man, with facial features identified and facial bounding boxes present, San Ramon, California, November 22, 2019. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Getty Images I spent the start of the week at the imposing Stormont building in Belfast. It has been the centre of power in Northern Ireland for nearly one hundred years, and hosts Northern Ireland\u2019s Assembly, which notoriously now has not sat for over a year, something the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland would like to see rectified Notwithstanding this the local economy is strong (unemployment is 2.7%) and this weekend there will be a US led investment conference in the city, which amongst many other things, demonstrates the economic dividend of falling geopolitical risk. Unfortunately, Northern Ireland is very much the outlier here, as geopolitical risk is on the rise across the international spectrum. One of the sharpest reminders that we are in a \u2018war by other means\u2019 environment is the ongoing \u2018Chip Wars\u2019, the latest salvo of which involved the Chinese government banning the use of iPhones by government employees (presumably as a form of leverage over the USA at the same time as Huawei is launching a new flagship phone). EU AI Act Despite this I have found the lack of interest by European firms (large and medium sized) in geopolitics to be striking. In markets, geopolitical risk has rarely been a major factor over the past forty years, owing to the tailwind of globalisation (no wars amongst democracies and emerging markets have been on a path to growth). The events that signalled the cracks in globalisation \u2013 Brexit and the Trump trade war \u2013 were risks that investors needed to measure. In addition, as inflation has risen, the absence of quantitative easing has made markets more sensitive to geopolitical risk.

Is A Calculated Bet To Fund Troubled Startups The First Step? New Pixel 8 Pro Leaks Reveal Google s Smart Decision In today\u2019s multipolar world where strategic competition is increasingly the norm, geopolitical risks loom large\u2013 from the risk that Donald Trump comes close to re-election, to the drive of Chinese technology into Europe (BYD cars have arrived) to the re-alignment of the European defense, aerospace and greentech industries owing to the war in Ukraine. Many of these risks are events that require a response and readjustment, others are more existential. One important source of risk is the way governments react to landmark technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI). The ways in which the use (and abuse of these technologies) is framed and watched over can determine the shape of the industries of the future. As an early mover on regulation, Europe\u2019s response to AI is the EU AI Act, whose main contribution is to divide the application of AI into four pillars from harmless to very harmful (akin to China\u2019s use of AI for social credit scoring). The fact that Europe has moved first sets the bar for other regulatory initiatives on AI, notably that being pursued by Chuck Schumer in the US and Japan\u2019s G7 level \u2018Hiroshima\u2019 paper on AI. Confusion One area of vibrant debate, and some confusion, that has opened up is that way in which companies \u2013 software, media, data firms \u2013 who do not necessarily \u2018generate\u2019 AI content formally but are at the centre of many of its processes, are treated. The extent to which they will be policed by the AI Act is not clear and we have not yet had detail forthcoming from the EU. Indeed, it may well be up to individual companies to try to take the lead within their own industries for setting out the ways in which they will treat and use AI (telecoms, retailers with large datasets for example). An additional source of confusion lies in the use of AI by start-up firms, especially out of France (ironically), which is striving to become an AI innovation centre (it has a rich labour market here and the backing of key entrepreneurs). Their argument is that the Act might constrain innovation by new firms. One response to this may well be a \u2018sandbox\u2019 system where young companies are allowed to innovate in a regulatory sandbox, to a certain level of commercialisation. A related issue that is bubbling up is access to models (and data) for researchers, and whether we might begin to see more EU coordination on this. We also need more detail on governance. It may well be that there is a top-level AI Office at the EU level, with then individual state AI Offices, or to make matters more complicated some countries may argue to have an AI office for sub-sectors (AI in telecoms, AI in banking for instance). This is not yet resolved. A sure sign that AI is becoming the terrain of competition between the large nations is that the UK is trying to become the \u2018locus\u2019 of AI regulation, in the sense that it is signalling that it wants to be the coordinator of international regulatory activity, and in the same way as Geneva hosts the WHO, WTO, it wants to be the locus of AI standards. The AI Summit at Bletchley (Nov. 1 st and 2nd) will be an important milestone here. If the UK was to physically host an international regulatory body, why not have it in Northern Ireland?

The Friday event featured Pyongyang's \"paramilitary forces\", state media said, rather than soldiers in the regular army, and it did not appear to showcase the country's banned weaponry including intercontinental ballistic missiles. Images in state media showed uniformed paramilitary brigades, including some riding tractors or in large red trucks, as Kim, flanked by his young daughter, looked on smiling and clapping. Kim Il Sung Square \"was full of excitement and joy of the spectators significantly celebrating the birthday of their great powerful country\", the official Korean Central News Agency reported. \"All the participants paid the highest glory and warmest thanks to Kim Jong Un, peerless patriot and ever-victorious iron-willed commander.\" Kim met with the visiting Chinese delegation led by Liu Guozhong, vice-premier of the State Council, the second such visit by top officials from Beijing in six weeks, as Pyongyang shows signs of easing its strict Covid-era border controls. The two sides announced their aims of \"further intensifying the multi-faceted coordination and cooperation\" between the two countries, according to a separate KCNA report. Russian diplomats also attended the event, as well as a Russian military song-and-dance ensemble which had arrived in Pyongyang to mark the occasion, KCNA reported. Moscow expanded its official presence in North Korea shortly before the parade, with its Pyongyang embassy saying this week that it had been allowed to bring in 20 diplomatic and technical staff -- the first such rotation of personnel since 2019. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent Kim a message marking the anniversary, KCNA said Saturday, in which he called for the two countries to \"expand the bilateral ties in all respects\". And according to Chinese state media, President Xi Jinping \"extended congratulations in a call to Kim Jong Un\" on the anniversary. Friday's event was the nuclear-armed state's third parade this year. The last one -- a military parade featuring the country's most advanced weaponry -- took place in late July to commemorate the signing of an armistice that ended hostilities in the 1950-53 Korean War. The Chinese and Russian visits come as speculation mounts that Kim -- who rarely leaves his country and has not travelled since the coronavirus pandemic started -- will meet Putin to discuss arms deals. US and other officials told The New York Times that Kim is likely to head by armoured train later this month to Vladivostok, on Russia's Pacific coast not far from North Korea, to meet Putin. \"Whether or not a Putin-Kim summit soon follows, the United States is attempting to deter serious violations of international law by preemptively releasing intelligence,\" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. Growing cooperation between China, Russia and North Korea, coupled with Xi skipping the G20 Summit in India, \"give the appearance of a widening fissure in Asia's geopolitical landscape\", he said. \"Most stakeholders in the region want to avoid a new Cold War, but this looks increasingly difficult as Beijing and Moscow prop up Pyongyang and North Korea aligns itself with China and Russia's challenges to the international order.\" Though, he added: \"A major Russia-North Korea arms deal, in breach of numerous international sanctions, should worry Beijing.\" The parade came two days after Pyongyang unveiled its first \"tactical nuclear attack submarine\", with Kim declaring it part of a \"push forward with the nuclear weaponisation of the Navy\", although the South Korean military said the vessel might not be operational. North Korea has conducted a record number of weapons tests this year, and last month failed in its second attempt to put a spy satellite into orbit. South Korea and the United States have ramped up security cooperation in response.

While has sent a delegation led by Vice Premier Liu Guozhong to the North Korea\u2019s anniversary celebrations, Russia sent a military song-and-dance group. South Korean media speculated that the lack of Russian government officials at the festivities in Pyongyang could be related to preparations for a summit between Kim and Putin, which Washington expects within the month. According to some U.S. reports, a summit could happen as early as next week. is expected to attend an international forum that runs from Sunday to Wednesday in the eastern Russian city of Vladivostok, which also was the site of his first summit with Kim in 2019 and now is seen as a possible venue for their next meeting. South Korea\u2019s spy agency told lawmakers in a closed-door briefing Thursday that North Korea and Russia also could be arranging an unexpected \u201csurprise\u201d route for Kim\u2019s visit to avoid potential venues reported by the media. North Korea has not confirmed any plans for Kim to visit Russia. \u201cWhether or not a Putin/Kim summit soon follows, the United States is attempting to deter serious violations of international law by preemptively releasing intelligence,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. The growing cooperation between China, Russia and \u2014 plus Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s decision to skip the Group of 20 Summit in India \u2014 give the appearance of a widening fissure in Asia\u2019s geopolitical landscape, he said. Still, a major Russia-North Korea arms deal, which would breach numerous international sanctions, should worry Beijing because \u201cassociation with an emerging pariah state bloc could have negative repercussions for China\u2019s globalized but struggling economy,\u201d Easley said. The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Kim received letters from Putin and Xi on the anniversary, in which both leaders said their countries\u2019 strengthening ties with North Korea would contribute to the region\u2019s peace and stability. Saturday\u2019s parade was centered on paramilitary organizations and public security forces protecting Pyongyang, rather than the military units that handle his weapons systems, which have been the focus of other parades this year. State media did not mention whether Kim made a speech during the parade, indicating that he likely didn\u2019t. KCNA said Kim met with Liu and other Chinese delegates ahead of the parade, where they exchanged views on \u201cfurther intensifying the multi-faceted coordination and cooperation\u201d between the countries. Tensions in the Korean Peninsula are at their highest point in years, as the pace of both North Korea\u2019s missile tests and the United States\u2019 combined military exercises with South Korea and Japan have intensified in tit-for-tat. To counter the deepening security cooperation between Washington, Seoul and Tokyo, Kim has been trying to boost the visibility of his partnerships with Moscow and Beijing as he seeks to break out of diplomatic isolation and have North Korea be a part of a united front against the United States.

Israel\u2019s hardline coalition seems unlikely to accede to Riyadh\u2019s requirements that it never annex the West Bank or establish new settlements, in line with the Biden Administration\u2019s efforts to foster such a peace agreement. Meanwhile, Riyadh has undertaken something of . A peace agreement that would complicate Saudi Arabia\u2019s d\u00e9tente with Iran hardly appears to be in the offing. Yet Israel and the Saudi kingdom do not have an all-or-nothing approach. Media of security cooperation between the two countries has become routine. The signs of eventual normalized relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia are already visible. While Iran has punished its athletes for simply associating with Israelis, the Saudis have allowed Israeli and to compete in the kingdom. Furthermore, both Israel and Saudi Arabia back interim steps that can lead to full normalization. These include, for example, the prospect of Israel developing an . This could position Israel and Saudi Arabia at the center of valuable trade route that would link Europe to the Gulf, and via Saudi ports create a link to India and Asia. The Biden administration likely had this in mind during U.S. National Security advisor Jake Sullivan\u2019s in Riyadh with his Saudi, Emirati, and Indian counterparts. A regional economic and trade bloc would extend to the sphere of defense and security as well. In February 2023, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced it was setting up a network of information sharing and cyber security resilience to promote cybersecurity for Israel and Sunni Gulf States. This is just the start. Saudi Arabia is seeking to forge a NATO-style security treaty in which the U.S. would be obligated to come to its defense in the event of an Iranian attack. As part of this treaty, Saudi Arabia would purchase the American Terminal High Altitude Area Defense antiballistic missile defense system, which could be used to shore up its defenses against Iran\u2019s growing missile arsenal. Although Saudi recognition of Israel would complicate Riyadh\u2019s\u2019 efforts to establish d\u00e9tente with Tehran, a security treaty styled after NATO could in the future bring together the U.S., Israel, and Sunni States and deter Iranian aggression. Israel hopes that a U.S. security guarantee to Riyadh could obviate its ambition for a civilian nuclear program monitored and backed by the U.S. This is due to Israel\u2019s concern of the prospect of a civilian nuclear reactor being converted for military applications. To this end, Israel\u2019s Foreign Minister Eli Cohen reportedly that, \u201c[A] defense pledge could reassure Middle Eastern nations, primarily Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states.\u201d Moreover, he continued, \u201cthis approach would make individual nuclear ambitions unnecessary, bolster regional stability, and promote the peace and normalization agenda.\u201d Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer went even further declaring Israel\u2019s willingness to drop objections to a Saudi civilian nuclear program as part of a peace agreement with Riyadh. Israel is well aware that Saudi Arabia can turn to China to develop a nuclear program and would rather it be developed by the U.S. on its own terms. In 2020, China was advancing its and the . China has its building of a in Abu Dhabi as part of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberal Army plans to build a global military network. Beijing also assisted Riyadh\u2019s development of its and manufacturing its own . China is also Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest trading partner, and China\u2019s Belt Road Initiative is contributing to the Gulf\u2019s digital transformation. China aims to embed itself in the region\u2019s infrastructure by investing in advanced technologies such as clean energy, which could be incorporated into Gulf economic diversification efforts. In testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, commander of U.S. Central Command, asserted in March 2023 that the U.S. was \u201c .\u201d Kurilla , \u201cThe People\u2019s Republic of China has chosen to compete in the region. The PRC is aggressively expanding its diplomatic, informational, military and economic outreach across the region.\u201d A peace agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel would contribute to broader U.S. geopolitical ambitions of keeping China (and state-connected Chinese firms such as Huawei) out of the Middle East, making Saudi Arabia more reliant on U.S. weapons, and preventing Beijing from establishing a military base on Saudi soil. This will require a coordinated U.S. government strategy approach towards the Middle East. BIden\u2019s appointment of a Special Envoy for the Abraham Accords is a step in the right direction. As opposed to China\u2019s approach of offering infrastructure development via its BRI and debt trap diplomacy in the Middle East, the Biden Administration seeks to advance the sustainable development of infrastructure in a transparent manner. The U.S. aims to achieve this by fostering healthy interdependency between states via free trade agreements. The Biden administration\u2019s approach of vertical expansion is to deepen economic benefits to citizens of partnering countries. The U.S. Development Finance Corporation is also offering loan guarantees to incentivize U.S. companies to invest in developing markets. This approach is far more transparent than China\u2019s. Development Finance Corporation projects in Asia and Latin America could be replicated in the Middle East for lower-income countries. This would lead the U.S. to work with partners across the Middle East on projects that can create prosperity in poorer countries such as Jordan. In the long run, a common market in the Gulf, coupled with increased security, defense and intelligence ties across the region could offset Iranian influence. The momentum toward normalization and ultimately a peace agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia is not going to be determined by their respective domestic policies or local concerns. Rather, a peace agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia will emerge from their continued incremental progress toward normalization to create markets and security frameworks. This may come together within broader geopolitical concerns, such as U.S.-China competition to extend influence in the Gulf and across the Middle East.", "pubDate": "2023-09-08 16:00:00", "image_url": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/AP17172472405218.jpg?w=900", "source_id": "thehill", "source_priority": 393, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["world"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "801db1892730c4a07ad258381705dc1a", "title": "Arundhati Roy: \u2018Biden, Macron know what\u2019s going on in India but won\u2019t talk\u2019", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/8/arundhati-roy-biden-macron-know-whats-going-on-in-india-but-wont-talk?traffic_source=rss", "keywords": ["News"], "creator": null, "video_url": null, "description": "From her New Delhi home, acclaimed Indian writer and activist talks about G20 summit and state of India's minorities.", "content": "India is preparing to host world leaders at a Group of 20 (G20) summit this weekend in what is being described as a crucial moment for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to cement his place as a global leader. New Delhi has gone under a massive \u2013 and controversial \u2013 \u201cbeautification drive\u201d for the event, with many and their occupants displaced. Newly-painted lotus flower murals \u2013 the election symbol of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) \u2013 have appeared and billboards with Modi\u2019s face line the reworked roads. \u201cYou\u2019d be forgiven for thinking it was the BJP that was hosting this event, not the government of India,\u201d acclaimed author and activist Arundhati Roy told Al Jazeera. Roy, 61, is a vocal critic of the Indian government\u2019s treatment of minorities \u2013 mainly its 200 million Muslims \u2013 and other rights violations since Modi came to power in 2014. From her home in New Delhi, she spoke to Al Jazeera about the G20 event and the state of India\u2019s minorities. Look, I don\u2019t think anybody really cares about that because\u2026 the G20 is here, everybody is looking for an opportunity, a trade deal or a military equipment deal or a geopolitical strategic understanding. So it\u2019s not as if any single one of the people who are coming here, the heads of state or anyone else doesn\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going on in India. In countries like the US and the UK and France, the mainstream media has been so critical of what\u2019s happening in India, but the governments have a different agenda altogether. So I don\u2019t think one needs to be naive enough to believe that that is an issue at all for the people coming here. It won\u2019t. None of them will. I have no such expectation. But I think what\u2019s interesting is that if you were in Delhi, as I am now, if you look at the publicity, if you look at the banners, if you look at all the preparations that are being made for the G20, you would be forgiven for imagining that it wasn\u2019t the government of India that is hosting the G20, but the BJP. Every single banner has a huge lotus on it, which is the symbol of a political party. Modi\u2019s BJP. What has happened in India and it\u2019s so dangerous, so blatant, is that the country, the nation, the government and its institutions have all been conflated with the ruling party \u2013 a political party. And that ruling party has been conflated with Modi, the individual. In fact, there is hardly any ruling party now, there\u2019s just a ruler. So it\u2019s as if Modi is hosting the G20. All of us are locked in. We can\u2019t go out. The poor have been purged from the city. The slums have been screened off. The roads are barricaded, the traffic is shut down. It\u2019s as quiet as death. It is as if he\u2019s so ashamed of all of us, of what the city is really like. It\u2019s been purged and locked down for this event. Of course it\u2019s a vanity event. He\u2019ll pirouette and it\u2019s just before the elections. So it will feed into his campaign. All these Western leaders who speak about democracy \u2013 I mean, you can forgive someone like Trump because he doesn\u2019t believe in democracy \u2013 but Biden, Macron, all these people who talk about democracy, they know exactly what\u2019s going on here. They know that Muslims have been massacred, that Muslims who protest have their homes bulldozed, which means all the public institutions \u2013 courts, magistrates, the press \u2013 collude in that. They know that Muslims in certain towns have X marks on their doors and are being asked to leave. They know that Muslims have been ghettoised. And that now people who are accused of actually lynching, murdering Muslims are leading so-called religious processions through these ghettos. They know that vigilantes are out there with swords, calling for annihilation, calling for the mass rape of Muslim women. They know all this, but that doesn\u2019t matter because as always with certain Western countries, it\u2019s like \u201cdemocracy for us\u201d and, you know, \u201cdictatorship or whatever else it is for our non-white friends\u201d. It doesn\u2019t matter. I would say that it would be foolhardy for you to think that a process in which a country of 1.4 billion people that used to be a flawed democracy \u2013 and is now falling into a kind of, well, I can only use the word fascism \u2013 is not going to affect the rest of the world, you\u2019re extremely wrong. What I say wouldn\u2019t be a cry for help. It would be to say, \u201cLook around at what you are, what you are actually helping to create.\u201d There was a moment in time in 2002 after the anti-Muslim Gujarat massacre \u2013 in which intelligence reports by countries like the UK actually held Modi responsible for what they called ethnic cleansing. Modi was banned from travelling to the US, but all of that is forgotten now. But he\u2019s the same man. And every time somebody allows him this kind of oxygen and this kind of space to pirouette and claim that only he could have brought these powerful people to India, that message magnified a thousand-fold by our servile new channels, it feeds into a kind of collective national insecurity, sense of inferiority and false vanity. It\u2019s blown up into something else that\u2019s extremely dangerous and that people should understand is not going to just be a problem for India. We have a situation where we are talking about one nation, one language, one election. But actually we are in a situation where you have one dictator, one corporation. Arundhati Roy What I meant was that, you know, in the last few years, we have actually spoken about the rise of the BJP, of Modi, of the RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the BJP\u2019s ideological mentor] \u2013 the mothership of the cult of Hindu Supremacy \u2013 of which Modi has been a lifetime member. We have, some of us, critiqued it politically, structurally. But now we are in a different situation altogether. Although we do have elections, I wouldn\u2019t call us a democracy anymore. But because we have elections, this message of Hindu supremacy has to be beamed out to 1.4 billion people in order to create a reliable constituency. So election season becomes extremely dangerous for minorities. What I meant by \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a different phase now\u201d is that it\u2019s no longer just the leadership that we must fear, but a section of this indoctrinated population that has made the streets dangerous for minorities. The violence is no longer limited to government-orchestrated pogroms. We are witnessing incident after incident of banal evil, as Hannah Arendt might have put it. The world saw the video of an ordinary little classroom in north India where the teacher, the principal of the school, gets a seven-year-old Muslim boy to stand up and has all the other Hindu children come up and slap him. We have a civil war unfolding in Manipur where the state government is partisan, the centre is complicit, the security forces do not have a chain of command. It\u2019s beginning to resemble what happened in the Balkans. We saw the horrifying sight of women being paraded naked and gang-raped. We learned that it was the Manipur police who handed the women over to the mob. We have, as I said before, people accused of murder, of lynching, of burning alive young Muslim men, now leading religious processions. We have a situation where the prime minister speaks on Independence Day about women\u2019s rights, but at that very moment, his government signs a pardon for the 14 men who gang-raped Bilkis Bano and killed 14 members of a family. And they are now respected members of society. These are men who had been convicted to life imprisonment by the highest court in the land. So we have a situation now where the constitution has been more or less set aside. If they win the election next year, in 2026, there\u2019s going to be what we call \u201cdelimitation\u201d, which is a kind of gerrymandering where the number of seats and geography of constituencies will be changed and the Hindi speaking belt where the BJP is the strongest, will get more seats, which will basically change the balance of power. The south will definitely be very, very uneasy with this and that too has the power of or the potential of Balkanisation. We have a situation where, you know, we are talking about one nation, one language, one election. But actually, we are in a situation where you have one dictator, one corporation. We have a corporate head who has been an old friend of Modi\u2019s from the time of the Gujarat pogrom, who now is accused by not just not just a short selling company called the Hindenburg Research, but now by a whole coalition of journalists who report organised crime, talking about him pulling off the biggest corporate sort of scandal in history. But nothing will be done. So we\u2019re in a situation where the world also has to assess what happens when the rules don\u2019t apply to some people and apply differently to other people. All the rules. You know, we have a rule of law. We have a very sophisticated jurisprudence. But how it\u2019s applied depends on what your religion is, what your caste is, what your gender is, what your class is. We are in a very, very dangerous place. I don't think anybody expects anybody outside of India to stand up and take notice because all their eyes have dollar signs in them, and they are looking at this huge market of a billion people. But, you know, there won't be a market when this country slides into chaos and war. Arundhati Roy The state of India is very precarious, very contested. We have a situation in which the constitution has been effectively set aside. We have a situation in which the BJP is now one of the richest political parties in the world. And all the election machinery is more or less compromised. And yet \u2013 not just because of the violence against minorities, which of course causes a kind of majoritarianism and may not cause them to lose elections \u2013 but because of unemployment and because we live in one of the most unequal societies in the world, we have an opposition that is building up. This government is seeking to crush it because it does not believe that there should be an opposition. We are in a situation of great flux and we don\u2019t expect, I don\u2019t think anybody expects, anybody outside of India to stand up and take notice because all their eyes have dollar signs in them, and they are looking at this huge market of a billion people. But, you know, there won\u2019t be a market when this country slides into chaos and war, as it already has in places like Manipur. What they don\u2019t realise is that this market won\u2019t exist when this grand country falls into chaos as it is. The beauty and the grandeur of India are being reduced to something small and snarling and petty and violent. And when that explodes, I think there\u2019ll be nothing like it.", "pubDate": "2023-09-08 11:57:05", "image_url": null, "source_id": "aljazeera_us", "source_priority": 543, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}], "nextPage": null}
