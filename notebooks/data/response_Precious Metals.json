Made of tough ABS plastic, they feature a rust iron finish and protective coating with reviewers commenting on their durability no matter the weather. They install easily, cost under $20, and immediately transform a run-of-the-mill garage door into a thing of neighborly envy. 28 An Elegant Glass Teapot for A Refined Daily Ritual Instead of your average bags in cups, imagine brewing looseleaf tea in this gorgeous that extracts every bit of flavor and allows for an aesthetically pleasing daily ritual. It\u2019s constructed of borosilicate glass that can be used both on the stovetop and in the microwave. The stainless steel filter features fine laser-cut holes to filter out even the smallest tea leaf particles. Plus, because it\u2019s made of glass, the teapot won\u2019t carry over any odors or flavors from one brew to the next. 29 The Vintage Wood Wallpaper That Adds Immediate Warmth & Texture If you thought walls made of weathered wood reminiscent of a Cape Cod cottage were a complete pipe dream, think again. This $5 features an authentic weathered wood design, as if years of salt, spray, and sun had done their job. It can be easily cut to size and mounts quickly using self-adhesive to smooth, clean surfaces. Apply it to walls, dressers, or side tables knowing it won\u2019t damage the surface and will remove just as easily if the mood for change strikes. 30 A String of LED Mirror Lights to Glamorize The Bathroom Not only will these make makeup application that much more precise, but they also add a touch of old Hollywood glamour to your daily routine. They mount using an adhesive backing and can be cut to easily accommodate the size of your mirror. Plug the string of lights into your nearest outlet and use the built-in dimmer to adjust the brightness for the perfect Hollywood glow. 31 The Bathroom Storage Cabinet That Brings Function to Small Spaces This ingenious is designed to make perfect use of those narrow and too-small areas that you previously considered useless space. It\u2019s available in three different heights and provides shelves to store bathroom accessories, cosmetics, and cleaning products, for example. A top shelf is designed especially for toilet paper and there\u2019s even a platform on which to place your phone. Choose from different finishes such as white, black, or bamboo, and assemble it within minutes. 32 A Set of Throw Pillow Covers to Bring A Fresh Look to Old Furniture At only $14 for the pair, these act as one of the easiest ways to jazz up tired, old sofas or chairs. They\u2019re designed with a trendy geometric pattern and are made with a bit of velvet for a soft and luxurious feel.

It comes in three different sizes and is made with a rustic wooden frame that resembles an antique store hidden gem. Choose from seven available finishes such as retro white, natural wood, or dark brown, and lean it against your wall or mount it using the included hanging hardware. 34 These Multicolor Picture Frames for A Captivating Gallery Wall All you need for the perfect gallery wall is this collection of 10 that come in three different finishes (black, brown, and gray) for an attractive display. The frames come in three different sizes to accommodate a variety of photos and artwork and can be hung vertically or horizontally depending on your preference. Thankfully, gallery prices don\u2019t apply as this whole set will only cost you $31. 35 A Set of Outdoor String Lights to Create A Festive Atmosphere These popular have over 56,000 reviews and are a perfect way of dialing up an immediately festive ambiance for a $16 investment. It comes in lengths ranging from 25 to 100 feet with the glass bulbs designed in a chic globe shape and sporting an exposed filament. Not only are they completely dimmable, but they can also withstand all kinds of weather, making for a convivial atmosphere all year long. 36 These Turkish Hand Towels for Fashionable Functionality Just because these are stunningly beautiful, doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t also provide great functionality in the kitchen or bathroom. They\u2019re made of 100% cotton that\u2019s both soft and absorbent and which promises to dry fast without accumulating any musty odor. They come in a range of beautiful colors, all featuring a herringbone weave, and are lightweight enough to be conveniently portable. 37 A Pair of Vanity Light Fixtures to Make Your Bathroom Stand Out Make a visual impact for less than $30 with these stylish and highly rated that boast a vintage design.

Pair them with classic Edison bulbs to complete the look and mount them easily using the accompanying hardware and manual. 38 This Corkboard That Can Help You Easily Display Your Accomplishments Whether it helps you tidy up your home office, or just serves as a great place to showcase the work your kids have done in school, this versatile makes for an easy and convenient home upgrade. Available in both white and black, this board has been designed to securely hold push pins, thanks to the dense material that\u2019s underneath the cork itself. It\u2019s built to last, and is also a great option for classrooms. 39 A Shower Soap Dispenser for An Uncluttered Bath Get your body wash, shampoo, or conditioner off of the shower floor or side of the bath using this . It mounts to the wall with a strong, waterproof self-adhesive bracket and simply requires the push of a button to dispense the soap. A chrome-plated finish contributes to a clean look and a clear reservoir in either a wave or curved design shows exactly how much you have left before the need to refill. 40 This Cable Management Box That Hides Disorderly Cords If your power strip seems to be taking on a life of its own as it sprouts an overwhelming tangle of cords and cables, turn to this to get the chaos under control.

Plus, you won\u2019t mind having this box take up visual space with its modern design and minimalist natural wood cover.

There's never enough food, flashlights, batteries, or fuel to go around once you hear of an impending hurricane, blizzard, or wildfire, because everyone else in town is going to out fighitng over the same limited stock of items. It's better to stock up in advance and avoid the battle royal. Forget the milk and eggs. We've rounded up all the essentials for your emergency kit. Be sure to check out more guides to keep your home stocked and yourself prepared, such as How to Build a Home Tool Kit , Essentials You Need to Keep In Your Car , Best Multi-Tools , and How to Winterize Your Home . Updated September 2023: We've swapped headlamps, AM/FM radios and small stoves, as well as adding an insulated water bottle, a hammer, and a summer sleeping bag.

The Fenix E20 V2 for $45 is my top pick for an affordable emergency flashlight, but the ThruNite Archer 2A V3 for $30 is another solid choice. At 350 and 500 lumens, respectively, they're bright enough while remaining compact, and they last long on lower-light settings\u2014200 hours at 5 lumens for the Fenix and 51 hours at 17 lumens for the ThruNite. Both use two AA batteries, and in an emergency your main concern is to have a good supply of replacement batteries. If you're using alkaline batteries, remove them from the flashlight if it's going to sit unused for a long time, otherwise they'll leak and cause problems. Store them near the flashlight so you can easily find them. Try taping the batteries to the flashlight barrel. Pro tip: The best-performing flashlights are built specifically to use lithium-ion batteries or have nonremovable rechargeable batteries, which won't do you any good if the power is out for a long time. Rechargeable nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) AA batteries maintain their performance better over the lifetime of the battery, whereas alkalines\u2019 performance drops off more as they deplete, so buy some Panasonic Eneloops for $43 . They're better for the environment, but if they run out of charge you can still use regular alkaline AAs. You may prefer to keep a headlamp handy. The Black Diamond Astro 300 for $20 runs on three easily found AAA batteries and has three brightness settings, the brightest of which throws 300 lumens. That's more than powerful enough for tasks outside the home, while you can squeeze 140 hours of runtime out of the lowest setting for general tasks indoors. Coleman 4D LED Camp Lantern Coleman discontinued our previous favorite pick, the Divide+ Push Lantern, so the Coleman 4D LED Camp Lantern for $22 is the next-best choice for not a lot of coin. Flashlights do a poor job when you need to light up a whole room or if you need your hands free for a task. This basic lantern offers a single setting of 54 lumens, with a runtime of 175 hours on four D-cell batteries. That sounds like a lot, but next to other full-size battery-powered lanterns, such as the Coleman Twin LED lantern that uses eight D cells, it's economical. Fifty-four lumens is not what I'd call bright, but it is plenty bright enough for most tasks, even reading, while conserving battery life. If you want to save batteries or just prefer hanging out by gentle flickering candlelight, keep a spare emergency candle or two. The Coghlan's 36-Hour Survival Candle for $15 has three wicks that'll last for 12 hours each. Keep a lighter or some matches nearby. Lifestraw Go Water Bottle Most of the time, your water supply will work even when the power goes out. But major natural disasters can knock it out or damage it, and you might get dirty water. The LifeStraw Go Series Water Purifier Bottle for $45 marries the straw component of the LifeStraw Personal Water Filter with a BPA-free plastic bottle to filter out 99.99 percent of waterborne bacteria for up to 26 gallons of water. The original, bottle-less straw is still a good backup option for $17, and it'll filter up to 1,000 gallons. Another option is the Katadyn Steripen Adventurer for $120 , which purifies using ultraviolet light. Dunk it in your water and stir. It won\u2019t filter out sediment, but it\u2019s small, lightweight, and runs on replaceable CR123 batteries. You can also try Katadyn Micropur tablets for $16 . They're cheap and easy to store. Drop them in water and wait briefly. The taste isn\u2019t great, but no water-treatment tablets or droplets are, in my experience. If you have a large household, you may prefer something like the MSR AutoFlow XL Gravity Filter for $125 . Gravity filters take longer to purify water. You can boil water, but it won\u2019t filter out sediment, and boiling uses fuel and takes time. Coway Airmega 200M Wildfires are becoming an annual hazard, especially on the West Coast of the US, and they can spread dangerous amounts of particulate throughout the air. Homes aren't very airtight at all. Keep that toxic, carcinogenic junk out of your indoor air (and out of your lungs) by purchasing an air purifier for your home. The Coway Airmega 200M for $197 is my favorite affordable model for a small room, such as a bedroom or home office. For a larger room (up to 930 square feet), the Coway Airmega 250 for $400 is our top pick. Like the 200M, it has a smart setting that ramps up the filtering power automatically when needed; after several years of testing, both models are still going strong. Check out our Best Air Purifiers guide for more recommendations from the WIRED Gear Team. You probably already have some face masks at home, but if you don't and you live in a region susceptible to wildfires, you should pick up a box of disposable, medical-grade masks so you can breathe easier if the air becomes saturated with smoke. Fortunately, the best masks that protect against Covid-19 also protect well against smoke. We recommend the Powecom KN95 10-Pack for $12 . If these are out of stock, as many masks frequently are, check out our Best Disposable Face Masks guide. Coleman Gas Camping Stove Safety note: Don't use any of these stoves indoors. All of these fuels give off potentially deadly fumes that can accumulate and kill. Still made in the US, the classic Coleman Propane Camp Stove for $48 really hasn't changed much over the years. Propane is easy to use if you remember to stock up, and it's clean-burning. If propane is not your thing, get the Coleman Guide-Series Dual Fuel Camp Stove $198 . Camp fuel (also known as Coleman fuel and white gas) burns relatively cleanly, is easy to find for sale, and is an ideal camp stove fuel. You can also use gasoline in the Dual Fuel, but gasoline contains a lot of additives that gunk up the stove's internals, and you'll need to clean the stove out much more frequently. Get a Coleman Filtering Funnel for $11 if you purchase a liquid-fuel stove. The Sterno Outdoor Folding Camp Stove for $14 folds up so small that it's an easy option for people without room to keep a full-size stove around. It's an inexpensive backup that's handy to have, even if you've got a nice camp stove or a backpacking stove like an MSR Pocket Rocket for $85 . Our previous pick, the Jetboil Zip for $95 , is a fine stove for making single-serve hot drinks and soupy meals, but with the MSR you can use your regular cookware to make multiperson meals. It's not as fancy as the Colemans, but it's a lot easier to store in a crowded apartment. Make sure you grab an MSR IsoPro Fuel Canister for $11 . This large, 16-ounce size is best, in case the emergency lasts for several days. GSI Outdoors Pioneer Table Set Your regular cooking utensils, eating utensils, and metal, plastic, and wooden cookware can all be used during an emergency, but glass or ceramic drinking glasses and plates are a different case, as they can shatter. It'll be tough cleaning up the pieces with no power. When the lights go out, switch to this enameled steel dishware, such as the GSI Outdoors Pioneer Table Set for $130 . If somebody drops a piece, no big deal. Assuming your home's water supply is still working (and clean), the water will come out of the pipes somewhat cooler than the ambient air temperature. Having an insulated bottle will help conserve that precious coolness if you don't like drinking room-temperature water. The Klean Kanteen Insulated Classic for $34 is much easier to find for sale than the Miir\u2014the top pick in our Best Reusable Water Bottles guide\u2014and I found it remarkably durable. For more drinkware, check out our Best Insulated Travel Mugs guide. Stock up on items that don't require refrigeration and have long shelf lives. Rather than making a grocery run for eggs and milk, pick up foods such as instant rice, dried fruit, and oatmeal. If you don't have room for a camp stove or live in a busy city where it may be tough to cook outside when the power goes out, or if you just don't like to cook, pick up a Mountain House 3-Day Adventure Dehydrated Meal Kit for $105 . All you need to do is add water. If the power does go out, keep your refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible, to keep the stuff inside fresh for as long as possible. Leatherman Wave Plus For small jobs, a good do-it-all multi-tool such as the Leatherman Wave Plus for $120 is a lifesaver. When the lights are out and there's emergency gear spread out all over the home, it's especially annoying to keep going out to the garage to retrieve one tool after another. Carry them all in one tool in your pocket and cut the number of trips way down. If you only need a knife, the made-in-France Opinel No. 8 folding knife for $19 is an excellent choice. For such little money, the stainless steel blade\u2014which can be locked open or closed\u2014is remarkably sharp and well-shaped. Because it's so light, I often take it hiking instead of a chunkier knife. You may have to board up windows. Nails have increased sheer strength (that is, strength against forces perpendicular to the head). You'll need a good hammer. Since the slightly more affordable Plumb we recommend in my How to Build a Home Tool Kit guide is sold out, you may as well step up to my favorite hammer, the Vaughan 20-ounce Smooth Face Hickory-Handle Hammer, for $27 . Forget metal-handled hammers. They transit a lot of striking force to your hand through the handle. Fiberglass or wood is more forgiving. Pick up a pound or two of common nails while you're at it. You may need to repair items around the home, too, so it wouldn't hurt to have a good drill handy. The DeWalt 20V Max 1/2-Inch Cordless Drill for $99 is my favorite drill, and the best deal in cordless drills on the market. I recommend it for all homeowners, but it comes especially in handy when you have a lot of screws to drive in a hurry. A DeWalt 14-piece Screw Bit Set for $11 is a solid, affordable set of drill bits to use with your drill. It's difficult for most people to store a bunch of spare lumber in case of an emergency\u2014you'll just have to go to the hardware store to stock up at the earliest sign of trouble\u2014but it's easy to go ahead and store a big box of general purpose screws. Some 2-inch wood screws should do the trick. Make sure they're wood screws, which are designed specifically to go into wood. Some odds and ends will come in handy, too. Always keep a roll of duct tape for $8 handy, and a screwdriver in case your cordless drill runs out of power and you're unable to recharge it. A Channellock 6-in-1 Screwdriver for $8 has the main screwdriver bit sizes, both flathead and Phillips, and keeps everything compact by storing the bits inside itself. Mosey on over to our article How to Put Together a Home Tool Kit and our guide to the Best Multi-Tools for most information on preparing your home for natural disasters. Coleman Quick Bed Single High Airbed Mattress You'll need more beds if other folks stay with you during an emergency. Generally, I hate how inflatable mattresses deflate under my body weight by the early morning hours. The only exceptions I've found are Coleman mattresses, which have air nozzles designed to seal tighter when bodyweight is on top of the mattress. When I used the Quick Bed Single High Mattress Queen-Size for $53 last, I slept three nights before having to top it off with more air. Pick up a manual air pump if you don't already have a bicycle or sports pump. There's also the Coleman Pack-Away Camping Cot for $76 . Unlike most cots, this one doesn't have horizontal bars across the head and foot ends. Bars like that are evil. I've whacked my head and ankles on them enough for two lifetimes. You can use a rectangular sleeping bag (instead of a mummy bag) so that you have more room to stretch out. The Coleman Brazos 30 Sleeping Bag for $47 and Alps Mountaineering Crescent Lake 20F Sleeping Bag for $55 are solid options that won't break the bank. For warmer seasons when you might need something during cool nights, the Marmot NanoWave 55 Sleeping Bag for $79 is a personal favorite. It's rated to 55 degrees Fahrenheight and is just roomy enough not to feel constricting while also packing down into the size of a water bottle. Keep in mind that temperature ratings on sleeping bags are often overly optimistic, especially for women, who tend to sleep colder than men. Anker Portable Charger Anker makes my favorite power banks, which I use when traveling and during power outages to keep my phone topped off. That's important during emergencies for communicating with people. You can get by for days with a slim model like the Anker PowerCore Slim 10,000-mAh Portable Charger for $24 , but if you know you'll be on your phone much more or using an iPad, steer toward the PowerCore 26,800-mAh for $26 . Remember to check it periodically, pre-emergency, to keep it fully charged. Read our Best Portable Chargers guide for more. If you'd like to plan for longer emergencies, in situations where you may run down a battery bank before the power comes back on, consider the Powerfilm Solar Lightsaver for $200 . Barely the size of a small flashlight when rolled up, this compact solar panel charges fully in only six hours. Once it's charged, connect it via a USB cable to whichever device needs extra juice. It can also double as a standard battery bank if you charge it via a wall outlet, which takes about three hours with the included micro USB cable. You'll also want a portable radio, such as the Sony Portable AM/FM Radio for $40 , to hear weather reports and emergency broadcasts. Even if you don't ordinarily listen to terrestrial radio, you should have one and not rely on your phone. As with your flashlight, take the batteries out and store them with the radio. Fjallraven jacket Make sure you\u2019ve got warm clothing to wear indoors if the power goes out. The Uniqlo Fluffy Yarn Fleece Jacket ( men , women ) for $40 and REI Co-Op 650 Down Jacket 2.0 ( men , women ) for $100 are insanely warm, as are Uniqlo\u2019s Heattech long john tops ( men , women ) for $30 and bottoms ( men , women ) for $30 . If you end up outside cutting up trees and fixing busted fences after a disaster, you might not want to get your regular jacket torn up or muddy. My Carharrt Duck Sherpa-Lined Coat for $130 is very warm and very tough; I\u2019ve subjected it to all kinds of abuse. There's a similarly tough Carharrt Duck Sherpa-Lined Coat in women's sizing for $130 . Fjallraven is another tough outerwear brand that makes jackets we like. While you\u2019re at it, check out our gift guide for people who're always cold . Don\u2019t forget a cozy blanket, such as the L.L.Bean Wicked Plush Throw for $30 , and keep your feet warm with Glerups' Wool Slippers for $100 and Darn Tough wool socks for $23 . They're expensive, but they\u2019ve kept my feet warm through a few disasters. Hario Skerton Pro. Mr. Coffee and Keurig don't work when the power's out, but you'll still want your morning cup of joe. I'm one of WIRED's many coffee-worshiping zealots, and my favorite coffee grinder is the manual Hario Skerton Pro for $51 . Its base is made of thick glass that's survived more than a few drops onto my hardwood floor, and you can adjust the grind size to be suitable for anything from espresso to French press. For pour-overs, the ceramic Hario V60 Size 02 for $21 is perfect for making a big cup for one person at a time. If you do pour-over, you'll need to keep coffee filters for $6 around, and you'll need a gooseneck kettle to control the pour. The best stovetop one I've used is the Hario V60 Jino Gooseneck Kettle for $44. For French press, the Frieling 23-Ounce for $120 is my pick. It's double-wall insulated, so you won't burn your hands, and it's big enough to make a couple of big cups of coffee at a time. The AeroPress for $40 also comes highly recommended by another WIRED coffee addict. Check out our Best Insulated Travel Mugs and Best Portable Coffee Makers guides for more. Luggable Loo Your shower is likely to work just fine, but the Simple Shower Gravity Shower Kit for $12 is an inexpensive, compact backup if your home loses its supply of clean tap water. This kit screws onto a common soda bottle. Hang it upside down and it'll feed water onto the bather. You can use it anywhere, but you may as well set it up in your regular shower. If you hang it off the showerhead pipe, just make sure the weight won't tear it out of the wall or bend it. This product tends to go in and out of stock, so if it's currently unavailable, just keep an eye on the product page. Toilets usually will still flush fine in an emergency, and if they stop refilling you can flush a toilet by pouring water into the back tank (not the bowl). If your home's water supply is broken for days, eventually you'll need somewhere else to go. Buy a Luggable Loo Toilet Seat Lid for $16 and a 5-Gallon Bucket for $5 to construct a makeshift toilet. Don't forget waste bags for $14 to line the bucket. Keep a bag of kitty litter nearby, along with a cheap trowel for $6 for scooping it into the bucket after each use, extra toilet paper, and hand sanitizer. Champion Dual Fuel 3650-Watt Most of the time, you can get by without a generator and manage to stay warm, cook, and keep some lights on. You have to maintain generators, make sure you store enough fuel, and empty their tanks before they sit unused for a long time\u2014or use a fuel stabilizer for $9 . If you need a generator for medical equipment or think the luxury is worth the hassle, Honda makes excellent ones; Briggs & Stratton motors are solid too. But honestly, if you have to buy a big, hulking generator that\u2019ll sit unused most of the time, and you\u2019re watching your pennies, you can get by with a cheap one such as the Champion Dual Fuel 3650-Watt for $575 . Pro tip: Change the spark plug to a brand-name one as soon as you bring it home. The stock spark plugs that come with these Chinese generators tend to be junk. Just remember that gasoline spoils relatively quickly, needs to be prepared for inactivity with fuel stabilizers, and must be drained after a year. This is why, for most people, a generator isn't worth it (especially if you follow the rest of this guide). You should keep some spare gas around, as well. Whether you need it for your generator or your car, buy a fuel can that's made specifically for storing fuel safely. The Garage Boss Press N Pour for $28 will hold 5 gallons of gasoline and comes with a safety nozzle that only releases fuel when the spout is pressed to the gas tank opening. Just remember that cans are typically color-coded to the types of fuel they hold, in order to reduce the chance of costly or dangerous mix-ups. Gasoline goes in red canisters, and diesel goes in yellow . You probably have most of the medical essentials such as bandages and ibuprofen, but you should have a more robust medical kit for emergencies. Check out my guide on How to Make a First Aid Kit . It'll tell you how to build a bomber kit for less money than the storebought versions. If that sounds like a daunting task, the Adventure Medical Kits Mountain Series Explorer Medical Kit for $70 will cover the bases.. They also make medical kits that include directions for pets and their humans for $57 . If someone gets hurt badly, you might not be able to get to a hospital right away. It's a good idea to learn some first aid. You can take NOLS Wilderness First Aid courses through REI. From my experiences over the past four years, NOLS has fantastic instructors and a thorough hands-on curriculum. Natural disasters can be pretty boring during the non-panicky parts. Power outages involve lots of sitting around, so pick up a card game or a board game to play. I recommend Exploding Kittens for $20 to soothe everybody's nerves\u2014or aggravate them in an entertaining manner. It also has no small pieces to lose in the dark. For board games, check out one of our favorites: Ticket to Ride for $48 . Check out more of WIRED's Favorite Board Games for ways to pass the time during trying times.

The Rich Use This Income Secret (NOT Dividends) Far More Than Regular Investors", "content": "I\u2019ve made the argument here recently that gold prices have a real chance of breaking out of their multi-year range on a potential credit event. But where does that mean for silver, which is often referred to as \u201cpoor man\u2019s gold?\u201d One thing you can look at is a simple price ratio of silver to gold. This ratio can provide crucial insights into the relative value of these two metals and help guide your investment strategy. The silver-to-gold ratio is a simple concept that measures the relative value of silver to gold. You can calculate it by dividing the current price of silver by the price of gold. In essence, this ratio tells you how many ounces of gold it would take to purchase one ounce of silver at current market prices. The silver-to-gold ratio is more than just a mathematical calculation; it\u2019s a tool that can inform your investment strategy. It also has some interesting implications on expectations for economic activity. Gold is more of a risk-off asset, whereas silver more a signal of industrial global demand and output. Should You Buy Silver or Gold? If we look at two ETFs as proxies, iShares Silver Trust (NYSEARCA: SLV ) for silver and SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA: GLD ) for gold, we can see that for the last decade, silver has underperformed gold. Silver prices have been in a tight range all year. When the ratio is high (above the historical average), it suggests that silver is overvalued relative to gold. This could be an indication that it\u2019s a good time to buy gold or sell silver. Conversely, when the ratio is low (below the historical average), it may indicate that silver is undervalued relative to gold, suggesting an opportune time to buy silver or sell gold. From a technical standpoint, it looks like the ratio is right at the midpoint, meaning it\u2019s unclear which outperforms which here. Regardless, the two are co-moving here and could continue to do so as demand for precious metal diversification increases. So, do you buy silver or gold? I think there\u2019s a case for both here, although I lean more towards gold. Keep in mind that investors often see precious metals like gold and silver as hedges against inflation. If inflation expectations are high, both metals may see price increases, but the impact on the silver-to-gold ratio would depend on the relative price changes. The Bottom Line The bottom line here is simple. The silver-to-gold ratio offers valuable insights for those investing in these precious metals. It can serve as a guide for allocating resources between gold and silver and help identify potential investment opportunities. Silver has underperformed gold for a decade, and gold could outpace silver pushing the ratio lower on a flight-to-safety sequence in the yellow metal. This however still likely means silver does well, although it would underperform on a relative basis. I think, broadly speaking, diversifying in precious metals makes sense given where we are in the cycle, and some big movements could be on the horizon.

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Airport parking lots are common targets for thieves looking to steal catalytic converters. getty Airports, not surprisingly, are a common place targeted by car thieves, who have their pick of vehicles or get underneath cars and saw off valuable catalytic converters. Should the latter happen, you\u2019ll know as soon you start to drive off and you hear a loud roaring sound. When a car is parked at the airport, it\u2019s left for a long time, and there\u2019s a low chance that the owner will return and catch the thief in the act, explains Rick Musson, a 21-year law enforcement officer and q safety and security consultant with CarInsuranceComparison.com . Even more: \u201cThieves appreciate the lower risk of immediate theft discovery,\u201d Musson says. \u201cThe longer a thief has to move a stolen car, the less chance they\u2019ll be caught.\u201d Nationally, catalytic converter thefts have been on the rise, increasing by 1,215% between 2019 and 2022, according to National Insurance Crime Bureau Statistics. Airport parking lots are hot spots for this category of theft because they give thieves access to several cars all at once, so they can remove multiple catalytic converters in a spree, Musson says. Read on to learn how to prevent your car, and its catalytic converter, from being stolen from parking lots while you\u2019re out of town. MORE FOR YOU Ukrainian Brigades Were Advancing. Then They Ran Low On Bridgelayers. That 70s Show Star Danny Masterson Sentenced To 30 Years To Life For Rape Diarrhea All The Way Through Airplane Forces Delta Flight To Do U Turn How Are Airports Preventing Catalytic Converter and Car Theft? Airports across the country are stepping up security to prevent car and catalytic converter thefts from their lots. In Colorado, a leading state for car thefts, 378 vehicles were reported stolen from parking lots at Denver International Airport in the six-month period between Jan. 1 and July 31. To put things in perspective, more than 7 million vehicles parked in the airport\u2019s 51,000 spaces during that time period\u2014so chances are quite slim your car will be stolen. Still, the Common Sense Institute says that in 2022, the thieves stole more motor vehicles from Denver International Airport than any other single location in Colorado. Airport officials at DIA in July announced several measures to prevent theft, including beefing up its patrol in the airports by contracting with security personnel and the city\u2019s police department and adding 15 High Activity Location Observation (or HALO) security cameras to collect video footage of potential crimes. The airport also says it has technology to alert security should a stolen vehicle enter one of its parking lots. How to Prevent Your Car from Being Stolen at an Airport Parking Lot? To avoid having your car stolen, try to park in the premium lots that come with security monitoring, Musson suggests. You should also park in a lighted area, avoid keeping any valuables in your car, and, if you have GPS monitoring in your vehicle, make sure you set an alert so you know if your vehicle moves, he says. Steering wheel locks and car alarms can also be deterrents. Why Do People Steal Catalytic Converters? Stolen catalytic converters can fetch between $20 to $350 on the black market, but the replacement costs, should you have one stolen, a catalytic converter price averages more than $2,500, according to the National Automotive Dealers Association. But the reason people steal catalytic converters isn\u2019t to re-sell them, necessarily. About the size of a loaf of bread, catalytic converters are a critical emissions control device. Thieves are interested in catalytic converters because they contain precious metals like palladium and platinum, which can fetch high dollar amounts on the black market, explains Patryk Doornebos, who runs CarTriple.com , an automotive blog. Unfortunately, stealing a catalytic converter can be done in mere minutes, making it a lucrative and relatively low-risk activity for thieves, he says. Thieves can get under cars and steal catalytic converters quicklyl. getty \u201cAs for catalytic converter theft, vehicles with higher ground clearance, including trucks like the Ford F-150 or Chevrolet Silverado, are often targeted because of the easier access underneath,\u201d Doornebos says. \u201cHybrids like the Toyota Prius are also susceptible since their converters tend to have higher amounts of precious metals.\u201d A catalytic converter replacement can be a hassle because it can be tough to track down the part, especially in the event of a local crime spree when several other vehicle owners are making the same repairs.

I wore a boonie hat with a militia logo, Oakley mirrorshades, a shoulder-holster, and a miracle-fabric tactical T-shirt. I was every inch Lieutenant Colonel Wayne Osborne of the Delta Force. \u201cI won\u2019t do any bodyguard work out of town,\u201d I told the screen. \u201cIf I abandon my wife, she\u2019ll file for divorce.\u201d \u201cYour wife is your excuse for everything,\u201d said the Glovemaster. On my Zoom screen, he presented as the evil animated glove creature from the Beatles movie . IRL, the Glovemaster was a high-school hacker kid from Jersey born forty years after the Beatles broke up. I knew who he was because he still lived with his parents, who didn\u2019t know a damn thing about computer security. But the kid understood blockchain technology and he knew how to scam. And I needed his money. Not dollars\u2014never, ever, crappy government fiat money controlled by the banksters. I needed hard, proven, decentralized Internet money. This was my guarantee of financial freedom, so that someday I could keep all my promises to Jacqui. \u201cNever let your woman tie you down, bro,\u201d growled the Glovemaster. \u201cYou get your cold-wallet storage. Get your bugout bag. Get your handguns. Then you launch into action.\u201d He was telling me this from his parents\u2019 basement in Trenton. But the dude had made me rich once. It wasn\u2019t his fault that I\u2019d misplaced my cartoon ape. For Jacqui\u2019s sake I\u2019d convinced the crypto world that I was a heavily-armed J6 militia veteran. \u201cLieutenant Colonel Wayne Osborne\u201d was a two-fisted Afghan vet with five tours under his belt, an enforcer and kneecapper, the last man in the world you would ever want to cross. It had taken me three years of boning up on Second Amendment gun show talk and mall-ninja cyberwar jargon to build my tough-guy rep in crypto-land. But I was motivated. Because when a soldier finally comes home from overseas and sees the girl next door again\u2014well, you may not understand this, but I just had to have some of that. I just had to\u2014because that was who I was. And Jacqui was sweet about it. A decent church wedding, a house, and a baby, that was all she asked from me. I made my vows to her in the sight of God and man. Those were my core values. The rest\u2014that was just my necessary hustle in a troubled and treacherous world. I understood crypto. I knew plenty about air-gapping, public keys, block rewards, Know-Your-Customer rules, and all the good ways to ignore them. But still no white picket fence for my Jacqui. Not for any price an honest man could pay. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about your new client,\u201d said the big blue cartoon glove. \u201cHe\u2019s a Bitcoin one-percenter. He could buy a Trump Tower with his leftover Ethereum. If crypto is here to change the world, then the Mealybug is the change.\u201d \u201cSo, the Mealybug is your favorite whale now, eh?\u201d \u201cYes, he is. I\u2019m on the Mealybug\u2019s secret Discord. You know who turned me on to that? Pavel Marco himself!\u201d The Glovemaster always hacker-bragged about his connections\u2014but he could make it rain, too. \u201cAll right,\u201d I said, \u201cyour esteemed financial backer there, your oligarch with the yacht\u2014what\u2019s his problem?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s been doxxed.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d Better him than me, though. The real Lieutenant Colonel Wayne Osborne had been killed by a car-bomb in Iraq back in 2013. Not my name, not my rank, not my serial number. \u201cHis enemies found out who the Mealybug is, and where he is, and where he came from, and why he got that name. So he\u2019s got trolls and stalkers all over him now. He\u2019s on the run, he needs professional help. Lucky for him, I know a real operator\u2014you.\u201d I shrugged, and adjusted my holster. \u201cNothing new about a shakedown racket.\u201d \u201cEvery whale makes enemies,\u201d said the glove. \u201cThose no-coiners, they all hate success.\u201d \u201cSo, what kind of enemies does a Mealybug have? Russian spies, Jewish bankers? The Illuminati?\u201d \u201cCould be all three.\u201d \u201cIs he American? Maybe betrayed by some fed informant, feminazis, deep-staters, cultural Marxists?\u201d Ex-Delta Force Wayne Osborne always had a ready list of threat-actors. \u201cThat\u2019s for you to find out, Colonel. You\u2019re the ideal man for this job. How about a three-day weekend in Las Vegas?\u201d \u201cThen it\u2019s the Mob,\u201d I concluded. \u201cThe Cosa Nostra. Your Mealybug\u2019s a high-roller.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not saying what he is or what he isn\u2019t. I\u2019m saying he\u2019s my favorite whale. Do you live anywhere near the U.S. Mountain timezone?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not saying that I do or I don\u2019t. What does this job pay me?\u201d \u201cA true whale doesn\u2019t have to pay. I can tell you the exact date and time of his next big market move in Ethereum. When you surf in the wake of a big whale\u2014market up, market down, makes no difference. You\u2019ll make out like a bandit either way, and best of all, there\u2019s no paper trail.\u201d This hot tip was supposed to impress me, but I\u2019d been burned on Ethereum market moves so many times that I couldn\u2019t buy the dip\u2014I had no dip left. The Glovemaster sketched out the situation for me. In Vegas, the Mealybug was cowering in some penthouse. He was so scared that he never moved in the daylight. Only active after dark, terrified of paparazzi, stalkers, security cameras, bad guys who might curb-stomp him, put his feet in cement, dump him into what was left of Lake Meade. This yarn sounded like paranoid Howard Hughes bullshit, and it suddenly struck me that I didn\u2019t believe in the Mealybug. Sure, I believed in whales. I totally believed in Bitcoin. But when it came to a billionaire so scared he would throw Bitcoin at strangers, I just wasn\u2019t buying the pitch. Still, if I didn\u2019t believe in the Mealybug, I believed even less in his so-called \u201cenemies.\u201d \u201cShow me the color of his money.\u201d Jacqui and me, and the house . . . our story was epic. Epic failure. We\u2019d flown so high together, once. At market peak, I was ready to sign the dotted line for a 4500-square-foot house in a gated development. But I lost the down payment in a big Dogecoin dip. I stayed out of Dogecoin after that, no matter what Elon Musk said. No Tesla for me, either. Now Jacqui lived with me in a trailer park where I had to chain the hood on my pickup so the neighbors wouldn\u2019t steal my catalytic converter. Also, the pickup was iffy about running. I used a bike. The Mealybug\u2019s first payoff arrived in an Amazon Prime package at my favorite anonymous mail drop. The box was full of mush, half wax and half golden flakes, like cornflakes of precious metal gnawed off an asteroid. The coinage a hive of ants might use if ants were astronauts. I cycled over to Duke\u2019s Pawnshop, Duke being the guy in possession of some awesome techie gear I\u2019d bought when I was prosperous. I showed him a spoonful of the goo from the package. Duke used his x-ray fluorescence machine on it. It rated out at 22 Karat. I redeemed my favorite Internet-of-Things 5G router and took it back to the trailer. Jacqui caught me there with the rest of the loot, because there are no secrets in a trailer. She was wearing cut offs and a tank top and carrying a bag of canned goods. She saw my 5G router. \u201cI thought you sold that. How did you get it back?\u201d Then she saw the Prime package. \u201cYou\u2019re ordering from Amazon again! Did you get me something?\u201d I showed her the golden mush. She wrinkled her nose. \u201cWhat in the sacred name of Jesus?\u201d \u201cThis is gold, honey,\u201d I told her. \u201cI figure four ounces, which at today\u2019s spot price would be about two Ether.\u201d \u201cYou said Bitcoin was much sounder than Ether.\u201d \u201cIt is. This is just a retainer. I\u2019ve got to go to Vegas right away. To consult with a big-time coin guy.\u201d That brought a furrow to her brow. \u201cYou\u2019re going to cheat on me. You\u2019re going to Vegas so you can cheat on me.\u201d \u201cBaby, why do you say that? I want you to have everything you want, every single thing I promised! When you\u2019re happy, I\u2019m happy.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re totally in debt! We live in a tin box! What if we get sick? We have no health insurance.\u201d \u201cBaby, that\u2019s true, we\u2019re hard up now, but what if we hit it rich again? This is real gold! We struck gold, okay? It\u2019s not stupid government fiat that\u2019s owned by our deep-state oppressors. Even in the Bible, gold is wealth, and I can get us more, too.\u201d \u201cSure. You\u2019re gonna find gold in Las Vegas.\u201d Her scorn stung me. \u201cJacqui, precious, come with me! Why not? Let\u2019s go together. To Vegas! There are nice hotels, the food\u2019s great. It\u2019s a number one American holiday destination.\u201d She was still so darkly suspicious\u2014a terrible thing to see, because, before I\u2019d swept Jacqui off her feet, she\u2019d never looked like that. She wasn\u2019t even thirty and had worry lines in her face. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to come. To keep you out of girl-trouble.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Vegas! It\u2019s nice!\u201d I pulled her onto my lap. \u201cAlso, I can get you some cocaine.\u201d While Jacqui and I were on the plane to Vegas\u2014wearing some Democrat plague masks, a big drag\u2014I skimmed the basics about mealybugs on Google. It turned out that my client was named after a soft-bodied scale insect. A slow-moving arthropod, with weak legs, mostly covered with a white, waxy, cotton-like exudation. Mealybugs cling to the softest, wettest parts of plants, wedging themselves in leaf folds, stem crotches, or other tight locations. They suck juice out of the plant veins and distill it into a honeydew. In exchange for the golden dew, certain ants choose to protect the mealybug. The Mealybug was so rich he could afford to hire the likes of Pavel Marco, the toughest blackhat mercenary out of Mogadishu. But it seemed that old-school Pavel couldn\u2019t keep up with the latest developments in cyberwar. The Mealybug was nervous about his new horde of online enemies. So the Glovemaster had recommended me. I pinged a few satoshi into the Mealybug\u2019s Bitcoin account, so he\u2019d know that I was a player, and that I was around and alert. When we reached the Vegas hotel, I invented more noise to demonstrate my protective services. Government-approved \u201cprivate detectives\u201d and \u201cprivate security services\u201d\u2014they have their exams and licenses, and all that crap. That\u2019s gatekeeping meant to distract the sheeple from the power of peer-to-peer, decentralized, distributed knowledge. I didn\u2019t need a stinkin\u2019 badge. Crypto is a private banking system, and I was a private bank guard\u2014that was easy. Also\u2014and this was the best part\u2014I didn\u2019t have to really protect the Mealybug. The odds were ninety-nine out of a hundred that his enemies were all imaginary. My client was some gold-bug wedged into the top-floor of a Vegas casino, chewing on his own froth. How could anybody hurt him way up there? Vegas casinos are super-secure buildings. They\u2019re run by American mobsters who have seen every kind of crook on Planet Earth. I cooked up some fake TikTok video snippets of a bodyguard on patrol\u2014mean streets of Vegas, bulletproof vest, Heckler & Koch MP5. Open-source video clips. \u201cFake news\u201d to make me look good. In this case, lots of Vegas thriller stuff, like from . I\u2019d watched about a million thriller flicks while I was bored to death on duty as a telecommunications sergeant at an Army base in Kuwait. I leaked those videos in Twitter DMs. Not to boast about my hacker chops here, but whenever \u201cColonel Osborne\u201d looked on the prowl, hard and heavy-duty, people were plenty scared of him. To stay on my good side, the bros passed me lots of useful hints about the coin biz. Market positions running up and collapsing. Ground-floor recommendations about the next big thing in non-fungible tokens. I placed a few bets on the \u201cBathtub Babes\u201d NFT series. Then my own bathtub babe came out of our steamy bathroom wrapped in hotel-branded Turkish towels. She turned on the hotel TV, which had an erotic cable feed fit to make the Chinese, Russians, and Arabs eager to pick up Vegas showgirls. \u201cOh my goodness! None of this for you, bad boy! Let\u2019s go out and play.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t go out, babe. I have work to do.\u201d \u201cWell then, until you\u2019re done, I\u2019ll check out my Opensea wallet. Let\u2019s see how my art is doing.\u201d She put her Macbook on the hotel table, opposite from my PC. Jacqui liked to buy art in the big NFT gallery markets, where she always lost money. She only bought art that was pretty, as opposed to the genuinely profitable NFT artworks, which were ugly squiggles, or crude 8-bit cartoons, or mutant monkeys. Still, her can-do attitude was so endearing, especially after all we\u2019d been through. I worried. We were in Vegas, which felt good, but soon we\u2019d be stuck back in our trailer, and then what? To Jacqui, I was never Lieutenant Colonel Wayne Osborne of the Delta Force. I was her husband, the big kid next door, Mike Luftschager. Back to that poorhouse, back to scowls and scoldings. I couldn\u2019t let Wayne Osborne lose her. I left the screen, rummaged in my suitcase until I found the Altoids box, popped it open, and scooped a good helping of coke onto the suite\u2019s glass-topped coffee table. I opened the deck of Aviators that came with the room and used the ace of spades to draw the coke into lines, rolled up a twenty, and held it out to her. \u201cYou first, sweetie.\u201d She stood there for a moment, then relented. \u201cYou do still love me, don\u2019t you.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s live a little, for once. We deserve it. Why can\u2019t we be happy, have fun? Let\u2019s go have fun.\u201d She snorted a line. Her eyes brightened. \u201cNow you.\u201d There was an edge to her voice, and I didn\u2019t need to push that. I did a line. Suddenly I felt a change of attitude. Sure, the odds were steep, but hadn\u2019t I worked hard for success? If I got a lucky break, why fret about that, and fear the worst like some loser? Were rich crypto speculators cowards? Just the Mealybug, it seemed. Jacqui went downstairs with me and we hit the slots. We didn\u2019t lose all that much, and thanks to the coke we forgot to eat. While she lay on the hotel bed, drowsily flipping through celebrity Instagrams, I managed my website for Colonel Osborne\u2014\u201cBlack Diamond Security.\u201d I\u2019d modeled my site on the website for Pavel Marco, spooky and enigmatic, because tough minded men-of-action with international connections played it close to the vest. Everything token-gated. Jacqui had passed out, phone in hand, but Vegas was still alive and rollicking, because, night-time in Vegas. Due to the coke, I felt a restless urge to \u201ccase the joint\u201d over at the Mealybug\u2019s tower hotel. I put on a cheap straw hat and a plague mask, because Vegas has a shitload of smart security cams. I gazed up at the glowing purple walls of the almighty Imperial Palace, where the Mealybug had a suite paid for by \u201cHemiptera Hemimetabolous,\u201d some Greek millionaire. Down on the street were clusters of Midwest tourist hicks looking much dumber and drunker than me. I decided to try the lobby. Crossing the street, I was almost run down by a Volkswagen Beetle. I hopped from the dusty gutter as it sped past my bootheels. Silently. No Volkswagen engine noise. Then another Beetle, red, one of those humpy old-fashioned shapes favored by Adolf Hitler, sliding along blind and silent, only this one was circling the Imperial Palace in the opposite direction. Thirty seconds later, two more\u2014big red bugs meeting quiet as spiders at a Vegas traffic light, then turning opposite directions. Another beetle waited under the hotel portico, discreet, lurking. Nothing human got in or out of it. The hotel valets, who should have been all over it, ignored it. I sidled over, bent down, and cupped my hands against the dark window. No driver in there\u2014not even a steering wheel. \u201cMay I help you, sir?\u201d said a valet, and if I was a big bruiser, he was bigger. \u201cOne of these robot cars almost hit me.\u201d \u201cSelf-driving units, sir, over from the Tesla Factory in Reno. Experimental models. Sometimes eight, sometimes ten. Maybe more. I\u2019d watch my step, sir.\u201d I made myself scarce, then pulled my Android burner phone. No location tracking. I called the Imperial Palace operator, got a polite and too-talkative chatbot. The talking bot had never heard of any Imperial guest called Hemimetabolous\u2014it just blandly denied reality. I sent the Glovemaster an URGENT!!! text message. While I waited I cased the hotel\u2019s garbage bins\u2014an old hacker trick, especially good for buildings where they beat you up if you try to sneak in. Under the long rubber lid, I found lots of throwaway casino-kitchen garbage, some thick waxy froth, and some long empty husks. The Glovemaster called me up at the number I had just sent. \u201cColonel, I said I would get you a job in Vegas. I didn\u2019t say you could drag me into some mafia scene. The Mealybug\u2019s hotel has to be mobbed up. Why do you want to get past their security?\u201d \u201cGlovemaster, do you want your whale alive, or do you want him rendered for blubber? I\u2019m on patrol outside his hotel right now. There are freakin\u2019 car-bombs rolling around down here. Iraq-style Improvised Explosive Devices. There\u2019s enough firepower down here to blow your Mealybug to smithereens and burn every living thing in this building.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re on the level?\u201d \u201cSure as my name is Wayne Osborne.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t wanna do this,\u201d mourned Glovemaster, \u201cbut I guess I\u2019d better.\u201d At three-fifteen AM a black chopper lofted from the top of the Imperial Palace. The high-rollers appreciate a helipad. Arab Princes. Deep State guys. Members of the Trump clan. I\u2019d done my good deed for the day. Maybe the best deed of my career, if the rich whale was feeling generous. Back to our hotel. People go to Vegas to get divorced, but Jacqui was out of her divorcing mood. My nerves were shot from pulling a freak-out late-nighter, but while I stayed in bed, she rose bright and chipper and went out to \u201cdo Vegas.\u201d When she returned I was showered and having a room-service breakfast\u2014darn good breakfast too, a stack of Belgian waffles, two scrambled eggs, and a generous rasher of applewood-smoked bacon, all of that chow for under twenty bucks US fiat. \u201cI love Vegas, Mike,\u201d she said, dropping laden shopping bags. \u201cRemember, sweetie\u2014call me Wayne when I\u2019m working.\u201d \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re working.\u201d I decided it was better if I didn\u2019t respond to that. \u201cMaybe we could start over right here,\u201d Jacqui said, \u201cand never go back to that cheesebox in Boulder.\u201d \u201cA lot of people start over in Vegas. It\u2019s an adventure.\u201d She flopped down on the bed and leaned her head on her hand. \u201cPeople are so friendly here. I met such a nice old lady, she says I could be an exotic dancer. She used to be an exotic dancer, before she did casino security. Maybe I could be an exotic dancer, too, make a lot of money, help pay for things. She says I have the looks for it.\u201d Jacqui wasn\u2019t the Vegas showgirl type, because she looked girl-next-door, but if she was talking about the fun she\u2019d had, then I didn\u2019t have to talk about what Wayne Osborne had been doing all night. Because I wasn\u2019t gonna mention that, and that was gonna look suspicious. \u201cWhat happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,\u201d I said. Jacqui laughed at that, the way she used to laugh. Then I felt so much better that I thought, maybe she\u2019s right. Maybe Vegas life is the right life for us. I don\u2019t have to be Wayne Osborne. I could get a quiet casino security job and spend all night watching a bank of video monitors, just like I\u2019d spent years in uniform hunched over screens in Kuwait. Then I thought, I\u2019ll get fat and old that way, and my heart will break, and I\u2019ll die. We flew back to the trailer park, Jacqui beefing every step of the way. \u201cI know Vegas is an ungodly town,\u201d she said. \u201cI know it\u2019s full of hookers and drugs and gambling. But they know they\u2019re a sin town and they know why they\u2019re sinning. That\u2019s why they\u2019re more honest in Vegas than all these other towns in America.\u201d Also, we had run out of cocaine. I had to do a post-assignment debriefing with Glovemaster, who was even more fretful than Jacqui. \u201cI thought the Mealybug was just nervous,\u201d said the blue glove on the laptop screen. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that he had real exterminators. In Vegas, they\u2019re fumigating the Imperial Hotel.\u201d \u201cYeah, I saw that on the news there. They say it\u2019s bedbugs. Big local scandal.\u201d \u201cHow much trouble is he in, the Mealybug?\u201d \u201cPlenty of trouble, but it\u2019s cool. I rescued him. His enemies have no idea who I am.\u201d \u201cThey know who am! They know I sprung the Mealybug from that trap in Vegas. They know that I know where the Mealybug has gone.\u201d \u201cThey doxxed your whale\u2014are they doxxing you, too, Glovemaster? Is this video call secure?\u201d \u201cHow should I know? Find out who they are and get rid of them, Colonel! Get them off my back.\u201d \u201cI might do that, if the money\u2019s right. Where is the Mealybug?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s in Miami,\u201d the Glovemaster muttered. \u201cYou should go there right away.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, because I needed the money, but maybe I shouldn\u2019t have done that. Maybe I should have talked the Glovemaster out of his loyalty to the Mealybug. A lot of coinbros will worship some cryptocoin whale, but that devotion never goes both ways. When the followers become useless, they can come to harm. After surviving fear and loathing in Las Vegas, I knew that Miami was likely to be worse\u2014but then came some Amazon boxes. Bigger boxes, arriving at my dead drop. This time, it looked like some human being had meddled with the golden flakes. They\u2019d smelted them into coin-like slugs, some kind of manufacturing value-add. Down at the pawnshop, Duke had a good look through his jeweler\u2019s loupe. \u201cI knew a Jewish guy once who showed me these. Souvenirs from a raid on Islamic terrorists. This is smuggler\u2019s gold. Out of the \u2018hawala\u2019 scene, like from Sudan, Bombay, Dubai.\u201d \u201cCan you melt it down for me, so it looks like normal gold?\u201d \u201cAre you crazy? American gold bugs go nuts for this! This is gold that is off the grid. Shit-hits-the-fan gold. Total-world-armageddon gold.\u201d I\u2019d never seen Duke so goldbuggy, so I swapped him four of the creepy nuggets and redeemed everything I\u2019d ever pawned to him. I took the remainder in fiat cash. Some bills turned out to be counterfeit, but that wasn\u2019t Duke\u2019s fault, because fiat is bullshit. There was no room in our trailer for all the cool stuff we\u2019d bought during the brief Dogecoin peak. With all our brutal bad luck since then, I\u2019d forgotten those weeks when we were almost millionaires. I\u2019d pawned my electronics mostly, like my Dogecoin mining rigs, but also all of Jacqui\u2019s kitchen appliances. Now we could barely move\u2014we had to sidle sideways through our high-stacked house goods\u2014but she was happy enough to weep tears of joy. \u201cGosh, Vegas was such a luck-charm for us! We should fly back there right away!\u201d \u201cI have to go to Miami. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t grow on trees, babe. They have to mine it.\u201d \u201cCan I come, too? Green candles! Line goes up!\u201d She was so cute when she spoke coinbro. At Miami Airport all the taxi drivers tried to chisel us, but I was hip to their penny-ante hustle and I rented a Jeep Wrangler. I even paid for it with Bitcoin, first time I\u2019d ever been able to do that, and it was an account that Glovemaster had stolen and lent to me, which made it even sweeter. Once we were lodged in our classy Miami Beach hotel\u2014a honeymoon hotel, because I was out of Jacqui\u2019s doghouse and I wanted to stay that way\u2014I flipped open the laptop. In poured a new heap of encrypted Protonmail from Glovemaster, who\u2019d been getting steadily more agitated during the time it took us to get to Florida. Tourists always look like fishbait in Miami, so I told Jacqui to doll up so she could pass for a good-looking local. I wouldn\u2019t claim that Miami women have their own dress code, but they sure as hell don\u2019t dress like normal girls. Also, Floridians never mess around with masks or social distancing, so Jacqui could socialize all she wanted. Jacqui was outgoing, she was a charmer, she was good at weddings, church services, and Republican Party meetings. As for me, back to the hard work. You know: \u201cI wish I had a bass boat and a Z-28/but I guess that stuff\u2019ll have to wait\u201d which was from our song, me and Jacqui\u2019s. My lifetime favorite, \u201cMoney in the Bank\u201d from the 1993 album by the great John Anderson, a true American songwriter-poet. John Anderson never tells lies about life. Not to interrupt my story here, but that good ole boy is the real deal. I hummed this anthem as I paged through Glovemaster\u2019s freaked-out emails. Sure enough, my too-daring teen boy had stirred up a wasp\u2019s nest. He had always loved to rob the hick fundies and the QAnon types\u2014easy marks for a high-SAT high schooler\u2014but the American capital of electronic crime is not Trenton, New Jersey. It\u2019s Boca Raton, Florida. Not a lot of people know that Boca is a buzzing colony of multi-generational crime families, scamming people worldwide with fake emails and phone calls. Those American confidence racketeers, some of them date way back to the 1920s. There\u2019s even an old black-and-white Marx Brothers movie , where everybody is ripping off everybody else for fake real-estate\u2014that would totally be them in Boca, except much, much less funny. Glovemaster, gloved hand in hand with the high-rolling Mealybug, had got himself on the wrong side of these chicken-fried con men. Just blundered into the stinging midst of them, somehow, like a drunk kid party-crashing a Florida swamp full of mosquitos. They were counter attacking him with multiple fraud schemes\u2014posing as the FBI (a particular con-man favorite), as IRS agents eager to audit him, as Russian intelligence. Sometimes with death threats, sometimes as alluring girls in trouble pleading for his help . . . Glovemaster was getting a whirlwind of too-clever bullshit in his Twitter direct messages, in his Discord chats, all over. They were stalking him and they were gonna skin him, too, but they wanted to skin the Mealybug much, much more. Because the Mealybug was fatter, slower, and tastier. I paged through these fantastic threats\u2014it amazed me that hundreds of wildly different spam ambush messages could be written by maybe just five dudes in Boca. More than boiler-room con-men, they were creative writers. One particularly freaky message stopped me cold. . . . . . . . I\u2019d never seen any online pitch this weird, and I\u2019d seen plenty. Then I realized this must be written by some GPT-4 offshoot, except whatever they had primed this AI with, it wasn\u2019t English. I contacted Glovemaster directly. He didn\u2019t give a damn about Artificial Intelligences writing weird spam. \u201cAre you in Miami with the Mealybug?\u201d \u201cYeah. I\u2019m gonna arrange a personal meeting.\u201d \u201cLook, Colonel, I got you this job because a guy with five tours in Afghanistan is never gonna back down. But every friend that the Mealybug had\u2014we\u2019re all scattering. The Mealybug had three-hundred-K followers on Twitter alone, but they\u2019re going dark. They\u2019re pretending they never had anything to do with him. Me too, Colonel. I\u2019m outta here. I gotta book a flight. In another name. Thank God you sold me those fake passports.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t overdo it with those,\u201d I told him, because forged US passports from Pakistan might pass muster in Pakistan, but nowhere else\u2014except maybe with teenagers in New Jersey. \u201cI can\u2019t let them get me. I\u2019m thinking Dubai.\u201d \u201cDubai makes sense. Good place to start over, I hear.\u201d \u201cI just dunno who to trust right now,\u201d said the Glovemaster, trusting me, \u201cbut the good thing is, we can still trust in cryptographic mathematics, right? We can rely on the internet and the blockchain and computational power. Blockchain works anywhere in the world.\u201d \u201cBlockchain really exists. The source code is visible and transparent.\u201d \u201cThe whole world will be completely transformed by blockchain,\u201d the Glovemaster pleaded. \u201cI\u2019m totally with that program,\u201d I said. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, the old world is already gone.\u201d \u201c\u2018We\u2019re All Gonna Make It.\u2019 We just need to stay on the good side of a few special people. To respect their ideological commitment to self-sovereign identity.\u201d \u201cOh yeah,\u201d I said. \u201cCall me Mister Diamond Hands.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to the Moon,\u201d he told me. Then the Glovemaster folded his blue gloved fingers and I never heard from him again. Not a gesture. Not a whisper. Not a funeral for him, even. Jacqui came back with her shopping bags, a little tipsy, but in a good way. \u201cWow, Miami is so terrific! I wanna live here! You won\u2019t believe the classy women I\u2019ve met!\u201d \u201cIt was good fun, huh?\u201d I\u2019d been hitting a hip-flask of Venezuelan rum to deal with the bad vibes from the Glovemaster\u2019s paranoia. \u201cThey\u2019re a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Just like grandma\u2019s quilting bee\u2014all the girls are nice, everybody\u2019s an equal, everybody gets to chat as much they like. And, the way we all get rich together is to boost the floor price of Wicked WASP ProFile Pics! They\u2019re NFT art, like, cool token cartoons of really mean White Anglo-Saxon chicks. Miami chicks think they\u2019re hilarious. Especially when they really are WASP chicks in Miami. \u2018Cause there are lots of them here.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that you\u2019re a WASP yourself, Jacqui.\u201d \u201cWow, that makes it even more perfect! Do you think half an eth was too much for my new ProFile Pic?\u201d That stopped me. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you still had any ether.\u201d \u201cI used the coin you gave me for our wedding.\u201d So I had left the wife alone for maybe five hours, and she plunged into a Florida sorority with an entrance fee of about two grand in fiat. Her wedding dowry was supposed to be our last-ditch bug-out money if the IRS ever came to shoot us. I felt like grabbing her by her suntanned neck and tossing her off our eighth-floor Miami balcony with its beach view. But that was the Venezuelan rum doing my thinking for me. I should know better than have anything to do with Venezuela, that stinking socialist sump. I was in Miami, the capital of Bitcoin, chasing the payoff that would save us. A husband protects his wife. He doesn\u2019t blow a major business deal just because she\u2019s acting like a woman. To keep my wits sharp, I did some of the coke that Jacqui broke out. Miami was crammed with Colombian marching-powder, so of course she\u2019d copped some from a new girlfriend. Also, in Miami the coke was great. I was rubbing my gums when my cell phone doinged with a text: Hemimetabolous will meet with you. Be at the fountain at the foot of Sixteenth Street and Collins. A limo will be there in thirty minutes. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Jacqui asked. \u201cI\u2019ve got to work. It\u2019s business.\u201d She blinked. \u201cA couple of the WASP girls invited me to a Historic Homes of Miami Tour. I might go out with them.\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d Sixteenth Street was only four blocks from our hotel. I strolled down Collins in the early evening. As I walked, I calculated the angles on my client and sponsor, Mr. Mealybug Hemimetabolous. I\u2019d been researching him online. Everybody thinks they\u2019re anonymous on the blockchain. They\u2019re only as anonymous as \u201c34xp4vRoCGJym3xR7yCVPFHo\u201d is anonymous. Especially those early guys, the Crypto OGs, they were wild and careless. And Mr. Mealybug, he\u2019d been an Ethereum founder, from that very first Initial Coin Offering. He was a crypto world-beater, the Mealybug. His blockchain programs in Ethereum did not look like anybody else\u2019s. Solidity, Dart, Delphi, Go, Java, Python, Ruby, Rust\u2014he never used any Ethereum-supported languages. Instead, his programs looked like raw machine-language gibberish that were just somehow\u2014 , with Ethereum dapps like a sharp beak plunged into a vein. With the coke to boost me, I lurked by the fountain on 16th, feeling a little paranoid but, mostly, sharp-witted and aggressive. I had it figured that the Mealybug was not a coinbro at all. Never a real fintech guy. Those guys build the blockchain systems and then buy and hold on. They don\u2019t write back-doors that can puncture a blockchain and silently drain its resources. It smelled like covert cyberwar. Especially the \u201cNorks,\u201d because the North Koreans have perpetrated sixty percent of all the heists in crypto history. So then, what was his life story, the mysterious Mr. Hemimatabolous? Why is he scurrying from Vegas to Miami? Why hire Lieutenant Colonel Wayne Osborne of Black Diamond Security to protect him? Why not just go to his spymasters in North Korea, the ones who gave him the super-weird zero-day backdoor software? Because he\u2019s a double-crossing rip-off artist, that\u2019s why. He\u2019s not loyal to North Korea. He\u2019s a cyberwar operator on the run. Also, he\u2019s losing his friends right and left, because the North Koreans are vindictive bastards. When they send you death threats they\u2019re not real great at English. They sound like Commies from Mars. I was working this new theory about the Mealybug when the limo showed up, an enormous black Mercedes SUV. I heard the back door unlatch and I climbed inside. No one was driving. The car crossed over South Beach to the mainland and drove near Camp Biscayne. The tall buildings drifted away and the landscape got tropical. So, why Vegas? Because Vegas was discreet and he was hiding there, but he got found out. Why Miami? Because Miami is a wide-open gateway to the Caribbean and Central America. His pursuers are at his heels. He\u2019s searching the planet for fresh nooks and crannies. The limo slowed and pulled up to the gate of a historically-protected property from the first Miami real-estate boom. A handsome compound with tall palms behind high pink stucco walls with broken glass on top. Brass plaques at the gate with the names of offshored shell companies. I was afraid of that mansion\u2014but also, I wanted to own it. Quiet billionaire property. Servants and attendants. You could send goons to attack the U.S. Senate from a place like that and nobody would dare to arrest you. \u201cPersonal self-sovereignty.\u201d \u201cPrivate Protection Service Strategies.\u201d I was hustling a double-crossing billionaire who was terrified of the North Koreans. But I\u2019d already saved his life once. \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy, be greedy when others are fearful\u201d\u2014that\u2019s what Warren Buffett says. The Mealybug was fearful. Maybe I could be the greedy winner, for once. One fast smash-and-grab raid, in Caribbean pirate-style. \u201cLieutenant Colonel Wayne Osborne of the Delta Force\u201d grabs the keys to the gold-bug castle. Wayne Osborne shuts down his websites and email, he \u201cpulls the rug,\u201d and there\u2019s nobody there anymore. Then me and Jacqui are Mr. and Mrs. Michael J. Luftschager. Not just a happy couple with the white picket fence, we\u2019re oligarchs in a palace. Our kids are born rich. The silent gates swung open. The car rolled toward a 1920s era mansion, pastel stucco with mullioned windows. By modern mega-mansion standards, it was cute and little-girlish even, like the lair of a silent-film actress. Madame had spent decades grooming her date palms, orchids, croquet ground, fountains, koi pond, magnolias, and mangoes. A lovely old garden, but all of these plants looked kinda peaked, like they were somehow drained. I rang the doorbell, one of those video-equipped smart-house security units. The front door opened, revealing an empty foyer. Two guard dogs loped up from the depths of the house. Silent, well-trained dogs, the kind that can rip the arteries out of your legs. Warily I followed the silent dogs to an interior parlor, a rich-girl\u2019s dainty piano room re-wired as a monitored guard shack. There sat the Mealybug\u2019s bodyguard and factotum. None other than the infamous Pavel Marco. Although he looked wrinkled and sick, I recognized him. I had met him once, at an embassy affair in Kuwait, and he\u2019d made a huge impression on me. When I\u2019d first come to admire him, he was a swaggering Global War on Terror buccaneer. An elite for-hire Blackwater Secret Squirrel type, more suave than any Bond villain, an olive-skinned millionaire hustler with thick silver hair swept back from his forehead, bespoke suit and tie, creased trousers, Italian shoes. Not American\u2014Americans weren\u2019t cool enough. A Greek Cypriot, because in the Middle East the Cypriots were plausibly deniable by everybody. \u201cAren\u2019t you Dr. Pavel Marco?\u201d I asked. He looked a little surprised. \u201cI haven\u2019t used that name in quite a while.\u201d \u201cI met you when you worked for the Saudis in Kuwait City. You wouldn\u2019t remember me\u2014I was just a bean-sprout back then.\u201d \u201cAnd you are?\u201d \u201cLieutenant Colonel Wayne Osborne, Delta Force.\u201d \u201cI do remember you. You were at Fallujah.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right. \u2018Vigilant Resolve,\u2019 2004.\u201d \u201cYou look quite different now.\u201d \u201cI got a desk job. Civilian life. Crypto finance tech.\u201d \u201cVery well. The Mealybug has hired you, so I have to direct you. This is our strategic situation. They know about this house, because they doxxed it. They know about the yacht, they doxxed that too. Also they know about the Progeny in the gardens. Because of the Progeny, they will attack, so we have to conduct the Mealybug from the house to the yacht.\u201d \u201cProgeny?\u201d \u201cThe larvae. We may lose some of them. There are more in the yacht.\u201d \u201cLarvae?\u201d \u201cThe offspring. The larvae in Vegas were poisoned after we fled the beetles.\u201d \u201cYou mean the cars.\u201d \u201cI mean the predatory insects from another world. When we move her, we can\u2019t let her be seen.\u201d ? \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cBecause she\u2019s an insect,\u201d he said, exasperated, as if I were a three-year old. \u201cWait. The Mealybug is a ?\u201d Pavel Marco studied me. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know,\u201d he said, wondering. \u201cExactly how ignorant are you?\u201d \u201cI knew enough to identify those car bombs in Vegas.\u201d Marco\u2019s spotted hands trembled, from palsy, or anger, or both. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem as bright as most computer hackers, soldier. But given this crisis, I guess you\u2019ll have to do.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m here to help. The Mealybug, how big is it? Maybe we can move it in one of your Doberman\u2019s cages.\u201d \u201c\u2018Her,\u2019 not \u2018it!\u2019\u201d Marco snapped. \u201cThe Mealybug is a precious creature, a princess from another planet! You can\u2019t just ship her like a bale of hundred-dollar bills.\u201d \u201cYeah. Right, sorry.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be misled by the Internet propaganda! This extraterrestrial coalition trying to exterminate her\u2014once they\u2019ve killed her, do you think they\u2019ll leave our planet? Never! They are the occupation forces! Destroying our freedom, regulating everything, forcing us to conform to senseless rules of conduct made far away . . . they\u2019ll enslave us! Just because we were hospitable to her\u2014just because she was our precious, honored guest!\u201d Was this dementia? \u201cI\u2019ve never met the Mealybug. Can I? Now? I mean, if you please?\u201d Marco stood, gripping the arm of the padded office chair. At that embassy years ago, among a crowd of Arab Princes, French diplomats, Kurds, Syrians, Iranian Shi\u2019ites\u2014everybody making the War on Terror impossible to win\u2014he\u2019d been a chic, self-possessed operator, a ladies\u2019 man with two Lebanese belly-dancers smoking kif in the back of his Rolls-Royce. Now, as we tottered toward a back room, he grumbled about his Gulf War Syndrome. He had every symptom and then some: chronic fatigue, memory loss, diarrhea, palsy, blinding headaches, debilitating muscle pains. To sit still, stare at screens, and push buttons, that was all that was left to him. We ventured into madame\u2019s pink-tinted boudoir\u2014with the two big guard-dogs sniffing along. And there she was. The Dobermans seemed to adore the Mealybug, or at least they admired what she was eating, from a big ceramic trough. A kind of flower-planter, loaded with five-star hotel fruit plates dumped under her beak like ten Carmen Miranda headdresses: pineapple chunks, kiwi, sliced coconut, canistel, chocolate persimmon, jackfruit, mamey, sapote, tiny little purple plantains, all of this bounty fermenting in the trough with a minor cloud of fruit flies. She didn\u2019t mind the fruit flies, being akin to them. She was lozenge-shaped, flower-like, with waxy, pink-tinted petals all over her. Her mouth slurped steadily, like a teen-girl over a too-thick milkshake, and she had round lidless shoe-button eyes, six of them, coyly hidden under wax flakes like bangs. She was warm-blooded. Hotter than human blood-heat, even, hot and smelly\u2014a good smell, like fresh-baked bread. Not as big as a human woman, but good-sized, bigger than the Dobermans. I got the impression that her six limbs, which were demurely folded under her, were not like bugs\u2019 arms, they were like girls\u2019 arms, sleek and tender-skinned, with bones inside, and nicely-kept embroidery-needle fingers. I felt absolutely no sense of repulsion. I felt awe. \u201cHow long have you been with her?\u201d I asked Pavel. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the first to protect her, but I was the first to survive. We got wind of those meteors out of the desert\u2014chunks of raw gold falling out the sky in the Rub\u2019 al Khali.\u201d He lifted his doddering head. \u201cI had lost the War on Terror. But with her, I couldn\u2019t lose. Always the winner, with her. And never two days alike, with her! Every day an adventure! She\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d A big beautiful many-limbed bug slurping up rotting fruit at a trough. If you\u2019d told me that I\u2019d buy that, I would have laughed at you. But that\u2019s not how I felt. Just being near her gave me a sense of peace, like all the striving I had been doing, my whole life, was wasted energy. That was over now. I didn\u2019t have to be smart all the time just to survive. \u201cYou feel it too, don\u2019t you,\u201d Pavel said. \u201cShe plays the crypto game better than any human, enough to pile a stack of imaginary coins up to the stars. But who needs money when you have her?\u201d \u201cAnd they\u2019re coming to kill her,\u201d I said. \u201cWe can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d A door chime sounded. Pavel pulled a Beretta M9 sidearm, looked reluctantly at the powerful, elegant weapon in his palsied hand, and put the gun back in his armpit. I left him with the Mealybug and hurried to the security screen room. Outside the mansion\u2019s front door stood three elegant, well-to-do white women. A blonde, a redhead\u2014and Jacqui. \u201cHello in there?\u201d Jacqui said, leaning to the speaker so her face loomed in the camera. \u201cWe\u2019re here for the Historic Homes of Miami Tour? Your gate was open. May we come in?\u201d I couldn\u2019t find the speaker button to reply to her. This didn\u2019t seem to bother Jacqui\u2019s WASP friends. They ignored the locked house, plucked up some fallen Florida palmetto leaves\u2014like canoe paddles, with teeth on both sides\u2014and commenced to thrash the garden foliage. There were cocoons in the trees. The Mealybug\u2019s children, stuck in tropical bushes like Mexican pinatas. Pavel Marco appeared behind me. \u201cThis is it,\u201d he said, \u201cthe assault.\u201d He pulled open a drawer and got out a Mercedes key fob. \u201cGet the SUV out of the garage. I\u2019ll get the Mealybug.\u201d I hesitated. I couldn\u2019t leave Jacqui out there. Instead of finding the garage I went out to rescue her. I caught up to her as she stood staring at her women friends. Except they weren\u2019t women anymore. The women\u2014the wasp-things\u2014were grabbing the shattered larvae. Their jaws unhinged and they went mad with frenzied glee, devouring the Mealybug\u2019s babies. The pulp of the larvae dripped from their maws to their cute frocks. \u201cWhoa!\u201d Jacqui said. \u201cThose are Lily Pulitzer dress sets! We just bought those!\u201d \u201cWe need to leave. Right now.\u201d \u201cWhat happened to my friends?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re not your friends. They\u2019re extraterrestrial exterminators.\u201d \u201cWhat are they eating?\u201d \u201cThe Mealybug\u2019s babies.\u201d \u201cWow! That\u2019s so creepy! Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d \u201cI have to save the Mealybug,\u201d I said, clutching the key fob. \u201cThere\u2019s a car in the garage. I need to get it.\u201d \u201cGimme that,\u201d Jacqui said, grabbing the fob from my hand. \u201cI\u2019ll get the car. You get the Mealybug.\u201d She seemed energized in a way I had not seen before. More WASP women arrived at the gate. I dashed back into the house. In the boudoir, Pavel was communing with the Mealybug, who held his shriveled hands with two of her six arms, her gray eyes shining. \u201cWe must reach the yacht,\u201d Pavel said. \u201cI used to be able to lift her.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all right. From now on I\u2019ll do it.\u201d The Mealybug turned her alien face toward a nearby desktop screen. Text appeared on it. \u201cWill there be food?\u201d the screen recited aloud. The synthesized voice was a startling contralto. \u201cMuch food aboard the yacht, your highness,\u201d Pavel promised. She emitted a spiracled moan, hopped off her pedestal, and moved toward me. I got my arms below her and lifted her off the floor. She weighed about as much as a large poodle. She wrapped her top forelimbs around my neck. My cheek brushed the carapace of waxy exudate that covered her back. She smelled like heaven. She folded up her other limbs and settled into my arms, her multi-eyed head resting on my shoulder. I didn\u2019t waste time: out of the room, down the hall, out the front door. Jacqui was there behind the wheel of the Mercedes, motor running. \u201cThe hatch!\u201d I called. The hatchback opened. I gently laid the Mealybug into a little throne back there, a specialized socket tailor-made just for her, where she could watch over the back seat and tell the driver what to do. Pavel made a brave effort to man the front passenger seat, with his gun in hand, but he was crippled with pain and weariness. I had to shove him into the back seat like a collapsing bag of groceries. As I came around the side the wasp women staggered forward, bloated with prey, questing fingernails grown to hollow black stingers. I climbed in and slammed the door; the wasps scraped and scratched at the car\u2019s glossy finish. Jacqui floored it, the wheels spat gravel, and the wasp women went airborne. Out on the boulevard we swerved into the night traffic. \u201cTo the marina,\u201d gasped Pavel. \u201cIsland Gardens. Quickly.\u201d \u201cPavel, this is my wife Jacqui,\u201d I said. I got out my GPS. \u201cHere\u2014follow this.\u201d The Mealybug\u2019s contralto voice came from the dashboard sound system. \u201cMind the speed limit.\u201d At the Island Gardens Marina, six chic Bahama supercruisers shone under cool vapor-lighting, multipurpose vehicles for the multinational Miami elite. Suppose you\u2019re rich, you\u2019ve got enemies. Well, you climb aboard one of those floating mansions and next day you\u2019re over the blue horizon, surrounded by your paid staff, no warrants at the door, no cops, no snoops, no North Koreans, no Boca Raton scammer mafia\u2014just the protectors on your payroll, and your precious self. The Mealybug\u2019s gleaming white sixty-meter yacht was staffed 24/7, with a well-trained international crew of discreet Filipinos and Indians. We got the princess on board and into her owner\u2019s suite. Pavel Marco spoke with the captain about our destination: El Salvador. The mate led me and Jacqui to a private cabin. Satin pillows on the bed, a sofa and big TV, polished wooden highlights, a wide window with a view of the lights of the nighttime marina and the dark ocean beyond. \u201cBetter than any house, eh?\u201d I said. \u201cAs soon as we cast off, we\u2019re safe. Out in international waters, we\u2019re finally self-sovereign.\u201d Jacqui did not sit. \u201cI\u2019m not going, Mike.\u201d \u201cWhat? Why not?\u201d \u201cWell, because I\u2019m an American. I\u2019ve never been out of the country. I don\u2019t even have a passport.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t have mine either. There are work-arounds for that.\u201d She looked at me, her eyes large. \u201cEver since Vegas I\u2019ve been thinking. Mike, you try too hard. Since the day we got married, you\u2019ve been trying too hard. All this Colonel Wayne Osborne stuff. Because of me. I spend money and I look good and that\u2019s about it.\u201d \u201cI love you like that!\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t love me when I told you I spent our IRS safe money. We\u2019re not happy. I spend as much time trying to be the girl next door for you as you do trying to be a tough guy. We don\u2019t do anything together except for drugs, TV, or sex. It\u2019s going nowhere.\u201d \u201cBut look where we are right now! Look at this place! We\u2019re hooked up with a billionaire, a one percenter, the biggest crypto whale you\u2019ve ever seen\u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014who\u2019s a bug from outer space.\u201d \u201cNobody has to know that.\u201d \u201cBigger bugs are trying to eat him.\u201d \u201cHer.\u201d \u201cHer, okay.\u201d \u201cYou just need to see her, spend some time with her.\u201d \u201cLike this Pavel guy? He can\u2019t even see me. He\u2019s falling apart.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s his Gulf War Syndrome. I knew him back in Kuwait.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got better ideas, Mike. I met this classy older lady, Vanessa, through the WASP club. She knows powerful people, and she likes me!\u201d \u201cIs she another insect?\u201d \u201cNot this one. She\u2019s very religious.\u201d I hadn\u2019t been in a church since our wedding day, but Jacqui liked church and had lots of connections there. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Jacqui soothed me. \u201cI\u2019ll keep the secret about your Mealybug. I know your crypto secrets are important to you. You deserve to be together for as long as you can.\u201d \u201cBut what will you do, baby?\u201d She smiled her best girl-next-door smile. \u201cMe? I\u2019m gonna become an influencer. I\u2019m halfway there already, actually. I influenced the shit out of you.\u201d That\u2019s how I lost Jacqui. I\u2019d lost my computer, too, back at the Miami hotel room, security-locked and encrypted. I borrowed a no-name PC from one of the yacht crew and, since I wasn\u2019t a newbie idiot, I pulled a 128-gigabyte USB key off my keychain. I plugged it in, I held my breath\u2014and up it came, a secure TAILS operating system, cold storage for my crypto holdings, all the social media for Colonel Wayne Osborne. Thanks to my operational backup, I had escaped a crypto bro\u2019s worst nightmare. I was still in business. On the way to El Salvador, I sat down to compose an email to Jacqui, some argument to make her see what she was missing out on. But as I wrote it, I got to thinking: what kind of life was I offering her? This girl who\u2019d never asked me for anything except to honor my marriage vows and keep my promises. She didn\u2019t marry some heavy international operator in the crypto scene. Jacqui had married Mike Luftschager. As I sat there tapping at my borrowed laptop, I realized that if there was one truly useless character in my situation, it was Mike Luftschager. Lieutenant Colonel Wayne Osborne might make a go of this adventure, if he was ruthless, disciplined, loyal, and never set a foot wrong. Mike Luftschager, that minnow among whales? He\u2019d be deader than the Glovemaster in half the time. Jacqui didn\u2019t need that email. The Mealybug\u2019s fabulous yacht took a trip through the Panama Canal, where it changed its name and colors with a brand-new Panamanian registration. Pavel Marco said this would throw off the scent, and soon enough we were in El Salvador, on the fintech scene, the first nation-state to accept Bitcoin as legal tender. We moved into the brand new complex next to the volcano-powered Bitcoin mines. The Mealybug seemed pleased about her new lair, but the shock of this novelty was too much for Marco\u2014after his long illness, he went into sudden decline. He died in a marvelous place, though\u2014like a chunk of Dubai glittering at the base of Conchagua. Huge tin barns full of round-the-clock computation, a government-private partnership like structures dropped off a starship. I was there when Pavel gave up the ghost\u2014still at his laptop, with all his secure passwords and wallets sitting wide-open. A handy development, because those new resources helped me manage the hustle of secretly burying a dead white spy in a Third World country. With Pavel Marco gone, someone had to take on the role of the Mealybug\u2019s protector and global financial agent. The best guy for that job was not Mike Luftschager, or Lieutenant Colonel Wayne Osborne, either. The ideal protector for the Mealybug was the famous and fearsome Pavel Marco. So for her sake, I ditched the useless Mike Luftschager. I rugpulled Wayne Osborne. I became Pavel Marco. My soul felt settled by this. I had to die inside a little\u2014when a man abandons sworn oaths and core values, that happens to him. But I saw with incisive sharpness how my career would flourish. The truth was simple: the future was not about me and my corny personal convictions. It was about creating a world safe for the Mealybug and her values. Those laser-eyed dudes behind the El Salvador government, they were clued-in about that. Hard headed libertarian visionaries from a sovereign nation. No one-world control freaks. No bureaucrats and bank gangsters. Pavel Marco could blaze new trails in that world. Who would miss Mike Luftschager? Well, Jacqui might, for a little while . . . but in Miami, the Bitcoin capital, she had found new purpose. I spied on her, off and on, as best I could. That \u201cclassy older lady\u201d she\u2019d made friends with in Miami turned out to be a socialite Republican Party operative. As NFT art collectors went, she seemed very active. Jacqui started with the NFT collections, but pretty soon she was into election truthing, and then immigration policies. Her charm came to the fore: she got her teeth done, and the blonde hair of a Fox News anchorwoman. Like she\u2019d predicted, she became an influencer: first the little podcasts, then the big YouTube shows, and finally the Build the Wall Movement, where she and her WASP friends fought to protect the world from alien invaders. Those alien invasion memes were a big hit with the QAnon people. They adored Jacqui. So I was proud of her, but she wasn\u2019t the girl I had married. At the sight of her yakking politics on camera, I went kinda numb below the belt. Also, she would have gotten the Mealybug killed, so she just wasn\u2019t someone I could have anything to do with. It happens. Sad. That\u2019s why I arranged this talk with you. The Mealybug may not be a social insect, but she does need allies. For her cause. You know my story now, and judging by your proven interest, you\u2019re a woman I can trust to help get the word out. Believe me: although crypto has been through a whole lot of ups and downs, we are Very Early Days, still. When she\u2019s not laying her eggs in the jungle, the Mealybug keeps busy: DeFi apps and protocol, a whole ecosystem. The Huxley Blockchain? That\u2019s her. The Brave New World Coder Club, also hers. She\u2019s yield farming. She\u2019s growing the TVL so we can capitalize. I can\u2019t even count the pseudonymous profiles she\u2019s created, a voluntary association of invented people, all contributing code to her Huxley ecosystem, creating apps and wallets, governance platforms, aggregators, and stablecoins. It\u2019s all happening right in front of our eyes. The future of wealth, right here, right now. It\u2019s just that the normies can\u2019t see it. So thanks again for coming down to see me here in the compound. I don\u2019t get around like I used to\u2014my health\u2019s not what it was. There\u2019s this need for absolute security; bandits and predators all over the place. Her enemies aren\u2019t sleeping. Neither am I, much, lately\u2014I\u2019m on watch every hour of the day. But I\u2019ve put aside the drugs and the booze\u2014I don\u2019t need those false highs. Not with my laser-focus on my new sense of purpose\u2014and that can be yours, too! Every day an adventure!

And it\u2019s very easy to pick up too much junk and suddenly find yourself overencumbered, unable to fast-travel or sprint as much as usual. That\u2019s no fun! But you can avoid this annoying situation. I\u2019ve played about 55 hours of so far, and for most of that time, I\u2019ve not been overencumbered. In fact, I\u2019m usually carrying under 100kg of weight at any given time. What\u2019s my secret? Well, , I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at managing all the weapons, health items, and junk you collect as you adventure through the studio\u2019s massive open-world RPGs. So let me help you stop being overencumbered with these tips and tricks! Look, okay, I know this is very obvious and all that, but\u2026yeah, stop grabbing everything! I get it. This is a Bethesda game and one of the joys of these RPGs is how everything can be grabbed, manipulated, stored, and sold. Every plastic cup and dart and sandwich. But you don\u2019t need to grab it all. Well, sure, but you won\u2019t get that for that junk. And there are better ways to make credits in this game, like doing quests and selling high-value items like rare suits, guns, and very lightweight objects that are worth hundreds of credits. So yeah, stop. Put that cup down. Walk away. Leave it. Leave it! I\u2019m watching. Certain stats are always useful in a Bethesda open-world RPG. Having extra health and the ability to lockpick anything, for example, are as handy in as they were in . Similarly, leveling up the skill that lets you carry more stuff without becoming overencumbered is very useful. I also recommend grabbing this early so you can start grinding away at its requirements to unlock higher levels. Trust me, this will save you time in the long run. You can sort your by weight and you should do this regularly, as you\u2019ll often find some random spacesuit or other item taking up a large chunk of your carrying capacity. Take care of these items and don\u2019t let them clutter up your character. While looking at your heaviest bits of junk, you might also find one of the most likely culprits for why you are overencumbered: ship parts. Ship parts! These items are very useful, letting you repair your ship during combat. However, they are also very heavy, weighing 10kg each. It\u2019s very easy to collect a stack of these and not realize it until you pick up a gun and become overencumbered. Making matters worse, these heavy items are found not in your resources or misc. tab, but instead buried with your aid items, like food and health kits. This makes them easy to miss when dropping off resources to your ship. I\u2019d love a future update to move these to resources by default. Until then, double-check whenever you feel too heavy to make sure you aren\u2019t carrying around a bunch of these bulky items. And, one last thing: You can store these on your ship and still use them, no need to carry them around! There are a lot of weapons in , from laser rifles to old Earth shotguns and more. It\u2019s a smorgasbord of killing options. But while I recommend you try everything at least once early on in , after the opening hours you should settle on three or four weapons and sell or store the rest. This has a lot of benefits. You can focus your skills more, carry less ammo, and not have to manage an armory everywhere you go. But also, it means you\u2019ll not be bogged down by 12 weapons all using up your precious carrying capacity! And that\u2019s\u2014 , I told you to put down that plastic cup! Stop! Just because we\u2019re on a new tip doesn\u2019t mean I stopped watching! After you\u2019ve been out on a planet exploring, mining, or completing quests, you should take a moment to drop off excess items in your ship\u2019s cargo hold. Thankfully, Bethesda added a hotkey that lets you send all your resources\u2014like minerals, metals, etc.\u2014right to your ship with one button press. But don\u2019t just store resources in your ship\u2019s cargo containers. You can store rare suits or guns you want to sell later in there too, as well as other items that are taking up space. And if your ship starts to run out of space, well, first, maybe stop grabbing everything. But also, invest in adding some more storage to your ship, which you can do at any spaceport with an NPC starship technician. Oh, and don\u2019t forget: You can upgrade your ship\u2019s storage capacity via the Payloads perk. During my third night of playing , I stumbled upon a legendary suit that let me carry 40 extra kilograms on my character. While you might not find one as good as this, keep an eye out for spacesuits that provide extra storage. If you travel with a companion, don\u2019t forget to use them like a pack mule. They can carry quite a bit, which can help out a lot in big space dungeons filled with good loot. Just talk to your companion and ask to trade, then shove all the plastic cups and crappy guns into their inventory so you can sell it all later. Perhaps you\u2019ve done everything above and yet still find yourself carrying too much junk. Well, that\u2019s why I recommend keeping some whiskey or other chems on hand, as using them can increase your carrying capacity. Keep in mind that these are just temporary solutions and won\u2019t last forever. But they can, in a pinch, help you stop being overencumbered just long enough to fast-travel and sell all your junk.", "pubDate": "2023-09-07 22:15:00", "image_url": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/6dff2751f8246d889230f8eb86ada865.jpg", "source_id": "kotakugamerguide", "source_priority": 2525, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["sports"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "1ad7818f3de4fe86594a99ac9dccd7f5", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 Wants Us Wearing Silver to Her Shows This Month, Time to Get in Formation", "link": "https://www.theroot.com/beyonce-wants-us-wearing-silver-to-her-shows-this-month-1850813932", "keywords": ["keke palmer", "tracee ellis ross", "nike", "amazon", "chuck taylor", "forever 21", "erin mini skirt", "silver air force", "oes", "amy lynn", "skirt", "steve madden", "miniskirt", "bodysuit", "sewing", "bey", "fashion", "urban outfitters", "embellishment", "yara shahidi", "queen bey", "human interest"], "creator": ["Angela Johnson"], "video_url": null, "description": "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Renaissance World Tour is coming to an end (sniff), but the superstar is planning to go out with a bang.

These expensive raw materials are essential components of our various solar energy technologies. What about neodymium, praseodymium and dysprosium? These rare earth metals are used to build the powerful magnets in wind turbines . Keeping our planet livable requires accelerated clean energy transitions by governments\u2014 global carbon emissions must halve by 2030 and achieve net-zero by 2050. But a more ambitious clean energy transition requires more of the metals and minerals used to build clean energy technologies. As the global energy sector shifts from fossil fuels to clean energy , the demand of precious metals \u2014known as critical minerals \u2014is increasing. A striking example is lithium, a metal used in electric vehicle batteries. Between 2018 and 2022, the demand for lithium increased by 25% per year . Under a net-zero scenario, lithium demand by 2040 could be more than 40 times what it was in 2020 . The current challenge lies in a supply and demand mismatch. The projected demand for critical minerals exceeds the available supply. Basic principles of economics dictate higher prices for these minerals. In addition, critical minerals have a geographically concentrated supply. These metals are only extracted from a handful of countries and are overwhelmingly processed in China . China, for example, extracts 60% and processes 90% of all rare earth elements. In comparison, the top oil-producing country\u2014the United States\u2014accounts for only 18% of the extraction and 20% of the processing of the whole industry . The geographical concentration may result in additional supply constraints. Indonesia, the world's first nickel producer, has progressively banned the export of nickel ore overseas in an attempt to strengthen domestic processing. The lack of geographical diversity in supply can increase price volatility. Lithium prices rose more than 400% in 2022, before dropping again by 65% in 2023 . Copper prices soared in Peru following social unrest and mine blockades . China, which controls 98% of the gallium supply, created a 40% spike in 2023 on gallium prices by setting severe restriction on exports due to \"national security reasons.\" If supply constraints continue, the prices of critical minerals could become too high. Installing clean energy could become too expensive, and governments may find it hard to reach their clean energy targets. The demand and supply balance must be restored by one of two ways: either by decreasing the demand for critical materials or increasing their supply. The most obvious way to restore the balance between supply and demand\u2014more mining\u2014is tricky. Mining is environmentally destructive and damages ecosystems and communities . Plans for opening new mines in France , Serbia and Portugal have seen massive social opposition, leaving their future uncertain. Opening a new mine can take more than 15 years on average , so projects started today might arrive too late. While some capacity can be built quicker by reopening old mines, and some projects are already underway , supply imbalances are expected to be inevitable by 2030 . Beyond mining, two alternative practical approaches exist. The first is to reduce the demand for critical minerals by clean energy technologies. With innovation and research and development, clean energy products can be redesigned to use less material in each generation. The silver content in solar cells dropped by 80% in one decade . Likewise, the cathodes in new electric vehicle batteries contain up to six times less cobalt than older models. The second alternative is to increase the supply of critical minerals by recovering them from older and used clean technology products via advanced recycling. Decommissioned solar panels might no longer produce energy but can be a valuable source of silver or silicon. Our past research has shown that discarded solar panels could outweigh new installations by the next decade as installers seek to replace older panels with newer, more efficient ones . By recovering critical minerals from this waste in a process known as urban mining , we could cover the demand for the materials needed for future energy installations. Our recent research with our colleague Luk Van Wassenhove compares the economic consequences of these two alternative approaches. If the scarcity of critical minerals is not extreme, reducing the critical material content of clean energy products would be the way to go. However, unintended consequences can be expected akin to the rebound effect or Jevon's paradox : by improving the efficiency of usage of critical minerals, producers can end up consuming more of it. As clean energy products use less critical material, their improved profitability could increase production even more. As a result, decreasing the material usage per product won't necessarily lead to a decrease in critical material demand overall. In contrast, our research suggests that recycling decommissioned products is not subject to such a rebound effect. A steady stream of recycled materials from end-of-life products protects producers from volatile commodity prices and better facilitates the critical energy transition. Setting up a recycling ecosystem requires greater effort than marginally changing a product's design. Firms need a cost-efficient reverse logistics system, recycling plants and infrastructure to get enough end-of-use products back and to process them. Sizeable initial capital investments will take time to recover and require firms and policymakers to adopt a long-term mindset. But there's room for optimism. The start-up ROSI Solar opened its first recycling plant in 2023, making France a pioneer in recovering high-purity silicon, silver and copper from end-of-use solar panels . Likewise, the U.S.-based SOLARCYCLE can recycle 95% of valuable materials in solar panels . Many electric vehicle makers, like Tesla, Renault and Nissan , have started projects to recycle batteries and ensure a riskless cobalt, nickel and lithium supply. Recycling may indeed be the path to affordable clean energy . This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
