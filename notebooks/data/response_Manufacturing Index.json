But the report, titled \u201cBang for your buck: Which Utah schools have the best return on investment,\u201d also indicates much depends on what a student studies and the workforce demand for those credentials. The report, which examined return on investment at Utah\u2019s public and private colleges and universities, found Weber State University is tops for students\u2019 10-year net present value of their education. This was calculated by how much a certain sum of money \u2014 in this case, the future earnings of additional education minus the cost of that education \u2014 would be worth today. The report shows that the first-year returns of graduates of some Weber State University associate degree programs \u2014 computer science, industrial production technologies, nursing and allied health professions \u2014 outstrip the median bachelor\u2019s degree programs. Graduates of Weber State\u2019s manufacturing engineering technology associate degree program \u2014 its plastics and composites concentration, for one \u2014 experience first-year median returns of nearly $69,000, according to the report. The median return on investment for those who earn associate degrees in computer science from Weber State is $58,224 and $48,672 for nursing. Nursing students Kalley Jaques and Aisha Holts work on a central line change as students work in the simulation lab in the Marriott Health Building at Weber State University in Ogden on Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2023. Scott G Winterton, Deseret News \u201cBachelor\u2019s degrees in Utah are more likely to pay off in the longer run \u2014 though Weber State University defies this trend. The most common credential from Weber State University is an associate\u2019s degree, though they also offer certifications and bachelor\u2019s degrees,\u201d the report states. The university also offers a wide array of graduate degree programs, including a doctorate of nursing practice and a physician assistant program. Weber State University Provost Ravi Krovi said the report was welcome news to administrators and educators striving to offer programs that meet workforce needs and help graduates earn higher wages. \u201cWe were thrilled but we\u2019re not altogether surprised. It\u2019s sort of validating, quite honestly. We certainly want to tell our story but when you have data which comes in and proves it, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s even better,\u201d he said. Krovi said Weber State University has made \u201ca conscious attempt to really focus on cost from a tuition and fees perspective. Our tuition and fees have not gone up that much. If you go back to the last 10 years, it\u2019s less than the overall increase in the consumer price index.\u201d The university has made guided pathways a priority, too, he said. \u201cAs students come in, we try to give them a better perspective of what are the options and so I think it\u2019s one thing to give advice, but it\u2019s also important to have the right type of programming. Stackable programs really help us from that standpoint,\u201d he said. A student might come to Weber State with the goal of earning a certificate, which are short-term programs. Once they grow accustomed to the college experience, the hope is they will feel more comfortable and confident about seeking an associate degree or even a bachelor\u2019s degree, he said. \u201cThat transition and transfer is a lot more seamless because it\u2019s all our curriculum, our program. So I think that mission, the dual mission for us, is really helpful for students,\u201d Krovi said. Nursing student Whitney Weston works out a few mathematical problems as she and other students go about their work in the simulation lab in the Marriott Health Building at Weber State University in Ogden on Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2023. Scott G Winterton, Deseret News The report also notes Salt Lake Community College\u2019s large variety of associate degrees. Its computer and information sciences program, for example, \u201chas a first-year return on investment of a whopping $53,628,\u201d the report states. Associate degrees with the highest median earnings include engineering and architecture. Median earnings are also higher than average for public safety, nursing, construction and manufacturing, business and agriculture degrees, according to the report. The report also found that the private, for-profit Neumont College of Computer Science had the highest ranked 40-year net present value of any college in Utah, followed by Brigham Young University, the University of Utah, Weber State and Westminster University. The report explores the financial return on investment for education beyond high school \u2014 or whether pursuing certificates, certification, associate degrees and bachelor\u2019s degrees make financial sense. \u201cResearch suggests that the return on investment for education beyond high school is generally worth the time and effort,\u201d the report states. But degree selection and workforce and industry needs can make a difference. According to the report, more than a quarter of those with associate degrees earn more than the median bachelor\u2019s degree wage and 35% of those with bachelor\u2019s degrees earn more than the median master\u2019s degree wage.

The proliferation of sensors in automobiles \u2014 from telematics to fully digitized control consoles \u2014 has made them prodigious data-collection hubs. But drivers are given little or no control over the personal data their vehicles collect, researchers for the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation said in their latest \u201cPrivacy Not Included\u201d survey. Security standards are also vague, a big concern given automakers\u2019 track record of susceptibility to hacking. \u201cCars seem to have really flown under the privacy radar and I\u2019m really hoping that we can help remedy that because they are truly awful,\u201d said Jen Caltrider, the study\u2019s research lead. \u201cCars have microphones and people have all kinds of sensitive conversations in them. Cars have cameras that face inward and outward.\u201d Unless they opt for a used, pre-digital model, car buyers \u201cjust don\u2019t have a lot of options,\u201d Caltrider said. Cars scored worst for privacy among more than a dozen product categories \u2014 including fitness trackers, reproductive-health apps, smart speakers and other connected home appliances \u2014 that Mozilla has studied since 2017. Not one of the 25 car brands whose privacy notices were reviewed \u2014 chosen for their popularity in Europe and North America \u2014 met the minimum privacy standards of Mozilla, which promotes open-source, public interest technologies and maintains the Firefox browser. By contrast, 37% of the mental health apps the nonprofit reviewed this year did. Nineteen automakers say they can sell your personal data, their notices reveal. Half will share your information with government or law enforcement in response to a \u201crequest\u201d \u2014 as opposed to requiring a court order. Only two \u2014 Renault and Dacia, which are not sold in North America \u2014 offer drivers the option to have their data deleted. The automakers are vague on disclosing to whom they are selling what they collect, though the researchers have little doubt it includes data brokers, marketers and dealers. Partners with installed products and services, including SiriusXM, Google Maps and Onstar, are also amassing data. \u201cIncreasingly, most cars are wiretaps on wheels,\u201d said Albert Fox Cahn, a technology and human rights fellow at Harvard's Carr Center for Human Rights Policy. \u201cThe electronics that drivers pay more and more money to install are collecting more and more data on them and their passengers.\" \u201cThere is something uniquely invasive about transforming the privacy of one\u2019s car into a corporate surveillance space,\u201d he added. A trade group representing the makers of most cars and light trucks sold in the U.S., the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, took issue with that characterization. In a letter sent Tuesday to U.S. House and Senate leadership, it said it shares \u201cthe goal of protecting the privacy of consumers.\u201d It called for a federal privacy law, saying a \u201cpatchwork of state privacy laws creates confusion among consumers about their privacy rights and makes compliance unnecessarily difficult.\u201d The absence of such a law lets connected devices and smartphones amass data for tailored ad targeting and other marketing \u2014 while also raising the odds of massive information theft through cybersecurity breaches. The Associated Press asked the Alliance, which has resisted efforts to provide car owners and independent repair shops with access to onboard data, if it supports allowing car buyers to automatically opt out of data collection \u2014 and granting them the option of having collected data deleted. Spokesman Brian Weiss said that for safety reasons the group \u201chas concerns\u201d about letting customers completely opt out \u2014 but does endorse giving them greater control over how the data is used in marketing and by third parties. In a 2020 Pew Research survey, 52% of Americans said they had opted against using a product or service because they were worried about the amount of personal information it would collect about them. On security, Mozilla's minimum standards include encrypting all personal information on a car. The researchers said most car brands ignored their emailed questions on the matter, those that did offering partial, unsatisfactory responses. Japan-based Nissan astounded researchers with the level of honesty and detailed breakdowns of data collection its privacy notice provides, a stark contrast with Big Tech companies such as Facebook or Google. \u201cSensitive personal information\u201d collected includes driver's license numbers, immigration status, race, sexual orientation and health diagnoses. Further, Nissan says it can share \u201cinferences\u201d drawn from the data to create profiles \"reflecting the consumer\u2019s preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes.\u201d It was among six car companies that said they could collect \u201cgenetic information\u201d or \u201cgenetic characteristics,\" the researchers found. Nissan also said it collected information on \u201csexual activity.\" It didn't explain how. The all-electric Tesla brand scored high on Mozilla\u2019s \u201ccreepiness\u201d index. If an owner opts out of data collection, Tesla\u2019s privacy notice says the company may not be able to notify drivers \u201cin real time\u201d of issues that could result in \u201creduced functionality, serious damage, or inoperability.\u201d", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 21:30:00", "image_url": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/helenair.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/f9/0f91ef67-6f5b-530e-bcd1-66d8e5747df1/64fa828a2e68e.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200", "source_id": "helenair", "source_priority": 36771, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "ce4b223f64c726de96496951e3504f0d", "title": "Business Highlights: IRS launches crackdown on millionaires with back taxes; iPhone security update", "link": "https://qz.com/business-highlights-irs-launches-crackdown-on-milliona-1850819875", "keywords": null, "creator": ["The Associated Press"], "video_url": null, "description": "___Read more...", "content": "___ The IRS plans to crack down on 1,600 millionaires to collect millions of dollars in back taxes WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The IRS is launching an effort to crack down on 1,600 millionaires and 75 large business partnerships that owe hundreds of millions of dollars in past due taxes. IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel says that with a boost in federal funding and the help of artificial intelligence tools, the agency has new means of targeting rich people who\u2019ve \u201ccut corners\u201d on their taxes. The IRS announced the effort on Friday. The IRS is trying to showcase positive results from its burst of new funding under President Joe Biden\u2019s Democratic administration. Republicans in Congress are looking to claw back some of that money. ___ Stock market today: Wall Street closes its worst week in the last 3 with a quiet finish NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Stocks drifted to a slightly higher close on Wall Street but still closed out their first losing week in the last three. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% Friday following three straight days of declines. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 75 points, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.1%. Treasury yields held relatively steady, helping to keep trading quiet. Strong reports on the economy earlier in the week sent yields higher and raised worries the Federal Reserve may keep interest rates higher for longer. High rates can slow inflation, but they hurt investment prices. ___ Germany will keep Russian oil giant Rosneft subsidiaries under its control for another 6 months BERLIN (AP) \u2014 The German government says it will keep two subsidiaries of Russian oil giant Rosneft under the control of German authorities for another six months. The government announced a year ago that it was putting the units under the administration of Germany\u2019s Federal Network Agency. In March, a German federal court threw out complaints from Rosneft and upheld the decision. The trusteeship gave German authorities control of three Russian-owned refineries. Rosneft accounted at the time for about 12% of Germany\u2019s oil refining capacity. The Economy Ministry said Friday that it is extending the trusteeship again until March 10 next year \u201cto secure the energy supply.\u201d ___ Update your iPhone: Apple just pushed out a significant security update Apple released a significant security update for iPhones and iPads Thursday to patch newly discovered security vulnerabilities in the devices\u2019 system software. The issue was discovered by researchers at the University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab, who said the software flaw was being \u201cactively exploited\u201d to deliver commercial spyware called Pegasus developed and sold by the Israeli company NSO Group. Pegasus is an expensive tool typically used to target dissidents, journalists and political opponents, so ordinary users likely have little to fear. Still, Citizen Lab recommends that all users should immediately update their devices. ___ Puerto Rico\u2019s public schools clamor for air conditioning to get relief from record-breaking heat SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) \u2014 Students and teachers are sweltering in public schools across Puerto Rico and demanding that the government install air conditioners as the U.S. Caribbean territory bakes under record heat this year. But the island\u2019s governor quietly vetoed a bill last month that would authorize the installation of cooling systems in a move that outraged many. The island\u2019s Department of Education has taken steps including allowing students to wear Bermuda shorts as it considers modifying schedules to cooler hours. The measures have appeased few as heat advisories for the island become the norm as Puerto Rico\u2019s government struggles to respond to the effects of climate change. ___ Kroger agrees to pay up to $1.4 billion to settle opioid lawsuits The Kroger Co. has agreed to pay up to $1.4 billion to settle lawsuits over the toll of opioids. The supermarket chain announced the plan on Friday. State and local governments would get the bulk of the money, though pieces are carved out for Native American tribes and to pay lawyers\u2019 costs. Most of the money is to be used to fight the addiction and overdose crisis. Drugmakers, distribution companies and other pharmacies have previously agreed to similar settlements totaling more than $50 billion. Remaining defendants include some generic manufacturers and regional wholesalers and pharmacies, along with pharmacy benefit companies. ___ The Biden administration wants more money and technology to prevent close calls between planes The Biden administration is putting more money into aviation safety and taking the first steps toward requiring that all planes be equipped with technology designed to prevent close calls around airports. The White House said Friday it\u2019s investing $26 million in things like more use of technology for tracking planes on the ground at airports. And the Federal Aviation Administration is asking one of its advisory panels to suggest how the government can require technology to warn pilots, for example, when they are lined up to land on the wrong runway. The moves are designed to counter an increase in close calls this year. ___ Annie Lennox plans to fundraise and entertain at Rotary event in Italy. She does not plan to retire NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Annie Lennox is not retiring. Though her partner in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band Eurythmics Dave Stewart recently posted that Lennox \u201cwon\u2019t be touring anymore\u201d and would not be part of the \u201cSweet Dreams 40th Anniversary Tour\u201d this fall, Lennox told The Associated Press that she will continue to perform. \u201cI\u2019m not retiring from anything,\u201d Lennox said. \u201cI\u2019m just stepping back because I spent decades on the road.\u201d Instead, Lennox plans on performing at more events like \u201cTime for Change,\u201d a fundraiser for numerous nonprofits, including Rotary International\u2019s End Polio Now initiative. Lennox will perform on the floor of the Colosseum on Sunday as part of the benefit. ___ The S&P 500 rose 6.35 points, or 0.1%, to 4,457.49.

When leadership at the retailer Everlane wanted to make the company more eco-conscious, they set their sights on a tech-driven solution. In 2021, the clothing brand teamed up with the carbon-accounting startup Watershed to track carbon emissions, mostly from Everlane's supply chain, using data collection. The partnership has helped Everlane minimize its air freight and transition some of its production sources from raw materials to recycled alternatives, including cashmere. The company has also reduced its product emissions by 22% \u2014 notable progress toward its goal of curtailing 55% of product emissions by 2030. Katina Boutis, Everlane's director of sustainability, told Insider that Watershed's services give a more accurate, personalized read on the brand's carbon footprint. \"It's a tech-enabled platform rather than a static Excel file,\" she told Insider. \"You're not just estimating on global averages or on some type of monetary spend data that, in the end, may not be representative of your true impacts.\" Everlane is one of several companies using carbon-accounting startups to track emissions and put a dollar amount on their carbon footprints. Accounting climate tech allows companies to automate data collection on emissions from their operations. As the company uploads its financial stats, the software shows how the company's growth projections will go hand in hand with its climate impact and reduction goals. Carbon-offsetting efforts have been made in different industries, but many are nearly impossible to track, making them practically useless . But new startups are turning that around and making it a real part of reducing the effects of industrial carbon on the planet. An explosion in investor interest The carbon-accounting software global market is expected to jump from $15.3 billion in 2023 to $64.4 billion by 2030, Fortune Business Insights reported. Maria Fujihara, the founder and CEO of the decarbonization software provider Sinai Technologies , said companies are keen to understand the cost of their sustainability goals. The startup works with high-pollution sectors such as mining, agriculture, and manufacturing, helping them calculate internal carbon pricing by connecting companies' costs, spending, and savings with their decarbonization scenarios and recommending mitigation measures. Its clients include Bayer and Siemens. Maria Fujihara, the founder and CEO of Sinai Technologies. SINAI Technologies Now that companies have their sustainability teams, they want tools to do this kind of data collection and analysis independently instead of relying on consultants, Fujihara said. The investor demand for this climate tech has never been hotter. Investment by venture-capital firms in carbon-accounting startups surged from $60 million in 2020 to $767 million in 2022 , according to PitchBook . The trend hasn't slowed down, and $333 million has been invested so far this year. \"When I started, no investor would understand my idea,\" Fujihara said. \"Now, everyone wants to talk about it.\" The startup has raised $37 million since it was founded in 2017. Watershed, another startup, has backers including the venture-capital firm Sequoia. The company has raised $84 million since it was founded in 2019. In 2022, it was valued at $1 billion, with clients including BlackRock, Airbnb, and Walmart. \"We're approaching this tipping point where every single company will be adopting some kind of climate plan,\" said Amelia Penniman, a spokesperson for Watershed. Unlocking new climate solutions The carbon-accounting market lives by one mantra: You can't manage what you can't measure. Alissa Benchimol, the senior program officer at the Greenhouse Gas Management Institute , said that the startups' calculation method often begins by loading the software with external data on unit-conversion factors or emission factors and their potential impact on the climate. This information is usually found on open databases of national agencies such as the US Environmental Protection Agency and international databases like the International Energy Agency . Startups including Sinai, Carbon Analytics, and Watershed base their accounting on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a global standard that provides a framework for measuring the emissions of corporations, cities, and other sectors. Alissa Benchimol, the senior program officer at the Greenhouse Gas Management Institute. Courtesy of Alissa Benchimol Functionalities are added to the software to create the company \"profile\" by \"documenting their operation processes, identifying unique emission sources, and enabling year-to-year data storage and calculations,\" Benchimol said. Watershed software, for example, calculates a company's carbon footprint based on financial data that's uploaded to the platform. The data includes all operating costs, including, for example, employees' flights. The miles flown and the money spent are loaded into the system, which then comes up with the emission figures. The startups are helping companies track the three scope emissions : scope 1, which covers emissions from sources that a company owns or controls directly; scope 2, which are emissions from purchased energy that a company indirectly causes; and scope 3, which are all other indirect emissions that occur across the value chain and are outside of a business's control, such as how much electricity a supplier uses or the carbon footprint of delivering the products to consumers. But it's challenging to precisely monitor this since companies' emissions are not the same, and they often overlap. But companies will soon have no choice in reporting their carbon emissions. Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission released a proposal that would require publicly traded companies to disclose all their emission scopes, including scope 3, the most difficult to track. While many companies are sharing this data already, not all of them have been inspired to take action. In 2022, nearly 20,000 organizations voluntarily released their environmental information through CDP , a nonprofit that has run a global disclosure system for carbon emissions for over two decades. The number represents over 80% of FTSE 100 and S&P 500 index companies . \"A lot of companies actually do know what their emissions look like,\" said Lauren Gifford, the associate director of the Soil Carbon Solutions Center at Colorado State University , who studies carbon markets, climate finance, and climate tech. Gifford said most of the startups are taking the labor off companies to track their emissions, \"but having the capacity to respond to that is another conversation.\" The promise of data-driven sustainability Carbon-accounting startups say that tracking is just the first of several steps. Once the company has its data, it needs to implement changes, and that's where technology plays a crucial role. Watershed uses the data it collects to recommend decarbonization solutions, such as clean energy and carbon-removal projects, to companies. Case in point: It's helping DoorDash develop pilot programs, including an initiative to use electric vehicles to reduce emissions from its deliveries. The software also creates disclosure reports, which require the company to answer a series of questions that will be used to score its environmental progress. These reports can then be shared with CDP. Watershed can provide a breakdown of a company's yearly carbon emissions. Watershed The Sinai platform also suggests solutions based on a process of carbon pricing. Its software extrapolates a scenario where the company doesn't take steps to reduce its emissions and a second scenario where it does make changes, and then recommends mitigation measures and associated costs. \"The software allows companies to collect data with more frequency and not only at the end of the year to write a report,\" Fujihara said. \"That gives them more action power.\" Most of the companies, however, are still in the early stages of tracking and measuring emissions or just getting started on implementing changes. Michael Thornton, the founder and CEO of Carbon Analytics, said clients are starting to implement solutions including using renewable energy sources like solar panels and heat pumps. The startup works with small, midsize, and enterprise companies, including Virgin Atlantic. The carbon-accounting startups are expanding their services to offer more than tracking when it comes to helping companies reduce their carbon footprints. Watershed, for example, recently bought the emissions accounting and data firm VitalMetrics to expand its database. Others like Carbon Analytics are seeking partners to connect clients to decarbonization projects. \"The industry is still sort of new,\" Thornton said. \"The powerful thing is that markets and businesses are very good at reducing costs, optimizing, and making things more efficient once they have the data.\"", "pubDate": "2023-09-08 20:10:19", "image_url": null, "source_id": "businessinsider_us", "source_priority": 133, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "b3f900fd6fd03e44c1d13ae0c3e8726f", "title": "US probes made-in-China chip as tensions flare over technology", "link": "https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-probes-made-in-china-chip-tensions-flare.html", "keywords": null, "creator": null, "video_url": null, "description": "The U.S. government has begun an official probe into an advanced made-in-China chip housed within Huawei Technologies Co.'s latest smartphone, as tensions flare between the two superpowers over technological prowess.", "content": "September 8, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked reputable news agency proofread by Mackenzie Hawkins, Bloomberg News The U.S. government has begun an official probe into an advanced made-in-China chip housed within Huawei Technologies Co.'s latest smartphone, as tensions flare between the two superpowers over technological prowess. The Commerce Department, which enacted a series of restrictions against Huawei and China's chip industry over the past two years, said it's working to get more information on a \"purported\" 7-nanometer processor discovered within the Mate 60 Pro. The chip was made by China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., which like Huawei is blacklisted by the U.S. and restricted from accessing American technology. The discovery of the chip set off a debate in Washington about the efficacy of sanctions intended to contain a geopolitical rival and coincided with a move in China to expand a ban on the use of iPhones in government-backed agencies and state companies. The U.S. has been trying to throttle China's tech sector for years amid concerns in Washington that it will gain a military edge. China, which has bristled at the restrictions, has its own fears about the use of foreign technology in sensitive industries and has been seeking to reduce its reliance on American software and circuitry. Clamping down on the iPhone threatens to erode Apple Inc.'s position in a market that yields about a fifth of its revenue and where it produces the majority of its star product. Apple has lost about $200 billion of market value in the past two days, adding to a litany of concerns over China weighing on major U.S. indexes. The shares were little changed in premarket trading in New York on Friday. Huawei's quiet reveal of a mobile phone utilizing technology the U.S. has sought to keep out of Beijing's hands threatens to derail recent efforts of outreach by the Biden administration. The Huawei phone went on sale online while Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was on a trip to China last week, the latest in a series of high-level diplomatic visits to Beijing. The debate now centers around whether it represents a failure of U.S. efforts\u2014led by Raimondo's department\u2014and has raised questions about whether the main U.S. mechanisms to rein in China, including controls on exports of key materials, tools and knowhow, need to be tightened. \"We are working to obtain more information on the character and composition of the purported 7nm chip,\" a Commerce spokesperson said in a statement. \"Let's be clear: export controls are just one tool in the U.S. government's toolbox to address the national security threats presented by the PRC. The restrictions in place since 2019 have knocked Huawei down and forced it to reinvent itself\u2014at a substantial cost to the PRC government.\" Chinese semiconductor equipment makers soared as much as 20% after news of the U.S. probe spurred bets that the sector will enjoy increased state support. That advance was mostly led by companies related to lithography gear\u2014a weak link in China's chip supply chain and one Beijing is keen to develop. Shanghai Electric Group Co., whose controlling shareholder has a major stake in lithography specialist Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment Group Co., rose by its 10% limit. \"We have always opposed politicizing trade and technology issues and overstretching and abusing the concept of national security,\" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters at a regular briefing in Beijing Friday. \"Sanctions will not stop China's development, it will only strengthen China's resolve and capability to seek self-reliance and technology innovation.\" The Mate 60 Pro smartphone employs an unusually high proportion of Chinese parts, in addition to its main processor, an ongoing teardown by TechInsights conducted for Bloomberg News revealed, a sign of the country's progress in developing domestic tech capabilities. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has said he would withhold comment until the U.S. gets more information. \"There's a number of different methods to try to sort of come to an understanding of what exactly it is that we're dealing with here,\" Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday. \"I can't give you an exact number of days but this is not going to be months down the road. We're going to want to look at this carefully, consult with our partners, get a clearer sense of what we're looking at, and then we'll make decisions accordingly. \" In the meantime, Huawei's new devices have spurred an outpouring of nationalist sentiment on Chinese social media, which portrayed them as a triumph in the face of U.S. sanctions. On Friday, Huawei debuted an even more powerful smartphone\u2014the Mate 60 Pro+\u2014in an online video teaser. The Pro+ adds a 1-terabyte maximum storage option and 4GB more memory than on the Pro model, which retails at 6,999 yuan. Shares of Huawei suppliers soared as much as their 10% daily limit on Chinese exchanges after that latest offering hit online stores. 2023 Bloomberg L.P.

ChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement It doesn\u2019t matter if you have $500 or $5 million. Do this now.", "content": "Stocks that offer shareholders great dividends are pretty rare. While it is true that about three-quarters (75%) of companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index pay a dividend, the average yield is only 1.54%. Few companies raise their dividend payments consistently, and dividends may get cut when times get tough. Right now, only 67 stocks in the S&P 500 are \u201c dividend aristocrats .\u201d These are stocks of companies that have raised their dividend payments for 25 consecutive years or longer. This is a select group of best-of-breed dividend growth stocks , most of which have a long track record of outperforming the broader market. For investors chasing yield or who prize the income they get from their investments, dividend aristocrats are where you want to allocate capital. Here are the three best dividend stocks to buy now. J.M. Smucker Co. (SJM) Bets known for its jams, peanut butter and maple syrup, J.M. Smucker Co. (NYSE: SJM ) is officially a dividend aristocrat. In business since 1897, the company has now raised its dividend for 26 consecutive years, making it one of the newer dividend aristocrats in the S&P 500 index. Earlier this year, CNBC host Jim Cramer singled J.M. Smucker out for its dividend , saying: \u201cThis is just a good, solid business that deserves to be considered in the top tier of packaged-foods companies. I don\u2019t think it gets the respect that it deserves.\u201d J.M. Smucker is a company that is always growing and diversifying, often through acquisitions. Over the last decade, J.M. Smucker has expanded into pet food, adding Milk Bones and 9Lives to its portfolio of brands. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.06 per share, which gives it a yield of 3%. That\u2019s well above the average among companies trading in the S&P 500. SJM stock has declined 11% this year on mixed earnings, setting up a potential buying opportunity for investors. Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) Tool maker Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE: SWK ) is more than a dividend aristocrat. The maker of drills and saws is a dividend king, one of the few publicly traded companies that has raised its dividend payment to stockholders for more than 50 years. In business since 1842, Stanley Black & Decker has increased its dividend for 55 consecutive years. That is an extremely impressive feat. Today, SWK stock offers shareholders a quarterly dividend payment of 81 cents a share, giving it a yield of 3.50%. With annual sales of $15 billion, Stanley Black & Decker is today one of the world\u2019s largest industrial product manufacturers. While the company\u2019s sales can be cyclical and trend up or down with the economy , its strong brand and popularity with contractors help to see it through most economic downturns. This year, SWK stock has been on an upswing, having increased by roughly 20% since January. The company and stock have gotten a lift coming out of the 2022 bear market. This is one of the best dividend stocks around. Colgate-Palmolive (CL) Consumer products company Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL ) is another dividend king. Astonishingly, the company behind Colgate toothpaste, Speed Stick deodorant, and Irish Spring soap has paid its stockholders uninterrupted dividends since 1895. The company has also increased its dividend payout for 60 consecutive years. Today, CL stock pays a quarterly dividend of 48 cents a share, which gives it a yield of 2.60%. Few stocks can match this company\u2019s commitment to its dividend and rewarding shareholders. With roots dating back to 1806, Colgate-Palmolive is one of the oldest companies and stocks in the U.S. Like the other names on this list, Colgate-Palmolive is a diversified company with sales in more than 200 countries. However, half of the company\u2019s annual revenue of about $18 billion still comes from its signature toothpaste and other oral care products. More recently, Colgate-Palmolive has been focusing its growth on emerging markets. CL stock has slipped 7% lower this year and looks attractively valued at current levels. Its ongoing dividend increases only strengthen the investment\u2019s appeal.

Smith, an assistant professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry, received the Maximizing Investigators' Research Award, or MIRA, from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences to study the potential that synthesizing small, complex molecules could have on the biomedical and pharmaceutical industries.", "content": "By: Kendall Cooper | Published: September 8, 2023 Newswise \u2014 A Florida State University researcher will investigate efficient strategies to chemically synthesize some of nature\u2019s most complex molecular structures thanks to a grant from the National Institutes of Health. Joel M. Smith, an assistant professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry, received the Maximizing Investigators\u2019 Research Award, or MIRA, from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences to study the potential that synthesizing small, complex molecules could have on the biomedical and pharmaceutical industries. He will use the five-year, $1.8 million grant to investigate two primary areas \u2014 small, psychedelic molecules\u2019 potential as treatment for various neurological diseases and complex, organic marine matter\u2019s potential to provide key insights for fundamental pharmaceutical discovery. \u201cEarning this grant means that the scientific community still values the power of complex molecule synthesis and its role in making biomedical advancements,\u201d Smith said. \u201cMany critics claim that natural product synthesis is directionless and far too arduous. We embrace that criticism as a challenge to improve our craft.\u201d Psychedelic molecules have undergone a renaissance recently, as researchers have reinvigorated investigations into their effectiveness in treating various neurological disorders, some of which include migraines, severe depression, PTSD and Parkinson\u2019s disease. Much of Smith\u2019s research centers on chemical derivatives of psychedelics, novel molecules that resemble the parent psychedelic but contain small differences that hone their biological specificity and efficacy. Derivatives of structurally simple psychedelics like N,N-dimethyltryptamine (also known as DMT and the psychoactive chemical in ayahuasca) and psilocin (the psychoactive chemical in \u201cmagic mushrooms\u201d) have seen rapid medical advancement in recent years, but the development of derivatives of lysergic acid diethylamide, also known as LSD, has lagged due to its structural complexity. Smith and his lab members aim to synthesize LSD derivatives to interrogate how a variety of slightly altered structural modification affect the substance\u2019s psychedelic activity, metabolic stability, and efficacy as leads for neuropsychiatric treatment. \u201cIt is anticipated that new LSD derivatives will pave a new direction in psychedelic science and will lay the groundwork for the discovery of psychedelic derivatives that have an unparalleled neurotherapeutic index, or range of doses at which a medication is effective without unacceptable adverse effects,\u201d Smith said. The chemical synthesis necessary to create these new molecules is made possible by a unique synthetic platform developed by the Smith Lab , which allows for the rapid generation of derivatives never previously synthesized. \u201cDr. Smith earning this NIH MIRA grant strengthens the department\u2019s confidence and determination for the further development of areas at the intersection of chemistry and health,\u201d said Wei Yang, chair of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. \u201cIt is synergic with the university\u2019s vision for the significant enhancement of its biomedical and translational research portfolio.\u201d Smith\u2019s second aim for the study is to create chemical derivatives of marine natural products that have been notoriously tricky to construct. Specifically, he is investigating manzamine alkaloids, which are structurally complex chemical metabolites that boast antimicrobial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity. A notable example of a manzamine alkaloid is manzamine A, a structurally daunting dimeric natural product with a uniquely intriguing structure. \u201cThe advancement of molecules with marine origin is typically stifled by their limited access,\u201d Smith said. \u201cNonetheless, some natural marine products have made it into the clinic due to heroic efforts by synthetic chemists.\u201d Smith\u2019s strategy for both research areas hinges on using feedstock heterocyclic starting materials called pyridines, a type of raw material that often serves as the initial basis for chemical manufacturing of value-added substances. These are unnatural compounds that typically require a chemical reaction to be accessed. A versatile set of chemical reactions improves the variety of molecules that can be accessed from simple, cheap and abundant feedstocks like pyridine. The precise chemical manipulation of these materials is a benchmark area of research in Smith\u2019s lab, and he anticipates that wider accessibility to these unique marine alkaloid structures will open doors to a greater understanding of their biological activity and properties, benefitting scientists, physicians and patients alike. \u201cMy lab is centrally focused on the advancement of biomedical research while also remaining committed to training the next generation of synthetic chemists,\u201d Smith said.These developing minds are destined to discover fundamental advances in chemistry while concurrently finding translational solutions to unsolved pharmaceutical conundrums.\u201d After earning a doctorate in organic chemistry as a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2015, Smith was selected as an Arnold O. Beckman Postdoctoral Fellow at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. Smith joined FSU\u2019s faculty in 2018 upon the completion of his postdoctoral research, and he teaches both graduate and undergraduate organic chemistry courses in addition to his research endeavors.

ECB\u2019s Lagarde (hawk \u2013 voter) is focused on the inflation expectations and keeping them in check:It is exactly when people are paying most attention that central banks should deliver their key communication to ensure that those expectations remain firmly anchored.It will be critical for central banks to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored while these relative price changes play out.Tuesday:Chinese Caixin Services PMI missed expectations by a big margin although remaining in expansion:Services PMI 51.8 vs. 53.6 expected and 54.1 prior.The RBA left the cash rate unchanged as expected at 4.10%: Inflation in Australia has passed its peak. But inflation is still too high and will remain so for some time yet.The Australian economy is experiencing a period of below-trend growth. Returning inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe remains the priority. There are significant uncertainties around the outlook.Services price inflation has been surprisingly persistent overseas and the same could occur in Australia.Some further tightening of monetary policy may be required.Will continue to pay close attention to developments in the global economy, trends in household spending, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market.ECB\u2019s Lane (dove \u2013 voter) didn\u2019t offer much in terms of forward guidance:August inflation data is welcome, but we need to see that continue.We do expect bumpiness in easing of energy, food inflation.Easing in services inflation helps limit narrative that tourism is keeping services inflation high.The Eurozone July PPI beat expectations, but the figures were still all negative:PPI M/M -0.5% vs. -0.6% expected and -0.4% prior.PPI Y/Y -7.6% vs. -7.6% expected and -3.4% prior. ECB\u2019s Schnabel (hawk \u2013 voter) touched on climate change and how it could bring downside tail risks:Climate change is an existential threat with large downside tail risks.Climate-related and environmental risks (C&E risks) are now an important focal point for supervisors.Climate change constitutes an existential threat, implying large downside tail risks.Dealing with financial risks is the core of prudential supervision. Physical climate risks tend to be correlated globally.The economic consequences of physical climate risks could be mitigated by closing the large climate insurance protection gap.In the EU, only a quarter of losses caused by climate-related catastrophes are insured.Fed\u2019s Waller (hawk \u2013 voter) changed his stance and he\u2019s now leaning towards a pause:I would say the risks to doing too much and too little are balanced.The data last week clearly showed the jobs market is starting to soften. Unemployment is about where it was a year ago, so change isn't that big.Recessions are often caused by shocks that come out of nowhere, but the data so far is pretty good (for a soft landing).I want to be very careful to say that 'we've done the job'.I want to see 'a couple months' of data.I don't think one more hike would send the economy into a recession.Data will drive whether the Fed hikes again.Recent data will allow the Fed to proceed carefully.We're starting to see the economy slow down.Treasury yields are about where they should be.The US economy is 'about 80% closed' so impacts from abroad will be smaller than for others.We've been keeping a very close eye on commercial real estate, will continue to roll over during the next 2 years or so.We're not sure about what prices CRE will be trading at in two years.Saudi Arabia announced that it would extend the voluntary 1 million barrels per day output cut through December and Russia quickly followed by saying it was cutting exports by 300k bpd through year end. Both added that caveat that the decision would be reviewed monthly. Fed\u2019s Mester (hawk \u2013 non voter) maintained her hawkish stance as she sees the need to go a \u201clittle bit\u201d higher on rates:The labour market has come more into balance.From what I see so far, we might have to go a bit higher, we might have to raise the policy rate a bit more.There is still a lot of time before our next decision in September and we will get a lot of data and information by then.Gasoline prices are rising again. We have to be very attentive to that.The longer inflation stays above 2%, the more likely it is that the risks will materialise.If we end up raising interest rates too much and the economy loses momentum more than necessary, we can lower interest rates.We will certainly not continue to raise interest rates until inflation has already fallen to 2%. Nor will we wait to lower interest rates until inflation is at 2%.There are upside risks to our inflation forecasts, in my view.Wednesday:The Australian Q2 GDP beat expectations:GDP Q2 0.4% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% prior.BoJ\u2019s Takata sounded optimistic on hitting the inflation target but remains wary of downside risks:Japan is seeing early signs of hitting 2% inflation.Japan's economy is recovering moderately.He believes that the Bank of Japan must patiently maintain easy monetary policy given the very high uncertainty on the outlook.At the same time, BOJ must respond nimbly to uncertainty with eye on economic, price outlook.There's a chance Japan will see shift in public perception prices and wages won't rise much.Japan seeing signs of change in corporate wage, price-setting behaviour.There is sign of change in Japan's trend inflation as rising wages push up inflation expectations.Inflation is already exceeding BOJ's 2% target but there is some distance to achieving it stably and in sustainable fashion.If overseas economies slow sharply, that could weigh on Japan's economy.Stronger than expected US economy having an impact on currencies.Overseas factors having greater impact on currencies.We need to stand ready to flexibly respond to uncertainty.Action in July was a flexible response.ECB\u2019s Villeroy (neutral \u2013 voter) is leaning more towards keeping interest rates high for longer rather than raising them more:There is a slowdown but no recession.Had first successes against inflation but need to persevere.Must bring inflation down to 2% level between now and 2025.We are near or very near the peak on interest rates.Our options are open at the next and upcoming rate meetings.Maintaining rates for a sufficiently long period now counts more than further rate hikes.ECB\u2019s Knot (hawk \u2013 voter) didn\u2019t sound much confident on a September rate hike:Markets may be underestimating September rate hike chances.Bringing inflation to 2% by the end of 2025 is the bare minimum.Rate hike is a possibility, not a certainty.The Eurozone July Retail Sales missed expectations on the M/M figure but beat on the Y/Y one:Retail Sales M/M -0.2% vs. -0.1% expected and 0.2% prior (revised from -0.3%).Retail Sales Y/Y -1.0% vs. -1.2% expected and -1.0% prior (revised from -1.0%).ECB\u2019s Kazimir (hawk \u2013 voter) favours one last rate hike:The preferable option would be to hike rates by 25 bps next week.One more, likely last rate hike, still needed.The alternative option would be to hike in October or December.Inflation remains stubbornly high, price growth expectations too far above 2%.Fed\u2019s Collins (neutral \u2013 non voter) is leaning towards a high for longer stance rather than a higher for longer one:It's time for monetary policy to be patient and deliberate.Fed should 'allow time' when making monetary policy choices.Too soon to say inflation sustainably moving back to target.Fed must balance lowering inflation against slowing economy too much.Fed can likely achieve goals without causing notable economic pain.Still too much job market demand.Wage growth remains elevated.Core services inflation moderation has been modest.Expects economy to slow into end of year.BoE\u2019s Bailey (neutral \u2013 voter) is expecting a \u201cmarked\u201d fall in inflation by year-end:Wage bargaining has surprised to the upside.There has been a very large terms of trade shock in this country.Many indicators are signalling a fall in inflation, which will be marked by the end of this year.Question is: As headline inflation comes down, will we see inflation expectations continue to come down and will that impact wage bargaining?There is not group think at the MPC at the moment.BoE\u2019s Dhingra (dove \u2013 voter) maintains her dovish stance as she expects the monetary policy lags to start affecting the economy more heavily:Labour market continues to ease as MPC's hiking cycle takes effect with a lag.Pass-through of level changes to wages would not necessarily pose a risk to our target in the medium term.Not yet evidence to suggest firms will seek to increase their margins.Domestic factors are likely to continue to ease the pressure on CPI inflation.The Bank of Canada kept interest rates steady at 5.00% as expected:The Canadian economy has entered a period of weaker growth. The tightness in the labour market has continued to ease gradually. Recent CPI data indicate that inflationary pressures remain broad-based. With the recent increase in gasoline prices, CPI inflation is expected to be higher in the near term before easing again. With recent evidence that excess demand in the economy is easing, and given the lagged effects of monetary policy, Governing Council decided to hold the policy interest rate at 5%.Governing Council remains concerned about the persistence of underlying inflationary pressures, and is prepared to increase the policy interest rate further if needed. Growth prospects in China have diminished. In the United States, growth was stronger than expected.The US ISM Services PMI beat expectations by a big margin coming at 54.5 vs. 52.5 expected and 52.7 prior:employment index 54.7 vs. 50.7 prior.new orders index 57.5 vs. 55.0 prior.prices paid index 58.9 vs. 56.8 prior.new export orders 62.1 vs. 61.1 prior.imports 52.3 vs. 52.3 prior.backlog of orders 41.8 vs. 52.1 prior.inventories 57.7 vs. 50.4 prior.supplier deliveries 48.5 vs. 48.1 prior.inventory sentiment 61.5 vs. 56.6 prior.The Fed release the Beige Book which provides recent anecdotal information on current economic conditions: Most Districts indicated economic growth was modest during July and August. Consumer spending on tourism was stronger than expected but other retail spending continued to slow, especially non-essential.Some Districts highlighted reports suggesting consumers may have exhausted their savings and are relying more on borrowing to support spending. New auto sales did expand in many Districts, but contacts noted this had more to do with better availability of inventory rather than increased consumer demand. Manufacturing contacts in several Districts also noted that supply chain delays improved. New orders were stable or declined in most Districts, and backlogs shortened. Nearly all Districts reported the inventory of homes for sale remained constrained.Some Districts reported higher delinquencies on consumer credit lines.Job growth was subdued across the nation. Nearly all Districts indicated businesses renewed their previously unfulfilled expectations that wage growth will slow broadly in the near term.Most Districts reported price growth slowed overall, decelerating faster in manufacturing and consumer-goods sectors.Thursday:BoJ Nakagawa thinks that it\u2019s appropriate to maintain easy monetary policy for now but there are signs that inflation is on path to achieve their target and the risk that it could even accelerate more than expected:Appropriate to maintain easy monetary policy for time being.Signs of change seen in Japan's corporate price, wage-setting behaviour.Still not at stage where we can say Japan has stably, sustainably achieved BOJ\u2019s price targetMonetary easing involves various side-effects.BOJ will conduct flexible market operation when 10-year JGB yield moves in range of 0.5-1.0% range with eye on interest rate levels and speed of moves.BOJ\u2019s July decision has heightened sustainability of its monetary easing framework.Japan's capex, consumption increasing moderately.Japan's economy likely to continue recovering moderately.Our baseline scenario is for consumer inflation to gradually re-accelerate after a period of slowdown.There is chance inflation could accelerate more than expected, though there is also chance pass-through of costs could moderate.Job market tightening but outlook for wages also depends on corporate earnings.Price rises for goods broadening, service prices also rising mainly for accommodation fees.Must be vigilant to risk of further slowdown in global growth.Sees equal degree of upside and downside risks to inflation.Can exit NIRP when economy is strong enough.But there is no preset idea on order or timing of that.It depends on financial developments at the time.Does not want to comment on FX levels.Strong outcome in next year's wage talks would be a necessary condition, though not a sufficient one to contemplate pursuing end of negative rates.Want to look at various factors beyond wages in deciding future policy changes.Further YCC tweak cannot be ruled out but is not an imminent issue now.The Chinese trade data beat expectations but the readings remain very poor:Exports Y/Y -8.8% vs. -9.2% expected and -14.5% prior. Imports Y/Y -7.3% vs. -9.0% expected and -12.4% prior. RBA\u2019s Lowe gave his final speech as Governor as Deputy Governor Bullock will take over as the new head on September 18:My recent focus is risk wages, profits run ahead of rates consistent with return to inflation target.If this risk materialised and inflation became sticky, would require tighter monetary policy.Will be difficult to return to the earlier world in which inflation tracked in a very narrow range.Inflation is likely to be more variable around target.Australia has been well served by a flexible inflation target.Possible that Australia can sustain unemployment rates below what we have had over the past 40 years.Now in an environment of stronger growth in nominal wages, which is positive.The recent productivity record isn\u2019t encouraging; solution fundamentally a political problem.Interest rates influence housing prices but are not reason Australia has some of the highest prices in the world.Issue that defined my term more than any other was forward guidance on rates during the pandemic.Guidance was widely interpreted as a commitment, rather than a conditional statement.With the benefit of hindsight, my view is that we did do too much during pandemic.The Switzerland August seasonally adjusted Unemployment Rate remained steady at 2.1% vs. 2.1% expected and 2.1% prior. The Eurozone Q2 Final GDP reading was 0.1% vs. 0.3% expected as the previous estimate was revised to 0.1%:Household consumption flat.Government expenditure 0.1%.Gross fixed capital formation 0.1%.External balance -0.4%.Changes in inventories 0.4%.The US Jobless Claims beat expectations by a big margin across the board: Initial Claims 216K vs. 234K expected and 228K prior. Continuing Claims 1679K vs. 1715K expected and 1725K prior. The BoC Governor Macklem delivered a hawkish speech titled \"staying the course\u201d:We are concerned that progress in bringing down inflation has slowed.We are prepared to raise rates again but don't want to raise rates than we have to.The longer we wait, the harder it is likely to be to reduce inflation.Monetary policy might not be restrictive enough to restore price stability.Bank is concerned that larger-than-normal price increases for goods and services remain broad based.We are not trying to kill economic growth.The biggest contribution to the slowing in inflation since the peak last year has been from energy, which accounts for two-thirds of the slowdown.Today, about 60% of CPI components are rising above 3% and about 45% are rising above 5%.Looking ahead, we want to see less-generalized price increases as well as a decline in the average price increase.The weakness in second-quarter GDP largely reflected a broad-based slowing in consumer spending and a decline in housing activity.We will be watching wage growth closely.Maybe we don't need to do more, maybe we do on interest rates.We will take decisions meeting by meeting.Expecting growth of 'a little less than 1%' over the next few quarters.You can expect headline inflation is going to go up in the near term, before it eases.Fed\u2019s Williams (neutral \u2013 voter) just expressed the uncertainty policymakers are currently facing:Labor market balances are evening out.There's still more data to come before next FOMC meeting.Inflation is far too high but moving down.Policy is in a good place, is data dependent.We are seeing movement in the right direction for the economy.It's an open question if monetary policy is restrictive enough.The latest consumer spending data has been strong.Expects unemployment rate to rise to low 4% range.Fed\u2019s Goolsbee (dove \u2013 voter) maintains his stance as he prefers to keep rates high for longer rather than higher for longer:It's possible we can get on 'golden path'.Monetary policy is working.Overall level of inflation is above where we want it.Clearly there are risks.China, US government shutdown are among possible risks.We have also had false dawns on inflation before.Want to see progress on core inflation, especially goods and housing.Market's expectations on inflation also have a major influence.I'd pay less attention to wage growth as an indicator of inflation.We are very rapidly approaching time when are argument is not about how high should rates go, but rather how long rates have to stay high.Collectively Fed forecast is that rates will have to stay up for a relatively extended period.You can't change the inflation target until you've hit your inflation target.We have to get to the 2% inflation target, retain credibility.A possible UAW strike could have an impact, it could be material to our decisions.Fed\u2019s Logan (hawk \u2013 voter) called for a skip at the upcoming September FOMC meeting:'Could be appropriate' to skip interest-rate increase in September.There is 'work left to do' to get to sufficiently restrictive policy.Skipping does not imply stopping rate hikes.Not yet convinced we've extinguished excess inflation.Fed needs to calibrate policy 'carefully,' must proceed gradually.Significantly lower inflation in recent months 'encouraging,' but too soon to confidently say on path to 2% in timely way.Job market strength suggests we have not finished the job of restoring price stability.If stronger economic activity continues, could lead to a resurgence of inflation.Friday:Japan July Average Cash Earnings growth slowed down more, and the wages data is something the BoJ is particularly focused on:Average Cash Earnings Y/Y 1.3% vs. 2.3% prior. Real Wages Y/Y -2.5%.Household spending -5.00% vs. -4.2% prior.The Japanese Final Q2 GDP missed expectations and the previous reading was revised downwards:Japan Q2 GDP 1.2% vs. 1.3% expected and 0.8% prior (revised from 1.5%).GDP Growth Annualised 4.8% vs. 5.5% expected and 3.2% prior (revised from 6%).The Canadian Jobs report showed another pick up in wage growth which is something the BoC is particularly focused on:Employment change 39.9K vs. 20.0K expected and -6.4K prior.Full time 32.2K vs. 1.7K prior.Part time 7.8K vs. -8.1K prior.Participation rate 65.5% vs. 65.6% expected and 65.6% prior.Average hourly wages permanent employees 5.2% vs. 4.7% expected and 5.0% prior.Unemployment rate 5.5% vs. 5.6% expected and 5.5% prior.The highlights for next week will be:Tuesday: UK Labour Market report, German ZEW, US NFIB Small Business Optimism Index.Wednesday: Japan PPI, UK GDP, EZ Industrial Production, US CPI.Thursday: Australia Labour Market report, Japan Industrial Production, Switzerland PPI, ECB Policy Decision, US Jobless Claims, US PPI, US Retail Sales.Friday: NZ Manufacturing PMI, China Industrial Production and Retail Sales, Eurozone Wages data, US University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment.

Good morning, Some traditions persist. Nearly 8 in 10 women who marry men still adopt their husbands' last names, according to a new Pew Research Center survey . Changing one\u2019s name is rooted in the not-so-distant history when women had far fewer rights, and some states still required a woman to use her husband's name to vote or obtain a passport as recently as the 1970s. Those who keep their names often do so because they feel it is linked to their identity. It may soon become more common: Only one-third of single women said they planned to take their spouse\u2019s last name when they marry, Pew found. NFL star Joe Burrow has reportedly agreed to a record $275 million contract extension with the Cincinnati Bengals, making him the highest-paid player in the league\u2019s history. The reported deal, which follows months of negotiations, will see Burrow earn around $55 million a year, on average, and follows a series of record contracts signed by quarterbacks during the summer. Hurricane Lee strengthened to a Category 5 hurricane late Thursday, the National Hurricane Center said, and while it is expected to \u201cpass well to the north\u201d of major landmasses in the Western Atlantic, including the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, it is projected to cause \u201cdangerous beach conditions\u201d in the region. The NHC also warned of \u201cdangerous surf and rip currents\u201d affecting most of the U.S. East Coast starting Monday. The president of UAW, the union that represents 150,000 workers at General Motors, Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis, warned Thursday that a strike looks increasingly likely as the union struggles to make a deal with the automakers over hours worked, benefits and a requested 46% wage hike. The workers\u2019 contract expires on September 14, at which point leadership can call for a strike. Just 10 days of an auto workers strike could cost the U.S. economy $5 billion , according to consulting firm Anderson Economic Group. Ryan Salame, a former FTX executive, pleaded guilty Thursday to criminal charges related to the fraud case against Sam Bankman-Fried , the founder of the now-bankrupt company that was once one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. He\u2019s the fourth executive to plead guilty to criminal conduct since the company\u2019s collapse last fall. Apple and Nvidia, two of the tech stocks driving a majority of stock indexes\u2019 gains this year, suffered rare down stretches , losing over $250 billion in market capitalization this week. Shares of Nvidia, the S&P 500\u2019s best-performer in 2023, dropped about 3% Thursday, while Apple shares slipped 3.4%, fueled by concerns about each of their explosive sales. AI research lab Imbue has raised $200 million to build AI \u201cagents\u201d that can simulate human decision-making to complete complex tasks. The startup, one of very few woman-led AI unicorns, has a $1 billion valuation and access to 10,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, but its founders say it could be years away from revealing a product. Former Trump advisor Peter Navarro was found guilty on two counts of contempt of Congress Thursday, which is likely to send the Trump ally to prison after he declined to testify to the House Jan. 6 Committee. Navarro, who is expected to appeal the ruling against him, faces a sentence of between 30 days and one year in prison for each charge, as well as a maximum fine of $100,000. Canada is investigating whether China, Russia and other countries interfered in the country\u2019s recent elections, after a similar probe initiated by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier this year was cut short amid criticism by the Conservative Party. Trudeau has previously denied the possibility that Canada\u2019s elections had been interfered with , suggesting earlier this year that \u201cCanada has some of the best and most robust elections in the world.\u201d The NFL season kicked off Thursday night as the Detroit Lions upset reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs. Here\u2019s how to watch the games this fall , which will air across four television networks and two streaming services. Women soccer players in Spain are striking after failing to come to an agreement with the league on better pay as Spanish soccer continues to deal with the aftermath of its chief nonconsensually kissing a female player after the country\u2019s World Cup win. The biggest point of contention is pay: The minimum salary for men in the first division of La Liga is $197,000, the Associated Press reported, and for women it\u2019s $17,400. The Energy Department announced a $20 million fund Thursday to help companies and researchers find low-cost, sustainable ways to extract underground hydrogen and stimulate that natural process that creates the energy-rich element. It\u2019s part of a push to expand U.S. production of carbon-free energy to help fight climate change, and geologic hydrogen is particularly attractive because it would be the lowest-cost form of the fuel. Power system manufacturer FuelCell Energy and carmaker Toyota have deployed the world\u2019s first \u201ctri-gen\u201d system that turns methane-rich waste gas into electricity, clean hydrogen and water, and the companies said Thursday the facility is fully complete . Toyota\u2019s contract to use it runs for 20 years and should eliminate more than 9,000 tons of CO2 annually , the companies said, amid a broad push for greater use of hydrogen from sources that don\u2019t generate carbon dioxide. TOPLINE Critics say Apple has failed to develop a sustained, successful response to child exploitation materials on its services and fallen far behind competitors in helping police catch the criminals who proliferate it. A Forbes review of some 100 federal cases in which investigators searched Apple technologies, believing they were used in furtherance of child exploitation, found that the company\u2019s systems have been used to store and transmit thousands of items of CSAM, or child sexual abuse material, between 2014 and 2023. But unlike peers like Google and Meta, which proactively scan their services for such material and provide millions of leads every year to the nonprofit National Center For Missing And Exploited Children (NCMEC) and law enforcement, Apple reports just hundreds despite having hundreds of millions of iCloud users. Apple spent years working on a tool that would scour its servers for CSAM while maintaining customer privacy, dubbed NeuralHash. It was applauded by the child safety community but attacked by an even louder chorus of voices as a grave threat to privacy. At the end of 2022, Apple scrapped it, and key members of the team behind the project left the company. A\u200b\u200bpple has long maintained that privacy is a fundamental human right. The company famously refused to build for the FBI a backdoor into iOS that would circumvent several important security features and allow law enforcement to access personal data stored on iPhones. In a letter provided to Forbes , first reported by Wired , Erik Neuenschwander, Apple\u2019s director of user privacy and child safety, warned mass-scanning of Apple users would \u201c[open] the door for bulk surveillance.\u201d \u201cHow can users be assured that a tool for one type of surveillance has not been reconfigured to surveil for other content such as political activity or religious persecution?\u201d he wrote. \u201cTools of mass surveillance have widespread negative implications for freedom of speech and, by extension, democracy as a whole.\u201d Child safety advocates say that unwavering commitment to privacy comes at a cost: Apple is essentially blind to harmful, illegal material stored on its services. WHY IT MATTERS \u201cThe tug-o-war at play\u2014whether Apple can scan its tech for CSAM while also protecting users' privacy, and whether it should\u2014isn't new,\u201d says Forbes Senior Writer Alexandra Levine. \u201cBut leaders on privacy and encryption are now concluding that if Apple, having deployed enormous resources and engineering power over more than a decade, can't figure out how to do it, it simply can't be done. And looking ahead, children's online safety issues are only expected to intensify with the fast-growing AI boom.\u201d MORE TikTok Moderators Are Being Trained Using Graphic Images Of Child Sexual Abuse Gender-affirming care continues to be politicized, but a study published Thursday indicated hormone therapy could result in less depression, lower suicide risk and decreased gender dysphoria for transgender adults: 61%: The share of participants who had a \u201cclinically significant\u201d reduction in depression after receiving testosterone treatment 22: The number of states that have restricted or banned access to gender-affirming care 82%: The estimated share of transgender people who have considered suicide, according to a 2020 study The post-Labor Day hiring increase, dubbed the \u201cSeptember Surge\u201d on platforms like TikTok, is when some say companies ramp up hiring ahead of the holidays, though experts debate if it\u2019s real.
