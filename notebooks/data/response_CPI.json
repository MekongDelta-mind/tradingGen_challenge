(Sep)NOTE: Previews are listed in day orderNORWEGIAN CPI (MON): The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced.UK UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES (TUE): Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end.UK GDP ESTIMATE (WED): A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought.US CPI (WED): Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern.ECB ANNOUNCEMENT (THU): 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%.AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYMENT (THU): participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms.SWEDISH CPIF (THU): July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak.US RETAIL SALES (THU): Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July. While the data set will offer a glimpse on the health of the consumer amid concerns that the economy may slow significantly in the months ahead, traders will also be watching the University of Michigan's prelim survey release due Friday, where the rise in energy prices is likely to have weighed on sentiment.CHINESE ACTIVITY DATA (FRI): Retail sales Y/Y in August are expected to rise by 2.8% (prev. 2.5%), whilst there is currently no consensus for Industrial Production metrics. The data will be closely watched to diagnose the health of the world\u2019s second-larger economy and to gauge the drip-feed of stimulus seen over recent weeks. Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d.This article originally appeared on Newsquawk This article was written by Newsquawk Analysis at www.forexlive.com.", "content": ": The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August.

We\u2019ll also review the CPI numbers, and I\u2019ll explain why the latest inflation data is so important. The post Introducing the AI System Designed to Make Investors Money appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "content": "A Note From Louis: Over the past year, Luke Lango and his team have covertly developed what our executives are internally calling \u201cthe biggest and boldest initiative ever launched in InvestorPlace history.\u201d This initiative uses artificial intelligence to pick the best breakout stocks. Specifically, they have created an AI-powered algorithmic trading system that their research shows can consistently crush the market. Their \u201c Prometheus \u201d system doesn\u2019t tell us the best AI stocks to buy. Instead, it uses AI to pick the best stocks ripe for a price breakout. And now Luke and his team are ready to debut their AI system to the public. They\u2019re doing so during a special video demo on Tuesday, September 12, at 7 p.m. Eastern. You can click here now to reserve your spot . Meanwhile, I\u2019ve invited Luke to share a bit more about his new AI system with you folks. Here he is\u2026 ********* Imagine knowing, with a quantified measure of certainty, that a stock will either go up or down significantly over the next few weeks. I\u2019m sure it would make a world of difference for your investment strategy. Prometheus provides that certainty. It\u2019s an AI system trained on hundreds of thousands of financial market data points. And its singular goal is to pinpoint the exact moment a stock is ready to surge higher. It leverages more than 50 technical and fundamental factors to tailor AI models for every applicable stock in the market. And it uses that data to ascertain the probability for a major breakout in a stock over the next month. That is, Prometheus scans the entire stock market every week, and then uses that timely data to gauge the probability that a given stock will surge higher in price over the next few weeks. The higher the score, the more likely the stock is to surge over the next month. The lower the score, the less likely. Sounds awesome, right? Over and over, we\u2019ve back-tested this model\u2026 and it has produced stunning results. Just a few weeks ago, we also started using it in real time. And it helped us find one stock that has since popped more than 50% in just a week! Point being: Prometheus works. It is an absolute game-changer. And on Tuesday night, my team and I will debut Prometheus to the public for the very first time ( you can sign up for our event by going here ). But before we do, we must first explain why Prometheus is such a strong system and, more broadly, why using AI makes so much sense when it comes to picking stocks\u2026 AI Is All About the Data When it comes to AI, it\u2019s all about the data . At its essence, artificial intelligence is a collection of machine learning algorithms that parse through and learn from various data points. The more data you give those \u201calgos,\u201d the better the AI becomes. Specifically, AI needs the so-called \u201c4 V\u2019s\u201d of data to be a robust tool: volume, variety, velocity, and veracity . AI needs a lot of data (volume), different types of data (variety), a constant flow of data (velocity), and accurate data (veracity). You throw a bunch of high-volume, high-variety, high-velocity, and high-veracity data at an AI model, and that model will kick butt and take names. And the financial markets provide exactly that. Every single weekday, from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern, the U.S. stock market is open. It\u2019s taking buy orders, sell orders, options contracts, and more \u2013 billions of them, every single day. The average daily volume across the Nasdaq Composite index is 5 billion shares. That\u2019s 5 billion buy and sell transactions a day \u2013 5 billion data points for Prometheus to train on every single day. And each one of those data points leads to a whole host of others. For example, every time a stock changes in price, even by just a penny, it produces entirely new relative strength index ( RSI ) data points, moving average data points, McClellan Oscillator data points, etc. Every time a stock moves, it generates more than 50 alternative data points through all the technical indicators associated with it. That\u2019s more than 50 alternative data points for each of the 5 billion data points the Nasdaq Composite generates every single day. That means, across the Nasdaq alone, the stock market generates more than 250 billion data points across thousands of stocks. Talk about volume, variety, velocity, and veracity. Start Driving Profits With AI Now As the old saying goes, people speak with their dollars. That makes the stock market a utopia for training AI models. This is why we\u2019re already seeing some of the smartest folks on Wall Street deploy advanced AI models to make money in the markets. For example, major firm Voya Investment Management is actively using AI models to help craft strategies across stocks, bonds, and more. Those models are doing exceptionally well. As of June, they were beating the S&P 500 by about 2:1. I\u2019m confident that within five years every major investment firm on Wall Street, every professional trader, and every hedge fund, mutual fund, and family office will be using AI to pick stocks. Those who do not adopt an AI-powered investment strategy will get left behind\u2026 Perhaps permanently. So, if you want to be on the winning side of the market, join us Tuesday evening , September 12, at 7 p.m. Eastern . That\u2019s when we unveil our new AI-powered Prometheus trading system for the very first time. It\u2019ll mark a huge step in your journey toward turning AI into your ultimate advantage \u2013 your ultimate tool for creating wealth in this new economy. If you want to start getting in front of stocks before they jump 100% or more with near-mathematical-precision\u2026 Then sign up for my video demo next week by clicking here.

While set on the 20th, any new LPR takes effect on the first day of the following month.The LPR serves as a reference rate for banks when they determine the interest rates for (primarily new) loans issued to their customers.Its calculated based on the interest rates that a panel of 18 selected commercial banks in China submit daily to the PBOC.The panel consists of both domestic and foreign banks, with different weights assigned to each bank's contributions based on their size and importance in the Chinese financial system.The LPR is based on the average rates submitted by these panel banks, with the highest and lowest rates excluded to reduce volatility and manipulation. The remaining rates are then ranked, and the median rate becomes the LPR.

Officially reported inflation numbers are not high and not a concern for the People's Bank of China. If the Bank wishes to ease policy further inflation rates won't stand in the way. The next MLF is due on the 15th, the LPR setting follows on the 20th. --- The PBOC's MLF rate is a benchmark interest rate that banks in China can use to borrow funds from the People's Bank of China for a period of 6 months to 1 year, medium-term liquidity to commercial banks. The rate is typically announced on the 15th of each month. The interest rate on the MLF loans is typically higher than the benchmark lending rate (more on these below), which encourages banks to use the facility only when they face a shortage of funds.

The post Stock Market Crash Alert: Mark Your Calendars for Sept. 13 appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "content": "With concerns of a recession \u2014 or stock market crash \u2014 in full swing, next week\u2019s Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) report represents perhaps the single most important economic data release ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s upcoming policy decision. Indeed, the CPI report may offer insight into whether the Fed\u2019s war on inflation is coming to a soft or emergency landing. After a surprising increase in prices in July, economists are crossing their fingers that price growth cooled in August. The headline CPI rose 3.2% on an annual basis in July, the first acceleration in more than a year. July\u2019s hotter-than-expected inflation has stoked fears that the Fed may push the rate hike button again soon. As such, next week\u2019s CPI report may force the Fed\u2019s hand at its next policy meeting, Sept. 19-20. With just days between the August CPI and the FOMC meeting, the inflation data will likely prove Fed members\u2019 final consideration before coming to a decision. And what a decision it will be. Even with fears of an imminent economic pullback eating up Wall Street, members of the Fed still aren\u2019t satisfied with the current 5.5% benchmark rate. At the annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted that rates are liable to remain elevated \u2014 or even increase \u2014 in the foreseeable future. \u201cWe are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective,\u201d he said. Recession Indicators Loom Large The major concern here is that should inflation come in higher than expected, the Fed may be pressed to raise rates yet again, a possibility that further aggravates recessionary tension in in the U.S. economy. Now, the soft-landers will argue that metrics like unemployment and consumer spending, which typically deteriorate during a recession, have been surprisingly resilient. Which has been true, at least, until recently. Indeed, the latest jobs report showed a surprising 0.3% increase in unemployment, to 3.8%, the highest level since February 2022. While this is still historically fairly strong, it also offers some validity to those suggesting an interest rate-induced recession is on the way. \u201cThe labor market is clearly cooling, with job openings falling and job growth slowing closer to sustainable levels based on the most recent data, but remains tight,\u201d said Goldman Sachs\u2019 Joseph Briggs . While 3.8% unemployment isn\u2019t itself bad, it\u2019s the suggestion that it may just be the start of a wider, more malicious downturn that has economists and analysts terrified. There\u2019s some data that suggest that consumer spending has largely been propped up by savings and debt expenditures. In fact, credit card debt recently hit $1 trillion for the first time in history. Will the CPI Cause a Stock Market Crash? The fear is that a red-hot inflation report will invite more rate hikes, which will likely invite a slowdown in hiring, which will, in itself, invite a reversal in spending. When consumer spending falls, so do earnings. And when earnings crash, well, so does the wider stock market. The notion that the economy hasn\u2019t fully digested the full brunt of the Fed\u2019s previous rate hikes is an even more terrifying suggestion, given the overwhelming expectation that the central bank isn\u2019t done raising rates yet. Should everything hit all at once, the notion of a soft landing quickly devolves into an emergency landing as the economy slips into recession.

Energy is the one safe haven in September so far. In between earnings season, the market defaults to economic data for guidance and how that may impact earnings estimates. Right now what the bond market does is leading stocks, by being a vote on inflation trends that will drive the Fed\u2019s monetary moves. This week we\u2019ve watched the US 10yr go from below 4.20% to above 4.30%, and today back to just above 4.21% this morning. Stocks have generally followed these moves, though have taken more heat than bonds moves as the volatility on top of the cautious consideration of the weak seasonality of September has created more sellers than buyers. As of Friday morning, for the first 5 trading days of September we find the Dow down 0.9%, the S&P down 1.25%, both the NASDAQ and QQQ down 1.5%, with the Russell 2000 bringing up the rear at down 3.3%. The bias is to bigger, higher quality companies, though the megatech have certainly revealed they too react to interest rates.

This has wiped out $200B in market value, though it is bouncing this morning, up 1.3% and still up 43.5% YTD. Energy prices are up again, with crude back over $87.50 and the XLE up 3% in September.

Recession fears continue to ebb and earnings estimates remain firm or inching higher. With weakness continuing in , and Europe appearing headed for a recession, the US should continue to see investment flows coming our way, and help us get to the 4th quarter without too much further damage.

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin High inflation is more than a tax on everyday spending, it also impacts longer run costs through higher interest rates. Chart 1 shows the relationship between inflation (blue line), interest rates (orange line), and the rate paid by small business owners on their loans (gray line). The recent decline from near 10% inflation rates should work its way through to lower interest rates for consumer and businesses, assuming no \u201csetbacks\u201d like those experienced in the late 1970s and early 1980s. But just how much depends on what lenders \u201cexpect\u201d inflation to be in the future when loans are repaid. Inflation and Interest Rates. BLS, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, NFIB NFIB Here\u2019s how the transmission of inflation to interest rates works. Suppose a friend wanted to borrow $100 from you. You\u2019d have to take the money out of your bank account and give up any interest it would have earned. So, what interest will you charge? At least you would charge what the bank was paying you. But the loan is being paid back in the future, and with inflation rampant, that $100 won\u2019t buy the same amount of stuff it did when you made the loan. You need to add something to the rate to cover inflation. And how well do you know your \u201cfriend\u201d? There is a chance that the loan won\u2019t be repaid, interest or principal. You need to add an insurance premium to the rate you charge. This is the process that goes on in credit markets. A simple formula outlines the rate determination: Interest Rate = Risk Free Return + Risk Premium + Expected Inflation The risk-free return for any loan maturity can be determined from the yield on Treasury bonds and notes. For example, the 10-year Treasury bond yield will tell you what you could earn with your money with certainty if you loaned it to the government. The Risk Premium is the most difficult to calculate. Are you lending to Walmart or one individual? Check their financial statements if available and their credit score. If you made a lot of $100 loans you could look at the average loss experience. This is basically what banks do when making loans to many small businesses vs. a large well-established company. Then there is the inflation premium. Loan dollars repaid in an inflationary future lose purchasing power. If the dollars repaid will purchase 10% less stuff, your 5% interest is wiped out. Lenders must \u201cpredict\u201d future inflation to set their lending rates. The longer the maturity, the harder it is to forecast future inflation. Consider the inflation risk in a 20- or 30-year mortgage. Lenders are continually processing new information about the economy and borrowers to set their loan rates, but it\u2019s costly and imprecise (risky). Bond markets do provide some clues. The Treasury issues \u201cindexed bonds\u201d which increase in maturity value by the CPI inflation rate each year. With no risk from default or from inflation, the yield on those bonds compared to the yield on regular Treasury bonds reveals the \u201cmarket\u2019s\u201d view of the inflation premium for any given maturity. In 1981, the 10-year Treasury bond yielded 14.8%, and buying those guaranteed that yield for 10 years! The yield on the Indexed 10-year Treasury bond was 11.4%. The CPI inflation rate was 13.5% (1980:2), roughly the same as the inflation premium. With no default risk, the difference measures what investors were demanding for inflation protection after 1980 and Fed actions. Small business owners reported paying an average rate of 19.4 (1981:4), indicating an average risk premium of over 7%. Banks could always lend their money to the government, a safer alternative but a much lower interest rate (risk vs return tradeoff). The importance of dealing with inflation is obvious from the formula for interest rate determination. If no one expects future inflation, the inflation premium is 0 and interest rates will be lower. The prime rate of interest in the 1980s reached 21%, mostly because inflation was running at double digit rates, virtually guaranteeing an inflation loss on money repaid even in the very short run. Lower inflation means a lower tax at the cash register but also lower interest rates on credit cards, auto loans, and mortgages into the future.

[+] Images) Getty Images Key Takeaways Apple AAPL Under Pressure Disney At Lowest Level In Nearly A Decade Volatility Still Low The big news this week has been the drop in Apple. Following an order from Chinese officials forbidding state workers from using iPhones and other foreign made phones, shares of Apple have come under pressure. Yesterday alone, Apple lost 2.9% and has lost $190 billion in market capitalization in just the past two days. According to an article in the Wall Street Journal, Apple owned 65% of the Chinese market for mobile phones priced over $600. China also accounted for 24% of all iPhone shipments in the second quarter, outpacing the U.S.\u2019s 21%. The ban on state employees has potential to trickle down to Chinese citizens and could seriously threaten Apple\u2019s biggest market. Apple isn\u2019t the only stock struggling this week. Shares of Disney closed at their lowest level since 2014. Investors had hoped Bob Iger\u2019s return would help turn the stock around, but the company has continued to languish. Disney is down a little over 1% for the week. Elsewhere, energy stocks continued their push higher of late. The energy component of the S&P 500 was the strongest performing sector yesterday, up 1.3% and is up 18% from its late June lows. The sector has seen a lot of activity of late, especially with crude oil prices surging. Our customers at tastytrade have been active both in listed and futures products tied to the sector. There is no major economic news today, but next week we will get a read on consumer prices. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is scheduled for release next. Analysts are looking for a month-over-month increase of 0.5% and for core CPI to be up 0.2% month-over-month. That number will be interesting to watch because, as I mentioned above, market\u2019s feel a bit stuck at the moment, and a reading outside of what is expected could be what markets need to get unstuck.

ECB\u2019s Lagarde (hawk \u2013 voter) is focused on the inflation expectations and keeping them in check:It is exactly when people are paying most attention that central banks should deliver their key communication to ensure that those expectations remain firmly anchored.It will be critical for central banks to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored while these relative price changes play out.Tuesday:Chinese Caixin Services PMI missed expectations by a big margin although remaining in expansion:Services PMI 51.8 vs. 53.6 expected and 54.1 prior.The RBA left the cash rate unchanged as expected at 4.10%: Inflation in Australia has passed its peak. But inflation is still too high and will remain so for some time yet.The Australian economy is experiencing a period of below-trend growth. Returning inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe remains the priority. There are significant uncertainties around the outlook.Services price inflation has been surprisingly persistent overseas and the same could occur in Australia.Some further tightening of monetary policy may be required.Will continue to pay close attention to developments in the global economy, trends in household spending, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market.ECB\u2019s Lane (dove \u2013 voter) didn\u2019t offer much in terms of forward guidance:August inflation data is welcome, but we need to see that continue.We do expect bumpiness in easing of energy, food inflation.Easing in services inflation helps limit narrative that tourism is keeping services inflation high.The Eurozone July PPI beat expectations, but the figures were still all negative:PPI M/M -0.5% vs. -0.6% expected and -0.4% prior.PPI Y/Y -7.6% vs. -7.6% expected and -3.4% prior. ECB\u2019s Schnabel (hawk \u2013 voter) touched on climate change and how it could bring downside tail risks:Climate change is an existential threat with large downside tail risks.Climate-related and environmental risks (C&E risks) are now an important focal point for supervisors.Climate change constitutes an existential threat, implying large downside tail risks.Dealing with financial risks is the core of prudential supervision. Physical climate risks tend to be correlated globally.The economic consequences of physical climate risks could be mitigated by closing the large climate insurance protection gap.In the EU, only a quarter of losses caused by climate-related catastrophes are insured.Fed\u2019s Waller (hawk \u2013 voter) changed his stance and he\u2019s now leaning towards a pause:I would say the risks to doing too much and too little are balanced.The data last week clearly showed the jobs market is starting to soften. Unemployment is about where it was a year ago, so change isn't that big.Recessions are often caused by shocks that come out of nowhere, but the data so far is pretty good (for a soft landing).I want to be very careful to say that 'we've done the job'.I want to see 'a couple months' of data.I don't think one more hike would send the economy into a recession.Data will drive whether the Fed hikes again.Recent data will allow the Fed to proceed carefully.We're starting to see the economy slow down.Treasury yields are about where they should be.The US economy is 'about 80% closed' so impacts from abroad will be smaller than for others.We've been keeping a very close eye on commercial real estate, will continue to roll over during the next 2 years or so.We're not sure about what prices CRE will be trading at in two years.Saudi Arabia announced that it would extend the voluntary 1 million barrels per day output cut through December and Russia quickly followed by saying it was cutting exports by 300k bpd through year end. Both added that caveat that the decision would be reviewed monthly. Fed\u2019s Mester (hawk \u2013 non voter) maintained her hawkish stance as she sees the need to go a \u201clittle bit\u201d higher on rates:The labour market has come more into balance.From what I see so far, we might have to go a bit higher, we might have to raise the policy rate a bit more.There is still a lot of time before our next decision in September and we will get a lot of data and information by then.Gasoline prices are rising again. We have to be very attentive to that.The longer inflation stays above 2%, the more likely it is that the risks will materialise.If we end up raising interest rates too much and the economy loses momentum more than necessary, we can lower interest rates.We will certainly not continue to raise interest rates until inflation has already fallen to 2%. Nor will we wait to lower interest rates until inflation is at 2%.There are upside risks to our inflation forecasts, in my view.Wednesday:The Australian Q2 GDP beat expectations:GDP Q2 0.4% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% prior.BoJ\u2019s Takata sounded optimistic on hitting the inflation target but remains wary of downside risks:Japan is seeing early signs of hitting 2% inflation.Japan's economy is recovering moderately.He believes that the Bank of Japan must patiently maintain easy monetary policy given the very high uncertainty on the outlook.At the same time, BOJ must respond nimbly to uncertainty with eye on economic, price outlook.There's a chance Japan will see shift in public perception prices and wages won't rise much.Japan seeing signs of change in corporate wage, price-setting behaviour.There is sign of change in Japan's trend inflation as rising wages push up inflation expectations.Inflation is already exceeding BOJ's 2% target but there is some distance to achieving it stably and in sustainable fashion.If overseas economies slow sharply, that could weigh on Japan's economy.Stronger than expected US economy having an impact on currencies.Overseas factors having greater impact on currencies.We need to stand ready to flexibly respond to uncertainty.Action in July was a flexible response.ECB\u2019s Villeroy (neutral \u2013 voter) is leaning more towards keeping interest rates high for longer rather than raising them more:There is a slowdown but no recession.Had first successes against inflation but need to persevere.Must bring inflation down to 2% level between now and 2025.We are near or very near the peak on interest rates.Our options are open at the next and upcoming rate meetings.Maintaining rates for a sufficiently long period now counts more than further rate hikes.ECB\u2019s Knot (hawk \u2013 voter) didn\u2019t sound much confident on a September rate hike:Markets may be underestimating September rate hike chances.Bringing inflation to 2% by the end of 2025 is the bare minimum.Rate hike is a possibility, not a certainty.The Eurozone July Retail Sales missed expectations on the M/M figure but beat on the Y/Y one:Retail Sales M/M -0.2% vs. -0.1% expected and 0.2% prior (revised from -0.3%).Retail Sales Y/Y -1.0% vs. -1.2% expected and -1.0% prior (revised from -1.0%).ECB\u2019s Kazimir (hawk \u2013 voter) favours one last rate hike:The preferable option would be to hike rates by 25 bps next week.One more, likely last rate hike, still needed.The alternative option would be to hike in October or December.Inflation remains stubbornly high, price growth expectations too far above 2%.Fed\u2019s Collins (neutral \u2013 non voter) is leaning towards a high for longer stance rather than a higher for longer one:It's time for monetary policy to be patient and deliberate.Fed should 'allow time' when making monetary policy choices.Too soon to say inflation sustainably moving back to target.Fed must balance lowering inflation against slowing economy too much.Fed can likely achieve goals without causing notable economic pain.Still too much job market demand.Wage growth remains elevated.Core services inflation moderation has been modest.Expects economy to slow into end of year.BoE\u2019s Bailey (neutral \u2013 voter) is expecting a \u201cmarked\u201d fall in inflation by year-end:Wage bargaining has surprised to the upside.There has been a very large terms of trade shock in this country.Many indicators are signalling a fall in inflation, which will be marked by the end of this year.Question is: As headline inflation comes down, will we see inflation expectations continue to come down and will that impact wage bargaining?There is not group think at the MPC at the moment.BoE\u2019s Dhingra (dove \u2013 voter) maintains her dovish stance as she expects the monetary policy lags to start affecting the economy more heavily:Labour market continues to ease as MPC's hiking cycle takes effect with a lag.Pass-through of level changes to wages would not necessarily pose a risk to our target in the medium term.Not yet evidence to suggest firms will seek to increase their margins.Domestic factors are likely to continue to ease the pressure on CPI inflation.The Bank of Canada kept interest rates steady at 5.00% as expected:The Canadian economy has entered a period of weaker growth. The tightness in the labour market has continued to ease gradually. Recent CPI data indicate that inflationary pressures remain broad-based. With the recent increase in gasoline prices, CPI inflation is expected to be higher in the near term before easing again. With recent evidence that excess demand in the economy is easing, and given the lagged effects of monetary policy, Governing Council decided to hold the policy interest rate at 5%.Governing Council remains concerned about the persistence of underlying inflationary pressures, and is prepared to increase the policy interest rate further if needed. Growth prospects in China have diminished. In the United States, growth was stronger than expected.The US ISM Services PMI beat expectations by a big margin coming at 54.5 vs. 52.5 expected and 52.7 prior:employment index 54.7 vs. 50.7 prior.new orders index 57.5 vs. 55.0 prior.prices paid index 58.9 vs. 56.8 prior.new export orders 62.1 vs. 61.1 prior.imports 52.3 vs. 52.3 prior.backlog of orders 41.8 vs. 52.1 prior.inventories 57.7 vs. 50.4 prior.supplier deliveries 48.5 vs. 48.1 prior.inventory sentiment 61.5 vs. 56.6 prior.The Fed release the Beige Book which provides recent anecdotal information on current economic conditions: Most Districts indicated economic growth was modest during July and August. Consumer spending on tourism was stronger than expected but other retail spending continued to slow, especially non-essential.Some Districts highlighted reports suggesting consumers may have exhausted their savings and are relying more on borrowing to support spending. New auto sales did expand in many Districts, but contacts noted this had more to do with better availability of inventory rather than increased consumer demand. Manufacturing contacts in several Districts also noted that supply chain delays improved. New orders were stable or declined in most Districts, and backlogs shortened. Nearly all Districts reported the inventory of homes for sale remained constrained.Some Districts reported higher delinquencies on consumer credit lines.Job growth was subdued across the nation. Nearly all Districts indicated businesses renewed their previously unfulfilled expectations that wage growth will slow broadly in the near term.Most Districts reported price growth slowed overall, decelerating faster in manufacturing and consumer-goods sectors.Thursday:BoJ Nakagawa thinks that it\u2019s appropriate to maintain easy monetary policy for now but there are signs that inflation is on path to achieve their target and the risk that it could even accelerate more than expected:Appropriate to maintain easy monetary policy for time being.Signs of change seen in Japan's corporate price, wage-setting behaviour.Still not at stage where we can say Japan has stably, sustainably achieved BOJ\u2019s price targetMonetary easing involves various side-effects.BOJ will conduct flexible market operation when 10-year JGB yield moves in range of 0.5-1.0% range with eye on interest rate levels and speed of moves.BOJ\u2019s July decision has heightened sustainability of its monetary easing framework.Japan's capex, consumption increasing moderately.Japan's economy likely to continue recovering moderately.Our baseline scenario is for consumer inflation to gradually re-accelerate after a period of slowdown.There is chance inflation could accelerate more than expected, though there is also chance pass-through of costs could moderate.Job market tightening but outlook for wages also depends on corporate earnings.Price rises for goods broadening, service prices also rising mainly for accommodation fees.Must be vigilant to risk of further slowdown in global growth.Sees equal degree of upside and downside risks to inflation.Can exit NIRP when economy is strong enough.But there is no preset idea on order or timing of that.It depends on financial developments at the time.Does not want to comment on FX levels.Strong outcome in next year's wage talks would be a necessary condition, though not a sufficient one to contemplate pursuing end of negative rates.Want to look at various factors beyond wages in deciding future policy changes.Further YCC tweak cannot be ruled out but is not an imminent issue now.The Chinese trade data beat expectations but the readings remain very poor:Exports Y/Y -8.8% vs. -9.2% expected and -14.5% prior. Imports Y/Y -7.3% vs. -9.0% expected and -12.4% prior. RBA\u2019s Lowe gave his final speech as Governor as Deputy Governor Bullock will take over as the new head on September 18:My recent focus is risk wages, profits run ahead of rates consistent with return to inflation target.If this risk materialised and inflation became sticky, would require tighter monetary policy.Will be difficult to return to the earlier world in which inflation tracked in a very narrow range.Inflation is likely to be more variable around target.Australia has been well served by a flexible inflation target.Possible that Australia can sustain unemployment rates below what we have had over the past 40 years.Now in an environment of stronger growth in nominal wages, which is positive.The recent productivity record isn\u2019t encouraging; solution fundamentally a political problem.Interest rates influence housing prices but are not reason Australia has some of the highest prices in the world.Issue that defined my term more than any other was forward guidance on rates during the pandemic.Guidance was widely interpreted as a commitment, rather than a conditional statement.With the benefit of hindsight, my view is that we did do too much during pandemic.The Switzerland August seasonally adjusted Unemployment Rate remained steady at 2.1% vs. 2.1% expected and 2.1% prior. The Eurozone Q2 Final GDP reading was 0.1% vs. 0.3% expected as the previous estimate was revised to 0.1%:Household consumption flat.Government expenditure 0.1%.Gross fixed capital formation 0.1%.External balance -0.4%.Changes in inventories 0.4%.The US Jobless Claims beat expectations by a big margin across the board: Initial Claims 216K vs. 234K expected and 228K prior. Continuing Claims 1679K vs. 1715K expected and 1725K prior. The BoC Governor Macklem delivered a hawkish speech titled \"staying the course\u201d:We are concerned that progress in bringing down inflation has slowed.We are prepared to raise rates again but don't want to raise rates than we have to.The longer we wait, the harder it is likely to be to reduce inflation.Monetary policy might not be restrictive enough to restore price stability.Bank is concerned that larger-than-normal price increases for goods and services remain broad based.We are not trying to kill economic growth.The biggest contribution to the slowing in inflation since the peak last year has been from energy, which accounts for two-thirds of the slowdown.Today, about 60% of CPI components are rising above 3% and about 45% are rising above 5%.Looking ahead, we want to see less-generalized price increases as well as a decline in the average price increase.The weakness in second-quarter GDP largely reflected a broad-based slowing in consumer spending and a decline in housing activity.We will be watching wage growth closely.Maybe we don't need to do more, maybe we do on interest rates.We will take decisions meeting by meeting.Expecting growth of 'a little less than 1%' over the next few quarters.You can expect headline inflation is going to go up in the near term, before it eases.Fed\u2019s Williams (neutral \u2013 voter) just expressed the uncertainty policymakers are currently facing:Labor market balances are evening out.There's still more data to come before next FOMC meeting.Inflation is far too high but moving down.Policy is in a good place, is data dependent.We are seeing movement in the right direction for the economy.It's an open question if monetary policy is restrictive enough.The latest consumer spending data has been strong.Expects unemployment rate to rise to low 4% range.Fed\u2019s Goolsbee (dove \u2013 voter) maintains his stance as he prefers to keep rates high for longer rather than higher for longer:It's possible we can get on 'golden path'.Monetary policy is working.Overall level of inflation is above where we want it.Clearly there are risks.China, US government shutdown are among possible risks.We have also had false dawns on inflation before.Want to see progress on core inflation, especially goods and housing.Market's expectations on inflation also have a major influence.I'd pay less attention to wage growth as an indicator of inflation.We are very rapidly approaching time when are argument is not about how high should rates go, but rather how long rates have to stay high.Collectively Fed forecast is that rates will have to stay up for a relatively extended period.You can't change the inflation target until you've hit your inflation target.We have to get to the 2% inflation target, retain credibility.A possible UAW strike could have an impact, it could be material to our decisions.Fed\u2019s Logan (hawk \u2013 voter) called for a skip at the upcoming September FOMC meeting:'Could be appropriate' to skip interest-rate increase in September.There is 'work left to do' to get to sufficiently restrictive policy.Skipping does not imply stopping rate hikes.Not yet convinced we've extinguished excess inflation.Fed needs to calibrate policy 'carefully,' must proceed gradually.Significantly lower inflation in recent months 'encouraging,' but too soon to confidently say on path to 2% in timely way.Job market strength suggests we have not finished the job of restoring price stability.If stronger economic activity continues, could lead to a resurgence of inflation.Friday:Japan July Average Cash Earnings growth slowed down more, and the wages data is something the BoJ is particularly focused on:Average Cash Earnings Y/Y 1.3% vs. 2.3% prior. Real Wages Y/Y -2.5%.Household spending -5.00% vs. -4.2% prior.The Japanese Final Q2 GDP missed expectations and the previous reading was revised downwards:Japan Q2 GDP 1.2% vs. 1.3% expected and 0.8% prior (revised from 1.5%).GDP Growth Annualised 4.8% vs. 5.5% expected and 3.2% prior (revised from 6%).The Canadian Jobs report showed another pick up in wage growth which is something the BoC is particularly focused on:Employment change 39.9K vs. 20.0K expected and -6.4K prior.Full time 32.2K vs. 1.7K prior.Part time 7.8K vs. -8.1K prior.Participation rate 65.5% vs. 65.6% expected and 65.6% prior.Average hourly wages permanent employees 5.2% vs. 4.7% expected and 5.0% prior.Unemployment rate 5.5% vs. 5.6% expected and 5.5% prior.The highlights for next week will be:Tuesday: UK Labour Market report, German ZEW, US NFIB Small Business Optimism Index.Wednesday: Japan PPI, UK GDP, EZ Industrial Production, US CPI.Thursday: Australia Labour Market report, Japan Industrial Production, Switzerland PPI, ECB Policy Decision, US Jobless Claims, US PPI, US Retail Sales.Friday: NZ Manufacturing PMI, China Industrial Production and Retail Sales, Eurozone Wages data, US University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment.
