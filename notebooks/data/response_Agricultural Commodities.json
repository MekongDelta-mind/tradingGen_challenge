While global food prices eased in August, those of rice rose 9.8 percent compared to the previous month, \"reflecting trade disruptions in the aftermath of a ban on Indica white rice exports by India\", the FAO said in a monthly report. \"Uncertainty about the ban's duration and concerns over export restrictions caused supply-chain actors to hold on to stocks, re-negotiate contracts or stop making price offers, thereby limiting most trade to small volumes and previously concluded sales,\" the UN agency said. Rice is a major world food staple and prices on international markets have soared in the wake of the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the impact of the El Nino weather phenomenon on production levels. India announced in July a ban on exports of non-basmati white rice, which account for around a quarter of its total. The consumer affairs and food ministry said at the time that the move would \"ensure adequate availability\" and \"allay the rise in prices in the domestic market\". India accounts for more than 40 percent of all global rice shipments. The ban was expected to hit African nations, Turkey, Syria and Pakistan, all of which were already struggling with high inflation, data analytics firm Gro Intelligence warned in a note in July. The Philippines, one of the world's top importers of rice, reached a five-year agreement with Vietnam on Thursday to buy rice. World rice stocks are forecast to reach an all-time high of 198.1 million tonnes, with India and China holding nearly three quarter of this volume like in previous seasons, according to the FAO. This total represents around 38 percent of rice consumption forecast over the same period. But aggregate rice reserves held by the rest of the world are expected to end the year with a second successive contraction, it added. El Nino could also have a negative effect on the next harvests. The turmoil in the rice market comes as global food prices have been progressively easing from a peak last year after war broke out between major grain producers Russia and Ukraine. The FAO's global food price index, which tracks monthly changes in international prices of a basket of food commodities, averaged 121.4 points in August, down 2.1 percent from July. The index was 24 percent below the summit it reached in March 2022. Prices of cereal, meat, dairy and vegetable oils all fell in August. Sugar prices, however, rose by 1.3 percent due to \"heightened concerns over the impact of the El Nino phenomenon on sugarcane crops, along with below-average rains in August and persistent dry weather conditions in Thailand\". Global food prices had slightly rebounded in July when Russia pulled out of a deal brokered by the UN and Turkey that had enabled Ukraine to ship grains via the Black Sea. The FAO said on Friday it had lowered its forecast for world trade in cereals in 2023 and 2024 to 466 million tonnes -- a 1.7 percent drop from the previous marketing season. \"Traded volumes of wheat and maize are all predicted to decline, due to a mix of reasons, including falling exports by Ukraine due to trade disruptions associated with the ongoing war,\" it said. \"FAO has also lowered its forecast for world trade in rice from the July figure considering the stepped-up export restrictions by India,\" the FAO added. An expected recovery of the rice trade in 2024 would be \"modest\" if the India restrictions are protracted and El Nino disrupts production in other Asian exporters, the FAO added. \u00a9 Copyright AFP 2023.

But since early August, things have quietened as business has taken a nosedive due to disruption in the food supply chain across West Africa. \u201cWe used to receive at least 20 truckloads of onions daily here,\u201d Akteniba, who speaks for the market\u2019s 200-member onion sellers\u2019 association, told Al Jazeera. \u201cThe number of trucks coming here has now dropped to between two and five daily \u2026 If things don\u2019t change, most of us will be out of business,\u201d he said. The source of the crisis is Niger, four countries away from Ghana, but also a member of the 15-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). On July 26, members of the Nigerien presidential guard overthrew Mohamed Bazoum, the country\u2019s democratically elected leader since 2021. In response, ECOWAS imposed a number of sanctions including the closure of borders surrounding Niger \u2013 and cut off trade with it. That decision has stoked a brewing food crisis across West Africa. Niger is the key exporter of dry onions in the region, responsible for almost two-thirds of total exports in 2021, according to market intelligence platform, Indexbox. Figures from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC) show that in 2021, Niger exported onions worth $23.4m, making it the world\u2019s 31st largest exporter of onions. In the same year, onions were the sixth-most exported product for Niger. The main destinations of onion exports from Niger were Ghana ($21.7m), Ivory Coast ($1.15m), Benin ($451,000), Togo ($84,500) and Nigeria ($35,100). All five countries have backed ECOWAS sanctions in Niger. But the sanctions have triggered a shortage of onions and other food commodities like beans and millet \u2013 and driven up the cost in places where supply is still available. \u201cThey [ECOWAS] have blocked the vehicles from coming,\u201d Akteniba told Al Jazeera. According to Akteniba, before the military takeover, a 100kg sack of onions was selling at $61 but the price has now almost doubled to $105. A 25kg sack of onions now costs $27 compared with $17 before the borders were closed. The bulb-shaped vegetable is revered in West Africa, where many, including Ghanaians, use it as a staple in their cuisines. Onions are boiled, fried, caramelised or even served raw to garnish many meals. But the cost of onions has become exorbitant as the country\u2019s economic troubles stew; about a quarter of Ghana\u2019s 32 million people live on less than $1 a day, according to the Ghana Statistical Service. \u201cI love onions but for some time now I am cutting down on the quantity in preparing meals because it is becoming too expensive,\u201d Deborah Biney, a 40-year-old mother of two, told Al Jazeera. \u201cBefore the political situation in Niger, I was buying three big pieces of onions for $0.17 in my neighbourhood, but now I use the same amount to buy just a piece.\u201d Onions also have several health benefits, including improved blood sugar regulation and increasing bone density, experts say. Patience Naa Adjeley Adjei, a nutritionist and a home economics teacher, told Al Jazeera that the nutritional value of onions could not be underestimated, saying it would be \u201cdisturbing\u201d if households stopped using the vegetables due to the soaring prices. \u201cOnions have a distinct flavour that adds to dishes and stimulate appetite \u2026 they are low in calories and fat but rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants,\u201d Adjei stated. \u201cThey contain fibre, vitamin C and various beneficial compounds that may have health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties.\u201d Nigeria accounts for 20 percent of the onions sold in Ghana, while Burkina Faso exports about 5 percent of the onions consumed there. Ghana only produces 5 percent of the onions it consumes locally. But 70 percent of onions, valued at about $2m weekly, have been imported from Niger, according to Food and Agriculture Minister Bryan Acheampong. \u201cI deem this an embarrassment and a needless drain on our scarce foreign exchange,\u201d he said recently, at the launch of a government programme to boost Ghanaian food sufficiency. He added that Nana Akufo-Addo\u2019s administration is finalising an \u201caggressive five-year plan\u201d to build food security and resilience by ensuring year-round production to halt the importation of essential commodities like tomatoes and onions. Niger\u2019s military government has refused to release Bazoum and has served notice it wants to remain in power for at least three years before transitioning back to civilian leadership, even in the face of a possible military intervention by ECOWAS. Experts have warned that if the impasse persists, it could result in dire humanitarian consequences and a food security crisis in the region. A study undertaken by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) this April showed that acute food insecurity is on track to reach a 10-year high in West and Central Africa this year as humanitarian assistance is severely hindered by insecurity in conflict-affected areas of Burkina Faso and Mali. The spread of activities by armed groups in the Sahel is also hindering the food supply chain in the region, the onion sellers\u2019 association said. \u201cOne major issue is attacks on our trucks by terrorists, especially in the Niger area. The coup itself is not affecting the supply of onions and other foods like beans and millet that much, but the state of insecurity,\u201d Peter Appiah Mensah, who owns trucks that cart onions, beans and millets from Niger to Ghana, said. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Ziad Hamoui, co-chair of the Food Trade Coalition for Africa, said the economic sanctions by the regional bloc on the uranium-rich country, especially the border closure come at a cost. He called on regional leaders to soften their stance. \u201cI think it\u2019s still important to maintain the regional trade flows,\u201d said Hamoui, who doubles as president of the Ghanaian chapter of Borderless Alliance, a regional trade advocacy group. \u201cFirst of all, you can\u2019t really stop trade by blocking the borders. So, closing the borders on one hand, does not solve the issue. \u201cOn the other hand, there need to be policies where countries can be held accountable \u2026 we need to have mechanisms in place that allow countries to talk together in cases of complaints and challenges,\u201d he added. Some of the onion trucks are also stuck behind borders in Burkina Faso, also military ruled and which has allied itself with Mali, to support Niger. In Ghana, vegetable traders are worried that the vegetables might rot and their value depreciate by the time the borders are reopened. \u201cMaybe, this is a wake-up call for our government to invest more in growing our own onions here in Ghana,\u201d Akteniba told Al Jazeera. \u201cThe only problem is that our onions are very small due to the weather but those coming from Niger are bigger. We need to find a solution to this situation.\u201d", "pubDate": "2023-09-08 09:24:54", "image_url": null, "source_id": "aljazeera_us", "source_priority": 543, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "83fcb03b164264dde2172656b039f879", "title": "Itafos Enters Into Monoammonium Phosphate Offtake Agreement", "link": "https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/09/07/2739811/0/en/Itafos-Enters-Into-Monoammonium-Phosphate-Offtake-Agreement.html", "keywords": null, "creator": ["Itafos"], "video_url": null, "description": "HOUSTON, Sept. 07, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Itafos Inc.

Their short hair is the result of a natural mutation known as \u201cslick,\u201d which Rafael L\u00f3pez-L\u00f3pez, who runs El Remanso, has been breeding into his cows for decades. \u201cIn hot, humid conditions, the slick cows have an advantage,\u201d L\u00f3pez-L\u00f3pez said on a scorching spring morning, walking among his herd in the shade of the milking barn. The genetic mutation that gives slick cows a shorter coat and more active sweat glands helps them maintain a healthy body temperature \u2014 an asset on a heating planet. Cows are most comfortable in temperatures between 41 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit, which means livestock around the world are struggling to cope with hotter and longer summers. Over the span of just two hot, humid days of June 2022, an estimated 10,000 cows died in Kansas. Experts say it will only get worse. Decades of breeding dairy cows for increased milk production have made them even more susceptible to heat. \u201cHow do they produce more milk? They eat more, they metabolize more,\u201d said Peter Hansen, a professor of animal sciences at the University of Florida who studies the slick mutation. \u201cSo any cow that\u2019s producing more milk is going to be producing more body heat, which makes it harder to resist heat stress.\u201d When a dairy cow\u2019s temperature rises above her normal core body temperature range of 101.5 to 102.8 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 which happens when the heat index is greater than 72 \u2014 she experiences heat stress, meaning the ability to regulate her internal temperature is compromised. She grazes less (eating about 3-5% less per additional degree of ambient temperature) and has greater difficulty getting pregnant. That, in turn, compromises her milk supply. Heat stress also suppresses the immune system, leaving her more susceptible to disease. Heat stress costs the U.S. dairy industry as much as $670 million annually and scientists predict it could cause a 6.3% drop in milk production by the end of the century. To cope, farmers spend thousands of dollars running massive fans, sprinkler systems, and even fog machines to keep their cows cool. Cows with the slick mutation, however, appear to be coping relatively well. The slick mutation has been identified in at least six different cattle breeds around the world, including in Carora cows in Venezuela and Senepol cows on the Caribbean island of Saint Croix. \u201cIt must be a good mutation or it wouldn\u2019t have been selected for naturally so many times,\u201d said Hansen. In natural selection, individual animals with traits that give them an advantage are more likely to survive and reproduce; the slick mutation appears to offer an advantage for different cow species in hot, humid climates. Dairy farmers are paying closest attention to the slick Holstein. Traditional Holsteins are the top milk-producing cow in terms of volume, but the temperate breed that originated in the Netherlands about 2,000 years ago isn\u2019t well-adapted to heat and humidity. However, studies have shown that Holsteins with the slick mutation are able to keep their body temperature about 1 degree Fahrenheit cooler, meaning their milk production and fertility don\u2019t drop as much as non-slick animals during the hottest months. \u201cI get 1,800 pounds [more] of milk per lactation from these cows and they reproduce more effectively,\u201d said L\u00f3pez-L\u00f3pez. Research is still in its early days \u2014 scientists and farmers say that larger sample sizes will help them better understand how the mutation affects cows in different weather conditions. For example, a 2020 study comparing slick calves in Florida and California showed that the advantages of the mutation were more pronounced in the humid heat of Florida than the dry heat of California. Still, breeding for the slick cows is widely seen as a promising strategy and is being used by farmers in places like South and Central America, Indonesia, Thailand and Qatar. It was listed among adaptations to heat stress in livestock in the IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment Report. \u201cHot parts of the world are getting hotter, and parts of the world where heat stress was just an occasional problem are going to find that it\u2019s a more severe problem,\u201d said Hansen. \u201cThe more the climate is such that cows are exposed to a lot of heat stress, the more important the [slick] gene is going to be.\u201d The slick Holstein likely originated when Holsteins from the U.S. were brought to Puerto Rico in the 1950s to increase milk production on the island. (Puerto Rico produces about 200 million liters of milk each year, making it the island\u2019s top agricultural commodity.) The Holsteins were crossed with Criollo cows, a breed raised for both beef and dairy that\u2019s become heat-tolerant in the centuries since the Spanish colonists introduced them to the island. Scientists suspect that these cows already had the slick mutation and passed it on to the Holsteins. Researchers also think slick cows may be better able to produce reproductive hormones because they\u2019re not spending as much energy releasing heat from their bodies. Esbal Jim\u00e9nez-Cab\u00e1n, professor of animal sciences at the University of Puerto Rico (UPR), pointed out that in both humans and animals, reproduction is among the first biological functions to be compromised in adverse conditions. \u201cIf a guy is stressed, his sperm count goes down. If women don\u2019t eat well, the menstrual cycle goes crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cA wild-type animal, when it\u2019s fighting the heat in the summer, it will prioritize staying alive.\u201d A 2020 study that compared slick and wild-type cows (those without the mutation) on Lop\u00e9z-Lop\u00e9z\u2019s farm showed that the calving interval of the slick cows was about 1.6 months shorter than those without the mutation. That\u2019s valuable for farmers, Jim\u00e9nez-Cab\u00e1n explained. \u201cIf you have an animal who is not producing, you are [still] spending a lot of money on that animal \u2014 so you want to shorten that time as much as you can.\u201d In the mainland U.S., only a small number of farmers, mostly in the South, currently breed the slick gene into their herds \u2014 but that\u2019s starting to change. In 2019, L\u00f3pez-L\u00f3pez sold his bull Sinba to a heat tolerance-focused breeder in Texas; from there, more U.S. breeders bought up Sinba\u2019s semen to start breeding their own slick cows. Jeffrey Bewley, a breeder in Kentucky, began selling slick embryos soon thereafter. Bewley has spent much of his career focused on cattle housing and cooling technologies. (Most dairy cattle in the U.S. are housed in barns with fans \u2014 just 20 percent of lactating cows have \u201csome access\u201d to pasture, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report.) \u201cDespite all of our efforts to try to cool the cow, there\u2019s still effective heat stress,\u201d Bewley said, noting that cows experience heat stress about 150 days of the year in Kentucky. \u201cWhat really resonated with me was the idea that we might be able to breed for an animal that\u2019s better able to handle the heat instead of just changing their environment,\u201d he said.

The study was prompted by a string of severe weather outbreaks in the Midwest that began in 2020, as well as severe weather that has occurred throughout Texas. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some strong storms across Texas this spring and summer,\u201d said Rebekka Dudensing, Ph.D., Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service economist, professor and associate vice president for the Economic Development and Community Impact unit in the Texas A&M Division of Academic and Strategic Collaborations. The novelty of studying grain bins in Texas as well as the overall safety of structures brought the research team together. The study\u2019s lead investigator is Christine Wittich, University of Nebraska-Lincoln research engineer. Joining Dudensing on the research team are AgriLife Extension economists Dean McCorkle, Ph.D., senior program specialist, and Steven Klose, Ph.D., associate department head, all in the Department of Agricultural Economics of Texas A&M\u2019s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences based in Bryan-College Station. Maria Watson, business and disaster recovery specialist, University of Florida, rounds out the team. \u201cRecovery after a windstorm, like the 2020 Derecho, is a multiyear process for many farmers,\u201d Wittich said. \u201cBased on early responses to the survey we are conducting, common concerns from farmers included the availability of building materials and labor to begin reconstruction for their farm structures. This seems to be a major barrier towards farm recovery.\u201d When asked what advice they would give to other farmers in similar situations, most respondents discussed insurance. \u201cPrimarily, this involved recommendations to know your insurance policy well and to follow up with your agent regularly,\u201d Wittich said. Dudensing said the research team wants to help minimize damage. \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea to check structures for loose panels and to make sure doors and hatches are secured prior to storms,\u201d she said. They also want agricultural businesses to recover quickly and cost-effectively. \u201cThis study will provide information about best practices in construction and in the preparation of structures for storms,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see more grain bins and machine sheds at the edge of fields rather than on farmsteads. Often there are no windbreaks or other buildings to slow windspeeds, so these structures can be more susceptible to damage.\u201d \u201cWhen I visit with producers and discuss their purchase of grain bins, they are expecting these systems to last a lifetime,\u201d said Bryan Davis, AgriLife Extension Disaster Assessment and Recovery team lead, headquartered in District 10, in Seguin. \u201cIt\u2019s a metal structure, engineered so a commodity flows in from the top and through the center. It\u2019s designed that way so grain can evenly distribute into the bin and there is no uneven pressure on one side of the wall. One of the biggest problems we see is when the bins don\u2019t distribute the weight evenly.\u201d Davis said it\u2019s critical to pay attention to these structures and conduct annual inspections to ensure the structure\u2019s integrity. \u201cDuring these inspections, we recommend that producers work in teams with a safety harness and proper PPE,\u201d Davis said. \u201cInspections should include cleaning, inspecting the walls and linings, and reviewing every aspect of the structure.\u201d Producers should also be mindful that the bottom metal rings of the grain bin can rust over time, Davis said. The false floor must also be inspected closely for any defects or sign of wear. \u201cMost of our grain bins are designed with manholes on the top and bottom,\u201d Davis said. \u201cAlways inspect those areas, and never perform any modifications without consulting an engineer.\u201d Davis also recommends checking the footing of the grain bin on a concrete slab. \u201cInspect for cracks or any separation or movement,\u201d he said. This is especially important for those individuals who are using grain bins as part of entertainment venues. \u201cWe advise consulting with an engineer and evaluating the integrity of the structures, ensuring they are structurally stable to withstand a wind event, if and when it occurs,\u201d Davis said. Preliminary findings were compiled as assessments were made of hundreds of steel grain bins following the 2020 August windstorms in Iowa. Another finding was that, after a windstorm, most farmers indicated their insurance adjusters agreed with their assessments of the level of damage for agricultural buildings, center pivot irrigation systems and steel grain bins. \u201cMany farmers indicated they intended for their farm structures to be replaced with enhanced construction that would be more wind resistant,\u201d Wittich said. \u201cHowever, our observations of the replacement structures did not always align with this intent.\u201d She said many farmers want to increase their wind resistance, but their replacement structures may not actually be a significant improvement. \u201cFor example, our structural studies indicate that vertical stiffeners typically provide the most enhancement for wind resistance of a steel grain bin,\u201d Wittich said Future study plans include surveying additional communities impacted by windstorms to generalize findings. Currently, the team is following up with Nebraskan communities after storms last spring and summer. \u201cFrom the engineering standpoint, a lot of our work so far has focused on steel grain bins,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThese are very common structures that had widespread damage in our first study community following the 2020 Derecho. We are now expanding our focus to other farm structures, including center pivot irrigation systems and ag buildings \u2014 both metal and wood-framed. We plan to assess what are the key variables that predict wind resistance.\u201d Watson said there has not been extensive research on farm recovery following disasters. \u201cWe are conducting surveys to better understand what that process looks like after windstorms and to help create that type of guidance for agricultural businesses: What challenges farmers and ranchers face during recovery, what resources are most helpful, and how to better prepare for future events,\u201d she said. Watson said the surveys are especially helpful in understanding the overall recovery of a farm. \u201cWhat impact does grain bin damage have on the long-term capacity and profitability of the farm, and what strategies might be used by farmers to reduce any secondary losses?\u201d Farmer response rates and overall reception to the study was positive, according to the researchers, who are evaluating a follow up study. -30-", "pubDate": "2023-09-07 14:00:00", "image_url": "https://agrilifetoday.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20210502_Sunset_LM_0193-300x300.jpg", "source_id": "agrilifetoday", "source_priority": 964, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}], "nextPage": null}
