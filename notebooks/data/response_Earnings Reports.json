The federal agency said it plans to aggressively hunt down 1,600 millionaires and 75 large business partnerships that routinely \u201ccut corners\u201d on their taxes. \u201cIf you pay your taxes on time it should be particularly frustrating when you see that wealthy filers are not,\u201d IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel said. Each of the millionaire tax dodgers that the IRS set its sights on owes a minimum of at least $250,000 each in back taxes, while the partnerships have assets of roughly $10 billion on average. The IRS is planning to hire an undisclosed number of revenue agents to focus on the high-end collection cases so that the new initiative can start rolling in October this year. The crackdown represents the next phase of an offensive pursuit that the Biden Administration launched earlier this summer \u2014 in July, the IRS said it collected $38 million in delinquent taxes from more than 175 high-income taxpayers in the span of a few months. According to Werfel, the initiative is being propelled by a massive boost in federal funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to generate tax revenue for the nation. The agency is also being added by artificial intelligence tools that can detect tax-cheating tactics that might be indiscernible to the human eye. \u201cNew tools are helping us see patterns and trends that we could not see before, and as a result, we have higher confidence on where to look and find where large partnerships are shielding income,\u201d Werfel said. A team of academic economists and IRS researchers in 2021 found that the top 1% of U.S. income earners fail to report more than 20% of their earnings to the IRS. With additional support and funding, the IRS will continue to hunt larger and wealthier tax dodgers in the coming years. As part of the initiative, the agency promised that citizens earning less than $400,000 a year will not see an increase in their audit rates. \u201cThis new compliance push makes good on the promise of the Inflation Reduction Act to ensure the IRS holds our wealthiest filers accountable to pay the full amount of what they owe,\u201d said Werfel. \u201cThe years of underfunding that predated the Inflation Reduction Act led to the lowest audit rate of wealthy filers in our history.\u201d With Post Wires", "pubDate": "2023-09-10 02:15:26", "image_url": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/NYPICHPDPICT000032963483.jpg?quality=90&strip=all", "source_id": "nypost", "source_priority": 109, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "818c1a18c9163bb3ec1b79e6ffbd53a3", "title": "American teen Gauff wins US Open for first major", "link": "https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/38362953/coco-gauff-tops-aryna-sabalenka-win-us-open?device=featurephone", "keywords": null, "creator": null, "video_url": null, "description": "Coco Gauff, 19, is the youngest US Open winner since 17-year-old Serena Williams won her first major in 1999.", "content": "NEW YORK -- Coco Gauff won her first major title on Saturday at the US Open with a 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 victory over Aryna Sabalenka in front of an adoring crowd under the roof on a stormy day at Arthur Ashe Stadium. After the match, the 19-year-old American fell to the ground and lay on her back on the court before sobbing in celebration. After hugging Sabalenka, Gauff ran up the stairs to tearfully hug her parents and then the rest of her team. Moments later, Gauff told the star-studded crowd, which included Kevin Durant, Diane Keaton, Nicole Kidman, Spike Lee, Mindy Kaling and 2006 champion Maria Sharapova, that she still hadn't fully processed the victory. \"Oh my goodness, it means so much to me,\" Gauff told ESPN's Mary Joe Fernandez. \"I feel like I'm a little bit in shock in this moment. That [2022] French Open loss was a heartbreak for me. But I realized God put you through tribulations and trials and that makes this moment even sweeter than I could have imagined.\" After the match, several high-profile celebrities, including former President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and President Joe Biden, sent her congratulatory messages over social media. Gauff is the youngest American to win the US Open since Serena Williams in 1999 and the first American player to win a major title since Sofia Kenin at the Australian Open in 2020. Gauff also became the first woman to win the title in New York after dropping the first set in three matches during her title run since Williams, also in 1999. When speaking to the media after the match, Gauff said it was an honor to have her name listed on the same trophy as Williams and her sister Venus, who won the title a combined eight times. \"I mean, they're the reason why I have this trophy today, to be honest,\" Gauff said. \"They have allowed me to believe in this dream. Growing up, there weren't too many Black tennis players dominating the sport. It was literally, at that time when I was younger, it was just them that I can remember. \"Obviously more came because of their legacy, so it made the dream more believable. But all the things that they had to go through, they made it easier for someone like me to do this.\" Gauff, the tournament's No. 6 seed, was broken in the first game of the match and struggled to find any rhythm in the nervy 40-minute opening set. Since the first set winner had won 27 of the previous 28 US Open women's finals, history was not on her side. But she took control in the second set, breaking Sabalenka in the fourth game and recording an 81% win percentage on first serve. Her confidence grew with every point, and her \"Come on!\" screams and fist pumps became increasingly more animated. In the deciding set, it was all Gauff. She jumped to a 4-0 lead and withheld Sabalenka's last-ditch efforts and a medical timeout at 4-1. After two hours and six minutes, Gauff was the US Open champion. \"You played unbelievable,\" Sabalenka said to Gauff during the on-court trophy ceremony. \"Congrats to you and your team, you guys deserve this title. Many more to come, I'm pretty sure.\" Despite still being a teenager, Gauff has been one of the sport's most recognizable stars since she burst onto the scene at Wimbledon in 2019 and reached the fourth round as a 15-year-old qualifier. Since then, she's won five WTA titles and reached the final at the 2022 French Open. With several high-profile sponsorship deals and a growing presence on social media, Gauff has remained under the spotlight and the expectations for her career have continued to increase. On Saturday, Gauff said the pressure has been overwhelming at times, and she felt she was expected to immediately win a major title after her run to the fourth round at Wimbledon in 2019. \"It's been difficult,\" she said. \"I mean, it's been a long journey to this point. I wasn't a fully developed player, and I still think I have a lot of development to go. At that moment, I think people were putting a lot of pressure on me to win. I felt that at 15 I had to win a Slam at 15. \"I think that was, you know, not the mistake, because everything led to this moment so there were no mistakes, but that was a little bit of the pressure that I was feeling. Now I just realize that I just need to go out there and try my best.\" After losing in the first round at Wimbledon in July, Gauff brought in a new team, including coach Pere Riba and consultant Brad Gilbert. Since then, she's won the titles in Washington D.C., and Cincinnati and is 18-1 during the current hard-court swing. She defeated two Grand Slam champions en route to the final, as well as 2023 French Open runner-up Karolina Muchova in the semifinals. Gauff told the crowd she had been motivated by those who had doubted her. \"I want to say honestly thank you to the people who didn't believe in me,\" Gauff said. \"A month ago, I won a 500 title and people said, I would stop at that. Two weeks ago, I won a 1000 title and people were saying that was the biggest it was going to get. So three weeks later, I'm here with this trophy right now. \"I've tried my best to carry this with grace and I've been doing my best. So honestly, to those who thought they were putting water on my fire, you were really adding gas to it. And now I'm really burning so bright right now.\" Gauff later told reporters she had been reading comments online from those who didn't think she was going to win right up until the match. In addition to earning $3 million for the victory -- something she thanked Billie Jean King for fighting for as she received it -- Gauff will improve to a career-high ranking of No. 3 on Monday. Sabalenka, the reigning Australian Open champion, will take over the No. 1 ranking for the first time despite the loss. Gauff will also return to the top spot in the doubles ranking, alongside partner Jessica Pegula.

But the report, titled \u201cBang for your buck: Which Utah schools have the best return on investment,\u201d also indicates much depends on what a student studies and the workforce demand for those credentials. The report, which examined return on investment at Utah\u2019s public and private colleges and universities, found Weber State University is tops for students\u2019 10-year net present value of their education. This was calculated by how much a certain sum of money \u2014 in this case, the future earnings of additional education minus the cost of that education \u2014 would be worth today. The report shows that the first-year returns of graduates of some Weber State University associate degree programs \u2014 computer science, industrial production technologies, nursing and allied health professions \u2014 outstrip the median bachelor\u2019s degree programs. Graduates of Weber State\u2019s manufacturing engineering technology associate degree program \u2014 its plastics and composites concentration, for one \u2014 experience first-year median returns of nearly $69,000, according to the report. The median return on investment for those who earn associate degrees in computer science from Weber State is $58,224 and $48,672 for nursing. Nursing students Kalley Jaques and Aisha Holts work on a central line change as students work in the simulation lab in the Marriott Health Building at Weber State University in Ogden on Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2023. Scott G Winterton, Deseret News \u201cBachelor\u2019s degrees in Utah are more likely to pay off in the longer run \u2014 though Weber State University defies this trend. The most common credential from Weber State University is an associate\u2019s degree, though they also offer certifications and bachelor\u2019s degrees,\u201d the report states. The university also offers a wide array of graduate degree programs, including a doctorate of nursing practice and a physician assistant program. Weber State University Provost Ravi Krovi said the report was welcome news to administrators and educators striving to offer programs that meet workforce needs and help graduates earn higher wages. \u201cWe were thrilled but we\u2019re not altogether surprised. It\u2019s sort of validating, quite honestly. We certainly want to tell our story but when you have data which comes in and proves it, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s even better,\u201d he said. Krovi said Weber State University has made \u201ca conscious attempt to really focus on cost from a tuition and fees perspective. Our tuition and fees have not gone up that much. If you go back to the last 10 years, it\u2019s less than the overall increase in the consumer price index.\u201d The university has made guided pathways a priority, too, he said. \u201cAs students come in, we try to give them a better perspective of what are the options and so I think it\u2019s one thing to give advice, but it\u2019s also important to have the right type of programming. Stackable programs really help us from that standpoint,\u201d he said. A student might come to Weber State with the goal of earning a certificate, which are short-term programs. Once they grow accustomed to the college experience, the hope is they will feel more comfortable and confident about seeking an associate degree or even a bachelor\u2019s degree, he said. \u201cThat transition and transfer is a lot more seamless because it\u2019s all our curriculum, our program. So I think that mission, the dual mission for us, is really helpful for students,\u201d Krovi said. Nursing student Whitney Weston works out a few mathematical problems as she and other students go about their work in the simulation lab in the Marriott Health Building at Weber State University in Ogden on Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2023. Scott G Winterton, Deseret News The report also notes Salt Lake Community College\u2019s large variety of associate degrees. Its computer and information sciences program, for example, \u201chas a first-year return on investment of a whopping $53,628,\u201d the report states. Associate degrees with the highest median earnings include engineering and architecture. Median earnings are also higher than average for public safety, nursing, construction and manufacturing, business and agriculture degrees, according to the report. The report also found that the private, for-profit Neumont College of Computer Science had the highest ranked 40-year net present value of any college in Utah, followed by Brigham Young University, the University of Utah, Weber State and Westminster University. The report explores the financial return on investment for education beyond high school \u2014 or whether pursuing certificates, certification, associate degrees and bachelor\u2019s degrees make financial sense. \u201cResearch suggests that the return on investment for education beyond high school is generally worth the time and effort,\u201d the report states. But degree selection and workforce and industry needs can make a difference. According to the report, more than a quarter of those with associate degrees earn more than the median bachelor\u2019s degree wage and 35% of those with bachelor\u2019s degrees earn more than the median master\u2019s degree wage.

(Sep)NOTE: Previews are listed in day orderNORWEGIAN CPI (MON): The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced.UK UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES (TUE): Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end.UK GDP ESTIMATE (WED): A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought.US CPI (WED): Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern.ECB ANNOUNCEMENT (THU): 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%.AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYMENT (THU): participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms.SWEDISH CPIF (THU): July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak.US RETAIL SALES (THU): Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July. While the data set will offer a glimpse on the health of the consumer amid concerns that the economy may slow significantly in the months ahead, traders will also be watching the University of Michigan's prelim survey release due Friday, where the rise in energy prices is likely to have weighed on sentiment.CHINESE ACTIVITY DATA (FRI): Retail sales Y/Y in August are expected to rise by 2.8% (prev. 2.5%), whilst there is currently no consensus for Industrial Production metrics. The data will be closely watched to diagnose the health of the world\u2019s second-larger economy and to gauge the drip-feed of stimulus seen over recent weeks. Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d.This article originally appeared on Newsquawk This article was written by Newsquawk Analysis at www.forexlive.com.", "content": ": The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced. : Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end. : A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income.

In September 2022, the billionaire businesswoman \u2014 who spent her teenage years working in Hong Kong garment and electronics factories \u2014 resigned as CEO of SOHO China, one of the world\u2019s preeminent real estate companies she built with her husband, and took up permanent residence in New York City. Zhang will celebrate the one-year anniversary of leaving SOHO at the 2023 Toronto Film Festival , where the Manhattan-based Closer Media, the startup indie production and financing venture she runs with veteran indie producer William Horberg, has no fewer than three films screening. Horberg\u2019s numerous credits include The Queen\u2019s Gambit and The Kite Runner . Their Toronto lineup includes the Tony Goldwyn-directed Ezra , a dramedy about an autistic 11-year-old who embarks on a road trip with his father. Newcomer William Fitzgerald, who himself is autistic, stars in the titular role opposite Bobby Cannavale, Robert De Niro, Rose Byrne, Vera Farmiga and Whoopi Goldberg. Then there\u2019s The Monk and the Gun from Oscar-nominated Bhutanese writer-director Pawo Choyning Dorji. His new film \u2014 which sparked immediate awards buzz upon screening at the Telluride Film Festival ahead of Toronto \u2014 charts the Kingdom of Bhutan\u2019s transition to democracy in the early 2000s in a parable about embracing modernity without disregarding the past. Zhang and Horberg are also investing heavily in documentaries. Their third Toronto entry is Alex Gibney\u2019s In Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simon . Closer is also among the backers of Gibney\u2019s highly anticipated Elon Musk documentary Musk alongside Anonymous Content and Black Bear (HBO won a bidding war for North American rights). And the Gibney connection doesn\u2019t end there. Closer has a stake in acclaimed Haitian filmmaker Raoul Paul\u2019s upcoming feature-length doc Orwell , which will be distributed in North America by Neon. Gibney\u2019s Jigsaw Productions is among the producers of Paul\u2019s film about the legendary George Orwell. (Paul\u2019s 2016 film I Am Not Your Negro earned an Oscar nomination for best documentary feature). Horberg and Zhang, who work out of Midtown Manhattan office space, spoke with The Hollywood Reporter on the eve of Toronto about meeting for the first time and how they are looking to take part in the content revolution by working with established and emerging filmmakers from around the world. Xin, when you stepped down from SOHO, it was reported that you wanted to pursue being a patron of the arts. Are you also looking for a business return from your investment in Closer Media? Zhang I\u2019ve always wanted both, just like when I was a developer. I love art, I love architecture. I always believed you can bring the highest quality of architecture to any building you build. I worked with really the most avant-garde architects, like Zaha Hadid. I of course also wanted to make money. A film can be the same. It\u2019s a business, but I also want to make the highest-quality movies. If there\u2019s one film that does both, it will be a dream come true, right? Horberg I\u2019ve been doing this for many decades. When I was introduced to Xin, my clear takeaway after spending a couple of hours with her \u2014 I\u2019ve worked with many other high-net-worth individuals \u2014 was that this person is a producer at heart. The process of going from a concept to a fully executed plan is very analogous to being a film producer. The reason we were able to quickly join forces is because we spoke the same language. Working with the best architects in the world is not unlike working with the best filmmakers. You\u2019re managing egos and artists and trying to bring out the best, but get them to play within a certain sandbox. How do you think the strike is going to impact the fall film festivals? Horberg I think people are going to turn out because they\u2019re movie lovers, and I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of energy and a lot of excitement around the premiere of all these films. There\u2019s many directors-actors who are attending TIFF , including Tony [Goldwyn]. Our young lead actor in Ezra is a 12-year-old boy with autism, and he and his parents are going to attend, but he is not going to do anything public-facing. It is such a special event for him and his family, and we didn\u2019t want them to miss it. Does Tony Goldwyn have personal experience with autism? Horberg Yes. Tony is a lifelong best friend of Tony Spiridakis, the screenwriter. This is a very semi-autobiographical script. Tony [Spiridakis] is the father of two boys who are on the spectrum. They\u2019re both in their late 20s now, and Tony has known them since birth. All of us were drawn to the authenticity of the script and its honesty and rawness. Tony can\u2019t do press because of the WGA strike, but he will certainly be in Toronto. Zhang We\u2019re very proud to have made this movie. The film\u2019s purpose is to tell a story the world needs to know. Ezra was originally titled Inappropriate Behavior . Why the change? Horberg It had a double meaning, which is always good. You meet this boy who\u2019s in crisis in his school and at home. And so, your immediate perception is that it\u2019s a kid who\u2019s behaving inappropriately. But over the course of the movie your consciousness is raised, and by the end of it, you come to see that he\u2019s the truth teller in the story, and it\u2019s the adults who really need to wake up to their own inappropriate behaviors. But \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d has #MeToo connotations. We ultimately felt, why carry that baggage? The movie has nothing to do with that. We all agreed to change the title and it was Bob De Niro \u2014 God bless him \u2014 who said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just call the movie Ezra ? The kid is so great.\u201d Bob is a savant. He doesn\u2019t say that much, but when he speaks, you really pay attention. How hard was it to get Paul Simon to sign up for Alex Gibney\u2019s documentary? Horberg Alex Gibney\u2019s the master, but it even took the master a year. But once that happened, Paul was all in. The film goes all the way back to him at 10 years old meeting Art Garfunkel in Queens. Considering the world you\u2019ve inhabited, Xin, what do you think of Elon Musk? Zhang He\u2019s a fascinating character. He\u2019s clearly someone who has incredible talent to have created and built Tesla. That\u2019s not a small feat. But he\u2019s also someone who has, at the same time, created a cult following. It\u2019s very important for a filmmaker like Alex Gibney, who is a clear-minded and investigative journalist, to take an objective look at Elon Musk. I met Alex about two years go and really like his work, so he started bringing things to me. Elon Musk is someone he and I talked about. What are among the secrets to your early success? Zhang I think our company will be defined by being very international . Horberg Our director, Pawo Choyning Dorji, was nominated for an Oscar for best international feature for his previous movie, Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom . He\u2019s the first Bhutanese filmmaker ever recognized for his work in that way. Zhang Another thing we did deliberately was to build relationships within the indie film community by reaching out to production and sales companies about doing projects together. CAA is selling Ezra , while UTA, along with Altitude, is selling the Paul Simon film. A wonderful European sales agent, Films Boutique, is behind our Bhutanese film. And we have two movies with Anonymous Content [ In Restless Dreams , Orwell ], and we also have films with Black Bear Pictures [ Musk ] and Wayfarer [ Ezra ]. Who else am I missing? Horberg We\u2019re also doing stuff with Film4 and Participant. What was it like learning that all three films were accepted into Toronto? Horberg We\u2019re thrilled. I\u2019ve been going to Toronto for 25 or 30 years, and it\u2019s the best audience anywhere. I made the film Heaven with Tom Tykwer, the German director, that starred Cate Blanchett. It was screening on a Sunday morning, and Tom and I were running over to get to the theater, and there was a line of 900 people. I thought, \u201cGod, this is like a cinema heaven.\u201d Zhang I did not know how big of a deal it was until Bill said, \u201cThis is 100 percent hit rate. You should be very happy with this.\u201d It just made me feel so proud as someone who went to TIFF for the first time last year to just watch films.

The report estimates the number of global online gig workers at as many as 435 million people and says demand for gig work increased 41% between 2016 and the first quarter of 2023. That boost is generating concern, though, among worker rights advocates about the lack of strong job protections in the gig economy, where people work job to job with little security and few employment rights. While location-based gig services such as Uber, Lyft and TaskRabbit require labor like moving and delivery, online gig assignments can be largely done at home. Tasks include image tagging, data entry, website design and software development. For women in the developing world, \u201cthere aren\u2019t enough opportunities and they really struggle to get good quality jobs because of constraints and household responsibilities,\u201d said Namita Datta, lead author of the World Bank report, released Thursday. She said online gig work provides women and underprivileged youth \u201ca very interesting opportunity to participate in the labor market.\u201d Roughly 90% of low-income countries\u2019 workforce is in the informal sector, according to the report. Worker advocates stress the precariousness of gig work and the lack of job security, accountability from management and other social protections to workers' health and retirement. \u201cThe economic conditions in developing countries are different from the U.S., but one thing that is universal is the importance of developing and prioritizing good jobs \u2014 with a basic minimum wage and basic labor standards,\" said Sharon Block, executive director of Harvard Law School\u2019s Center for Labor and a Just Economy. \u201dThere might be different pathways and timelines of getting there, but that's a universal value.\u201d The report outlines how social insurance coverage is low among gig workers globally. Roughly half of the surveyed gig workers did not have a retirement plan and as much as 73% of Venezuelan gig workers and 75% of Nigerians did not have any savings for retirement. Lindsey Cameron, a management professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said \u201cbecause there are so few options available to workers in these developing nations,\u201d online gigs \u2014 with or without social protections \u2014 were better than no job options for many workers. \u201cAnd since workers are economically dependent on this work, and they don\u2019t have any sort of basic protections, that\u2019s what is ultimately exploitive. The odds are always in the platform\u2019s favor, never the workers favor.\u201d In the United States, gig workers, both online and onsite, represent a growing portion of the workforce and there is ongoing contention about worker rights on these platforms. A 2021 Pew Research study, the latest available, shows that 16% of U.S. adults have earned money through an online gig platform, and 30% of 18- to 29-year-olds have done so. Transportation and delivery companies Uber, Lyft, and Grubhub have been entangled in dozens of lawsuits over minimum wage, employment classification and alleged sexual harassment. \u201cRight now, there are too many jobs where workers are misclassified,\u201d Block said. \u201cWhich means many workers are not guaranteed minimum wage, do not have a social safety net, they don't get unemployment, or workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d \u201cNow some states have stepped in to mandate paid leave, but if you don't live in one of those states, you have to play the good boss lottery.\u201d The World Bank report was based on surveys across 17 countries, including Egypt, Argentina, Nigeria, Russia and China.", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 21:15:00", "image_url": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/helenair.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/dd/4dd401a7-e2e1-5ccf-93b0-4e1d2b8ef4d9/64fb4bb5dc7be.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200", "source_id": "helenair", "source_priority": 36771, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "7f3d75b7ec2402e4e690ce0ff2a7487d", "title": "What promoting Bailey Zappe, placing Matt Corral on exempt/left squad means for the Patriots", "link": "https://www.patspulpit.com/2023/9/9/23865674/patriots-bailey-zappe-matt-corral-analysis", "keywords": null, "creator": ["Bernd Buchmasser"], "video_url": null, "description": null, "content": "As opposed to initial reports of the transaction, the New England Patriots have not waived backup quarterback Matt Corral off their 53-man roster. Instead, moving him to the exempt/left squad list opened the door for Bailey Zappe to move onto the active team again. This story below has been updated to reflect that change. The New England Patriots decided to make yet another change at their backup quarterback position. Bailey Zappe was signed to the 53-man roster on the eve of the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles , with Matt Corral getting sent to the exempt/left squad list in a follow-up move. The transaction doesn\u2019t change the head count on the Patriots\u2019 active roster, but it has an impact on the team nonetheless. Let\u2019s analyze what that impact looks like. Bailey Zappe is QB2 after all: Zappe entered his 2023 sophomore campaign as the nominal No. 2 quarterback on the Patriots\u2019 depth chart behind starter Mac Jones. Despite no other QB seriously challenging his standing over the summer, he still was waived ahead of the roster cutdown deadline in late August \u2014 a sign that the team was looking to upgrade the backup position behind Jones. Matt Corral, who was claimed off waivers the next day, appeared to be a possible answer. With Corral now off the team himself, Zappe has returned to the role he held down the stretch in 2022 and throughout this year\u2019s training camp and preseason. Matt Corral is still with the Patriots, sort of: The Patriots were the only team to put in a waiver claim on Corral, picking him up after the Carolina Panthers parted ways with him. Now, he is off New England\u2019s 53-man roster as well, albeit under different circumstances. Why exactly Corral left the team \u2014 he was not spotted during Friday\u2019s practice \u2014 is not known at this time. What we do know, however, is that he technically remains with the Patriots: they will continue holding the rights on the contract they claimed. That means that once/if he returns he would do so in New England. Corral is still getting paid for this week: Even though Corral was moved off the 53-man roster before this week\u2019s game against the Eagles, the NFL-NFLPA Collective Bargaining Agreement ensures that he will still be paid as if on the team on Sunday. This means that he earned 1/18th of his $870,000 base salary, or $48,333. Zappe gets a significant pay increase: Speaking of player compensation, Zappe moving from the practice squad to the active roster will also change his own salary. After being on a $12,000-per-week deal as part of the developmental squad, he will now earn $48,333 for each week spent on New England\u2019s 53-man roster \u2014 an increase of more than 300 percent. New England has three-ish quarterbacks signed now: With Corral no longer part of the equation, the Patriots\u2019 quarterback depth chart is down to Mac Jones and Bailey Zappe. The team does have a third passer on its practice squad, though: Malik Cunningham, who joined the organization as an undrafted rookie free agent earlier this year. While Cunningham had a record-breaking career as a dual-threat quarterback at Louisville, the Patriots opted to use him differently since his arrival. He has seen most of his practice reps and preseason snaps at the wide receiver position. Nonetheless, if push came to show, he would still appear to figure into the quarterback mix to some degree. Both game-day elevation spots remain in play for Sunday: Heading into the weekend, there was a belief that the Patriots might still use Bailey Zappe as their No. 2 behind Mac Jones against the Eagles; Matt Corral\u2019s lack of experience meant that he was no lock to be the only quarterback on the game day roster. To achieve that, the Patriots would have used one of their two standard elevation spots to move Zappe up from the practice squad. With Zappe now instead replacing Corral on the 53-man team, they likely have no need to elevate another passer \u2014 i.e. the aforementioned Malik Cunningham \u2014 for that particular game. As a result, New England still has both spots available. It seems likely that at least one of them will be used on a running back (either Ty Montgomery or Kevin Harris). A spot on the practice squad has opened up: With Zappe headed to the active roster, and Corral to the exempt/left squad list, the Patriots\u2019 roster continues to stand at a full 53. The practice squad, on the other hand, is down to 15 players meaning that one spot is now open. How it will be filled remains to be seen.", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 20:42:00", "image_url": null, "source_id": "patspulpit", "source_priority": 16959, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["sports"], "language": "english"}], "nextPage": "1694292120527716527"}
