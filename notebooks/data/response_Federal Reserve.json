India, this year\u2019s host of the Group of 20 leading rich and developing nations, ended the first day of the summit with what were seen as diplomatic wins despite pointed disagreements among powerful members, particularly over the war in Ukraine. As the first session began, India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the group was adding the African Union as a member \u2014 part of the Indian leader\u2019s drive to uplift the Global South. A few hours later, India announced that it was able to get the disparate group to sign off on a final statement, but only after softening language on the contentious issue of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. It also unveiled an ambitious plan with the United States, the European Union and others to build a rail and shipping corridor linking India with the Middle East and Europe to strengthen economic growth and political cooperation. With those major agenda items taken care of, Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau, Australia\u2019s Anthony Albanese and Japan\u2019s Fumio Kishida, among others, shook hands Sunday and posed for photos with Modi as they arrived at the Rajghat memorial site in New Delhi. Modi gifted the leaders shawls made of khadi, a handspun fabric that was promoted by Gandhi during India\u2019s independence movement against the British. Some leaders \u2014 including British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and last year\u2019s G20 host President Joko Widodo of Indonesia \u2014 walked to the memorial barefoot in a customary show of respect. Many others, including U.S. President Joe Biden, wore slippers that are routinely offered to visitors as they walked over wet ground spotted with puddles from heavy rain. The leaders stood before wreaths placed around the memorial, which features an eternal flame and was draped with orange and yellow flowers marigold garlands. Notably, the one reserved for Modi identified him as president of \u201cBharat,\u201d an ancient Sanskrit name championed by his Hindu nationalist supporters that has shot to prominence as the summit approached. In the months leading up to the leaders\u2019 summit in New Delhi, India had been unable to find agreement on the wording about Ukraine, with Russia and China objecting even to language that they had agreed to at the 2022 G20 summit in Bali. This year\u2019s final statement, released a day before the formal close of the summit, highlighted the \u201chuman suffering and negative added impacts of the war in Ukraine,\u201d but did not mention Russia\u2019s invasion directly. It cited a United Nations charter, saying \u201call states must refrain from the threat or use of force to seek territorial acquisition against the territorial integrity and sovereignty or political independence of any state. The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible.\u201d By contrast, the Bali declaration cited a U.N. resolution condemning \u201cthe aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine,\u201d and said \u201cmost members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine.\u201d Western leaders \u2014 who have pushed for a stronger rebuke of Russia\u2019s actions in past G20 meetings \u2014 still called the consensus a success, and praised India\u2019s nimble balancing act. If the G20 hadn\u2019t produced a final communique, it would have been the first time and a blow to the group\u2019s prestige. Nazia Hussain, an associate research fellow at Singapore\u2019s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said the statement showed a \u201csoftening of the language on the war in Ukraine.\u201d \u201cHowever, for New Delhi, getting out a joint statement with some reference to Ukraine, or a joint statement at all especially with both the United States and its Western allies as well as China and Russia toughening their stance on the war, is a win.\u201d India had made directing more attention to addressing the needs of the developing world a focus of the summit, and organizers worked hard to keep the summit from being dominated by the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed last year\u2019s G20 summit in Bali by video and stole the show with an in-person appearance at the gathering of leaders of the G7 rich democracies\u2014 all of whom are members of the G20 \u2014 in Hiroshima earlier this year. Modi made a point of not inviting Zelenskyy to participate in this year\u2019s event, though it is impossible to decouple many issues, such as food and energy security, from the war in Ukraine. Scholz told reporters it was significant that Russia had signed on to the agreement that mentioned the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Russian negotiator Svetlana Lukash described the discussions on the Ukraine-related part of the final statement as \u201cvery difficult,\u201d adding that the agreed text had a \u201cbalanced view\u201d of the situation, Russian media reported. The G20 includes Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the U.S and the EU. Spain holds a permanent guest seat. \u2014 Associated Press writer David Rising contributed to this report.", "pubDate": "2023-09-10 04:29:42", "image_url": "https://www.wsav.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/75/2023/09/64fd471fab8fa6.91577470.jpeg?w=900", "source_id": "wsav", "source_priority": 20098, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["world"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "7d1e5e9a7f1d0851eaeb6130267dffb8", "title": "World Leaders Offer Solidarity After Devastating Morocco Quake", "link": "https://www.ibtimes.com/world-leaders-offer-solidarity-after-devastating-morocco-quake-3711259", "keywords": null, "creator": null, "video_url": null, "description": "Leaders and diplomats the world over expressed condolences and offered their support for Morocco Saturday after a devastating earthquake struck the mountains southwest of Marrakesh.", "content": "NEWSLETTER SIGNUP My account Log Out Sep 09, 8:00 PM EDT Business Technology World National Politics Media & Culture Opinion Sports Social Capital Crypto NEWSLETTER My account Log Out US Edition Business Technology World National Politics Media & Culture Opinion Sports Social Capital Crypto Listings & More Spotlight Glossary Editions Australia Edition India Edition International Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States NEWSLETTER Follow Us Editions Australia Edition India Edition International Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States World World Leaders Offer Solidarity After Devastating Morocco Quake By AFP News 09/09/23 AT 3:57 PM EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Flipboard The quake hit a mountain region late at night when most people were in their homes AFP Leaders and diplomats the world over expressed condolences and offered their support for Morocco Saturday after a devastating earthquake struck the mountains southwest of Marrakesh. The 6.8-magnitude earthquake that hit late Friday killed more than 1,300 people and injured more than 1,800 more, many of them critically, according to Moroccan authorities. Support has poured in from leaders across the world. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, of Morocco's cross-strait neighbour Spain, expressed his \"solidarity and support to the people of Morocco in the wake of this terrible earthquake... Spain is with the victims of this tragedy\". German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said \"our thoughts are with the victims of this devastating earthquake. Our sympathy goes out to all those affected\". French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \"devastated\" and said that \"France stands ready to help with first aid\". The pope expressed his \"profound solidarity\" with Morocco after the quake, according to the Vatican. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni underlined \"Italy's willingness to support Morocco in this emergency\". European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed sympathy \"with the Moroccan people in the face of the terrible earthquake\". And the European Union member countries, through the European Council said in a statement: \"We are deeply saddened by the devastating consequences of this tragic event... \"As close friends and partners of Morocco, we are ready to assist in any way You may deem useful,\" said the statement, addressed to King Mohammed. The leaders of both Russia and Ukraine also offered their sympathies. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed his \"deepest condolences to HM King Mohammed VI and all Moroccans for the lives lost in the horrible earthquake\". \"Ukraine stands in solidarity with Morocco during this tragic time,\" he said on social media. Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed similar sentiments and said, in a message to Morocco's king, \"we share the pain and the mourning of the friendly Moroccan people\". Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is hosting the G20 summit this weekend, said he was \"extremely pained by the loss of lives due to an earthquake in Morocco\". Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered support to \"our Moroccan brothers in every way in this difficult hour\". Algeria, which broke off diplomatic relations with Morocco in August 2021 at the height of the crisis between the two countries, offered \"its sincere condolences to the brotherly Moroccan people for the victims of the earthquake\", said its foreign ministry. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"instructed all government bodies and forces to provide any necessary assistance to the people of Morocco, including the preparations for sending an aid delegation to the area\", his office said. It is the latest show of support in the wake of the 2020 Abraham Accords that saw Israel normalise ties with a number of Arab countries, including Morocco. The president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, said we \"stand with the Kingdom of Morocco during this difficult time and wish a speedy recovery ahead to all those affected\". He also ordered an \"air bridge to deliver critical relief\" to the country, state news agency WAM reported. Iran expressed its condolences for the \"terrible earthquake\". Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said he was \"ready to provide any form of assistance to deal with the repercussions of the devastating earthquake\". King of Jordan Abdullah II urged his government to provide all possible assistance to Morocco. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu extended his heartfelt condolences to King Mohammed VI of Morocco: \"In the face of this adversity, Nigeria will continue to stand in solidarity with Morocco as they recover, rebuild and come out stronger than ever from this unfortunate event.\" The head of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, expressed his \"sincere condolences\" to the king, the Moroccan people and the families of the victims. The secretary-general of the Jeddah-based Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Hissein Brahim Taha, prayed for \"mercy on the victims and a speedy recovery for the injured\". World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described the quake as \"heartbreaking\", adding: \"We stand ready to support the immediate health needs.\" UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said he was \"deeply saddened by news of the quake, saying \"our thoughts are with the thousands of families affected. We stand ready to support.\" The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said the response to the devastating quake could take years. UNESCO, the UN heritage organisation, said it would help Morocco draw up an inventory of damage to national heritage sites and a repair strategy. \u00a9 Copyright AFP 2023. All rights reserved.

The operation began at 3.28 p.m. local time (8.28 a.m. ET) on Saturday, according to Turkey's Caving Federation - a week after Dickey first became ill during an exploration mission. \"Mark's transport in a stretcher has started at 15:28 local time (GMT+3),\" Turkey's Caving Federation wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Bulent Genc, head of the caving federation, told CNN Thursday that the rescue could take days due to the fact that the cave is deep and narrow, but some experts say it could take up to two weeks. Dickey fell ill at the weekend with suspected gastrointestinal bleeding during a mission of the 1,276 meters-deep (4,186 feet) Morca Sinkhole in Morca Valley, near Anamur, southern Turkey, according to the Turkish Caving Federation. The European Cave Rescue Association (ECRA) received a call on September 2 saying that Dickey was suffering from severe gastric pain, and the next day it was reported that help from outside was needed because of his \"rising destabilization.\" His condition has since stabilized, according to the Turkish Caving Federation. Nearly 200 rescuers are on site working to get Dickey out, said Recep Salci of Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD), including dozens of people who are working inside the cave. \"Some parts of the cave are very narrow, so this will be a tough operation,\" Salci said, adding that a stretcher will be used to assist Dickey out of the cave. Doctors had been working on improving Dickey's health so that the \"difficult\" ascent to the surface can begin \"without further complications,\" the ECRA said Friday, noting that \"rescue teams are preparing the way out to the entrance by installing additional ropes and fixings.\" The operation plans to divide the cave into seven parts and assign responsibility to the rescue teams of different countries at various depths, the ECRA said. Turkish, Hungarian, Polish, Italian, Croatian and Bulgarian teams are all involved in the rescue. Dickey became ill and was placed under observation at the cave base camp, the federation said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. A doctor is with Dickey in the cave, and the rescue team is receiving instant messages from them through an established communications line. In a video shared by Turkey's directorate of communications on Wednesday, Dickey said that although he was \"very close to the edge,\" a quick response by Turkish authorities likely saved his life. \"As you can see I'm up, I'm alert, I'm talking. But I'm not healed on the inside yet so I'm going to need a lot of help to get out of here,\" he said, praising the caving community. \"This is often in the caving world, a great opportunity to show just how well the international world can work together. So I'm hoping to see many people from many countries all coming together. We take care of our own. And it's really special to be taken care of.\" The rescue operation, which was first announced on Monday, could take days due to the fact that the cave is deep and narrow, Bulent Genc, head of the federation, told CNN Thursday, adding that it can take 15 hours for an experienced caver to reach the surface in ideal conditions. A rescue mission at this depth is \"very rare, extremely difficult\" and needs \"many very experienced cave rescuers,\" according to the ECRA, which is involved in the operation. Gretchen Baker, from National Cave Rescue Commission (NCRC), who has known and worked with Dickey for several years and has been in communication with the rescue team, expressed cautious optimism about Dickey's safe passage out of the cave. In an interview with CNN's Isa Soares on Thursday, Baker said \"the team on the ground is very happy that Mark's condition seems to be improving, so that it looks like that he will not have to be in a [ rescue ] litter the entire way out.\" \"The more he can help, the faster the rescue can go,\" she said. Despite Dickey's improving medical situation, Baker said even with him helping, the rescue operation still has some way to go. \"We're anticipating that it will take days to get him out of the cave,\" she said.

But buyers considering an electric vehicle have their own concerns, which can range from access to charging stations to real-world driving range to the time required for EV charging. And then there\u2019s the big question: What is the lifespan of these EV battery packs, and how much does battery replacement cost? Tesla, the most successful electric vehicle company in the world, has done its best to address these concerns. The automaker built an extensive Tesla supercharger network of more than 35,000 fast charging stations, making coast-to-coast road trips a real-world option for road warriors. Tesla owners can also purchase the Tesla Wall Connector charger for between $750 and $1,500, for recharging their vehicle at home. Tesla vehicles provide some of the largest battery sizes available in an EV, with the Tesla Model S rated at up to 405 miles of range from its 105 kilowatt hour battery capacity. That same battery can be charged at a supercharger station at the rate of 200 miles in 15 minutes, though like all lithium-ion batteries, Tesla car batteries charge faster below 80%, then slow as they reach a full charge. This process of battery management during charging helps prolong the battery\u2019s lifespan. Home charging with the Wall Connector will be slower, adding between 10 miles and 44 miles per hour of charge, depending on the house\u2019s circuit breakers and output capacity. Here\u2019s a look at every Tesla model, along with its maximum battery range and MSRP: Many consumers don\u2019t know this, but every EV battery, from the 150-mile Nissan Leaf to the 520-mile Lucid Air, comes with an 8-year/100,000-mile warranty as required by federal law. California requires an even lengthier 10-year/150,000-mile warranty for electric car batteries. Given how many EVs are sold in California, you can safely assume every new battery powering an electric vehicle is engineered to meet California\u2019s requirement, even if it\u2019s sold in another state. Better still, Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s CEO, claims every new Tesla battery should last between 300,000 and 500,000 miles. The U.S. Department of Energy uses 15,000 miles a year as its assumed standard range of annual driving for consumers, which would put Tesla\u2019s battery life at between 20 and 33 years. Assuming a single charge a day, that timeframe would involve between 7,300 and 12,045 charge cycles. Is Tesla\u2019s battery technology really robust enough to handle that type of long-term use without a substantial loss in energy storage, and an associated drop in driving range? Because Tesla hasn\u2019t been selling cars for 20 years, yet, there\u2019s no way to test Elon\u2019s claim. But with over 3 million Teslas sold so far there have been relatively few reports of battery modules failing. And as noted above, if serious battery degradation does occur, it will likely be covered under a warranty. However, in the rare case a Tesla battery fails and isn\u2019t covered, it\u2019s reasonable to assume a replacement cost of between $10,000 and $20,000. Bottom line, an electric car\u2019s battery life shouldn\u2019t be a concern for consumers looking to buy a new \u2013 or even used \u2013 EV. This includes new and used Tesla models, which are unlikely to experience battery failure, and will probably be under warranty if they do. Of course you\u2019ll want to check the current mileage and vehicle history of any used EV you\u2019re looking to buy to ensure a battery warranty is in place and no past incidents (i.e. major accident, flood damage) have occurred that might have damaged the battery pack.

About High-Yield Accounts High-yield savings accounts aren't the only accounts paying favorable rates right now. You'll typically see the highest rates at online or lower-profile institutions rather than national brands with a significant brick and mortar presence. This is normal; online banks have lower overhead cost and are willing to pay high rates to attract new customers. High-Yield Savings Accounts The best high-yield savings accounts provide the security of a savings account with the added bonus of a high APY. Savings accounts are held at a bank or credit union \u2014 not invested through a brokerage account \u2014 and are best for saving cash in pursuit of shorter-term goals, like a vacation or big purchase. High-Yield Checking Accounts The best high-yield checking accounts tend to pay slightly lower rates than high-yield savings, but even they are strong in today's rate environment. A checking account is like a hub for your money: If your paycheck is direct deposited, it's typically to a checking account. If you transfer money to pay a bill, you typically do it from a checking account. Checking accounts are used for everyday spending and usually come with checks and/or debit cards to make that easy. Money Market Accounts The best money market accounts could be considered a middle ground between checking and savings: They are used for saving money but typically provide easy access to your account through checks or a debit card. They usually offer a tiered interest rate depending on your balance. Cash Management Accounts A cash management account is also like a savings/checking hybrid. You'll generally see them offered by online banks, and, unlike a checking account, they usually offer unlimited transfers. A savings account often limits the number of monthly transfers, while a checking account doesn't. Cash management accounts typically come with a debit card for easy access, but you may have to pay a fee if you want to deposit cash. Certificates of Deposit The best CD rates may outpace any of the other accounts we've described above. That's because a certificate of deposit requires you to \"lock in\" your money for a predetermined amount of time ranging from three months to five years. To retrieve it before then, you'll pay a penalty (unless you opt for one of the best no-penalty CDs ). The longer you'll let the bank hold your money, the higher rate you'll get. CD rates aren't variable; the rate you get upon depositing your money is the rate you'll get for the length of your term. About CD Terms Locking your money into an account in exchange for a higher interest rate can be a big decision. Here's what you need to know about common CD terms. No-Penalty CDs Most CDs charge you a fee if you need to withdraw money from your account before the term ends. But with a no-penalty CD, you won't have to pay an early withdrawal penalty. The best no-penalty CDs will offer rates slightly higher than the best high-yield savings accounts , and can offer a substantially improved interest rate over traditional brick-and-mortar savings accounts. 6-Month CDs The best 6-month CDs are offering interest rates in the mid-5% range. Six-month CDs are best for those who are looking for elevated rates on their savings for short-term gains, but are uncomfortable having limited access to their cash in the long term. These can be a good option for those who may just be getting started with saving, or who don't have a large emergency fund for unexpected expenses. 1-Year CDs The best 1-year CDs tend to offer some of the top CD rates, and are a popular option for many investors. A 1-year term can be an attractive option for someone building a CD ladder , or for someone who has a reasonable cash safety net but is still concerned about long-term expenses. 2-Year CDs The best 2-year CD rates will be slightly lower than 1-year and no-penalty CD rates. In exchange for a longer lock-in period, investors receive a long-term commitment for a specific rate. These are best used as part of a CD ladder strategy, or for those worried about a declining rate market in the foreseeable future. 3-Year CDs The best 3-year CDs tend to have rates that are comparable to 2-year CDs. These are usually less popular for your average investor, but can be an important lever when diversifying investments and hedging against the risk of unfavorable rate markets in the long term. 5-Year CDs The best 5-year CDs will offer lower rates than the other terms on our list, but are still popular options for investors. These CDs are best for those looking to lock in high rates for the long term. CDs are generally viewed as safe investment vehicles, and securing a favorable rate can yield considerable earnings in year three and beyond \u2014 even if rates fall elsewhere.

The lawsuit \u2014 filed in 2021 by Dream Key pass holder Jenale Nielsen \u2014 alleged Disney had advertised that that particular pass, its most expensive offer, would not have any blackout dates. Upon buying the $1,399 annual pass in September 2021, a month after Disney remodeled its annual pass program under the Magic Key moniker, Nielsen found she was not able to reserve a ticket for much of November, despite single- and multi-day tickets still being available for the time period. She soon discovered additional restrictions, according to the lawsuit. An agreement to settle the suit was initially announced, without specifics, in July. The preliminary agreement unveiled Friday covers 103,435 Dream Key pass holders, all of whom will be automatically enrolled to receive a disbursement from the $9.5-million fund unless they request to be excluded. The total amount to be disbursed will be determined after several deductions, including attorneys\u2019 fees for both parties, a service award for Nielsen and an estimated $147,547 in administrative costs for the settlement administrator. The preliminary agreement estimates each class member will receive about $67.41, though there could be a second round of payments depending on how much remains after initial distribution and fees. \u201cWe are satisfied that this matter has been resolved,\u201d Disney officials said in an email statement to The Times in July. Attorneys for Nielsen did not immediately reply to a request for comment Friday. The settlement is due to be finalized in federal court on Oct. 7.
