In fact, there were a reported 13 tornadoes in New York state in one day on May 31, 1998, according to . To this day, that holds the record for most tornado activity in recorded state history But we've had quite other active days for severe weather, including more recent years. A storm system in early August 2023 spawned six tornadoes across the area, in almost a decade. But how likely are you getting struck by a tornado while living in New York? Where in New York are tornadoes most prevalent? The website used data from to find the counties in New York that have experienced the most tornadoes since 2000. While tornadoes have been recorded for years before tha by meteorologists, forecast accuracy has greatly increased since the 1990s, according to There have been three recorded F4s that have touched down in New York state, according to . The first happened on August 28, 1973 in Columbia County over mostly open land, before moving into Massachusetts. Another F4 first touched down near Erie, Pennsylvania May 31, 1985, and then moved over the state line into New York. This was part of deadly outbreak of tornadoes that hit NY, PA, OH, and Ontario that same day. The third was a nearly mile-wide tornado that touched down in Montgomery County on July 10, 1989. The storm would stay on the ground for 42 miles, traveling four counties (Greene, Montgomery, Schoharie, and Albany Counties). You also have to consider that many of these weather records generally only go back to the late 1800s, so there is no telling how many storms hit before those times.", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 23:00:01", "image_url": "https://townsquare.media/site/705/files/2023/09/attachment-GettyImages-534166682.jpg", "source_id": "nj1015", "source_priority": 9819, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "52a490538165816d4e6c495251ac3ac9", "title": "Race to find survivors as Morocco earthquake toll passes 2,000", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/9/race-to-find-survivors-as-morocco-earthquake-toll-passes-1300?traffic_source=rss", "keywords": ["News"], "creator": null, "video_url": null, "description": "The magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit remote High Atlas mountain region, killing 2,012 people and leaving many homeless.", "content": "Rescuers searching for survivors dug through the rubble of collapsed houses in remote mountain villages of Morocco on Saturday, as armed forces were pressed into action in the wake of the country\u2019s deadliest earthquake in more than 60 years. Authorities declared three days of national mourning after the magnitude 6.8 earthquake killed more than 2,012 people and injured 2,059, with many left homeless. Morocco\u2019s King Mohammed VI ordered the armed forces to mobilise specialised search and rescue teams and a surgical field hospital, according to a statement from the military. The quake that struck in Morocco\u2019s High Atlas mountains late on Friday night damaged historic buildings in Marrakesh \u2013 the nearest city to the epicentre \u2013 while most of the fatalities were reported in mountainous areas to the south in the Al-Haouz and Taroudant provinces. In the mountain village of Tafeghaghte near the quake\u2019s epicentre, virtually no buildings were left standing. The traditional clay bricks used by the region\u2019s Berber inhabitants proved no match for the rare quake. \u201cThree of my grandchildren and their mother were killed \u2013 they are still under the rubble,\u201d villager Omar Benhanna, 72, told AFP. \u201cJust a while ago, we were all playing together.\u201d The epicentre of the earthquake was at a depth of 18.5km (11.5 miles) and occurred about 72km (44 miles) northeast of Marrakesh, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said. Lahcen Haddad, a Moroccan senator and former minister, says the authorities are responding quickly despite the many challenges, including difficult terrain. \u201cMoroccan authorities are \u2026 getting people to hospitals in Marrakesh. There has been a call to give blood. After the Al Hoceima earthquake in 2004, [authorities] put together a mega plan for a rapid intervention,\u201d he told Al Jazeera. In historic Marrakesh, people could be seen on state TV clustering in the streets, afraid to go back inside buildings that might still be unstable. The city\u2019s famous Koutoubia Mosque, built in the 12th century, was damaged but the extent was not immediately clear. Its 69-metre (226-foot) minaret is known as the \u201croof of Marrakesh\u201d. Moroccans also posted videos showing damage to parts of the famous red walls that surround the old city, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The Royal Moroccan Football Federation announced that a Cup of African Nations qualifier against Liberia, due to have been played on Saturday in the coastal city of Agadir, had been postponed indefinitely. The Red Cross said it was mobilising resources to support the Moroccan Red Crescent but its Middle East and North Africa director, Hossam Elsharkawi, warned: \u201cWe are looking at many months if not years of response.\u201d The Moroccan armed forces will deploy rescue teams to provide affected areas with clean drinking water, food supplies, tents and blankets, authorities said. In the village of Amizmiz, near the epicentre, rescue workers picked through rubble with their bare hands. Outside a hospital, about 10 bodies lay covered in blankets as grieving relatives stood nearby. \u201cWhen I felt the earth shaking beneath my feet and the house leaning, I rushed to get my kids out. But my neighbours couldn\u2019t,\u201d Mohamed Azaw told Reuters news agency. \u201cUnfortunately, no one was found alive in that family. The father and son were found dead and they are still looking for the mother and the daughter.\u201d Rescuers stood atop the pancaked floors of one building in Amizmiz, about 55km (34 miles) south of Marrakesh, bits of carpet and furniture protruding from the rubble. A long queue formed outside the only open shop as people sought supplies. Underlining the challenges facing rescuers, fallen boulders blocked a road from Amizmiz to a nearby village. Journalist Younis Ezzouhir told Al Jazeera from Marrakesh that efforts are continuing to clear roads to get to more survivors in affected areas in al-Haouz province, especially the small town of Talat N\u2019Yaaqoub and rural commune there. \u201cThis road faced landslides. It is a mountain road but the nature of the road is that the ground is mud soil, so it is fragile, and with rainfall or earthquakes there can be major amount of dirt and stones falling from the mountains,\u201d Ezzouhir said. Tremors were felt as far away as Huelva and Jaen in southern Spain. The World Health Organization said more than 300,000 people were affected in Marrakesh and surrounding areas. As news emerged of Morocco\u2019s unfolding earthquake disaster, reactions poured in from the international community. Turkey, where powerful earthquakes in February killed more than 50,000 people, was among nations expressing solidarity and offering support. Algeria, which broke off ties with Morocco in 2021 after escalating tensions between the countries focused on the Western Sahara conflict, said it would open its airspace for humanitarian and medical flights. Despite an outpouring of offers of help from around the world, the Moroccan government has not formally asked for assistance, a step required before outside rescue crews could deploy. The quake was recorded at a depth of 18.5km, typically more destructive than deeper quakes of the same magnitude. It was Morocco\u2019s deadliest earthquake since 1960 when a quake was estimated to have killed at least 12,000 people, according to the US Geological Survey.", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 21:24:48", "image_url": null, "source_id": "aljazeera_us", "source_priority": 543, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "2f0bf51c26ea5abd82365b9b794115d6", "title": "Mother, Couch! review \u2013 a first-rate cast gets lost in a second-rate muddle", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/sep/09/mother-couch-review-a-first-rate-cast-gets-lost-in-a-second-rate-muddle", "keywords": ["Toronto film festival 2023", "Toronto film festival", "Festivals", "Culture", "Film", "Ewan McGregor", "Ellen Burstyn", "Drama films", "Comedy films", "Comedy"], "creator": ["Benjamin Lee in Toronto"], "video_url": null, "description": "Excellent performances from Ewan McGregor, Ellen Burstyn, Rhys Ifans and Lara Flynn Boyle are wasted on a baffling, surreal family indieHeads will be left thoroughly scratched by this rather bewildering curio, a rambling yet not entirely ineffectual comedy-drama about a fractured family forced together by unusual circumstance, starting out somewhat of this world before falling headfirst into surrealist fantasy.

We\u2019re attached for the entirety to McGregor\u2019s put-upon problem-solver, the youngest son lumped with the responsibilities that his more wayward siblings refuse to confront, a peacekeeper growing tired of his role, helping a parent who never really helped him while also becoming a parent of potentially similar incompetence. It\u2019s his finest work for a while, the actor often blandly miscast in films that smooth down the edges that made him famous, and he tries hard, at times exhaustingly so, to add texture to a character with very little, attempting to fire up an emotional core that never really sparks (in a merciful twist, especially for McGregor, the film is accent-free, each of the three children speaking in their natural dialect). It\u2019s all one long stress dream for him and for us, the film flirting with flashes of horror as sound design and brief moments of violence that keep things uncomfortably tense, and with Burstyn\u2019s psyche disintegrating, there are scenes that recall her Requiem for a Dream breakdown, albeit with a softer touch. Larsson\u2019s skill as a director increasingly outpaces his ability as a writer and the film is visually involving even when it\u2019s narratively alienating (if nothing else, it\u2019s a remarkably assured sizzle reel for Larsson, film-maker, one that feels prepped to be mailed straight to the A24 offices). His actors remain so very committed throughout, even as the film revels in maddening incoherence, that you\u2019re tempted to believe in whatever it is they\u2019re apparently seeing. It\u2019s especially rewarding to see Boyle return in her most notable role for years, chain-smoking and barking through the chaos, convincing us that there might be a late-stage career switch to character actor for the one-time leading lady. She\u2019s so good that it\u2019s then frustrating to see her sidelined, a big introduction that fades into nothing, one of too many thinly written characters left stranded as the film descends into a nonsensically twee finale. It\u2019s all a bit of a hopeless muddle dragged to the finish line by a troupe of impressively hopeful actors giving us brief bursts of electricity, almost insisting that we stay put, but unlike Burstyn\u2019s stubborn mother you\u2019ll be itching to be somewhere, anywhere else.

They get lost and rained on, reaching the bottom physically and metaphorically before an impersonate speech by Jack ( Martin Henderson ) at the top wins Mel ( Alexandra Breckenridge ) back.

Netflix Another new couple alert, Cameron and Muriel, make if official, getting permission from Doc and going public at the Labor Day Carnival, the latest in a long list of Virgin River community events featured as backdrop to major episodes on the show. Preacher and Kaia also are going from strength to strength until she gets a call that the fire clean-up has uncovered a mystery buried body, which stops Preacher in his tracks as he was the one who put that body into the ground to help Paige. After Jack and Mel get on the same page about starting a family even if not in the way they originally had envisioned, Mel takes him to Lilly\u2019s burned-down farm where part of the charred tree is still standing with the swing where the two had a sweet chat in Season 1 miraculously intact. She wants them to buy the plot of land and build their dream house to raise a family and he loves the idea. The reason why the duo needs a new property is that Jack\u2019s existing one has been temporarily seized by the FBI. The final two episodes wrapped the glamping drug scheme plot line, with Jack catching Brady (Benjamin Hollingsworth) cooking the books moments before Brady gets abducted by Melissa Montgomery\u2019s goons.

Mikita also explains the use of flashbacks in the two episodes, shares how crew members stepped in twice to serve as background performers, reveals whether Mel and Jack really go back to Lilly\u2019s farm and other behind-the-scenes details. (For a deep dive into the wildfire-themed Episodes 505 and 506, read our interview .) DEADLINE: What were the biggest challenges filming Jack and Mel\u2019s hike to Angel\u2019s Peak? MIKITA : One of the challenges certainly from a directorial standpoint, coming right from the wake of the episodes involving the fire , we had to demonstrate some areas of post-fire destruction. We had to create a bit of an aftermath and then enhance that with visual effects because you wanted it to feel the devastation of what they just experienced and with their own personal turmoil that they were both going through, with Jack really trying to reach out to Mel to try to get through to her because she had been quite distant from the end of Episode 8 and into 9. He had to coax her into going out to have a little bit of a soul-searching walk together where they could clear their minds and discuss what\u2019s happened and what the future has for them. We were checker-boarding their conversation through the rest of the episode as they are getting deeper into the forest and ultimately reach Angel\u2019s Peak, which is a beautiful mountain location in Squamish, a spectacular vista. There were some production challenges getting the crew and the equipment and everything up to that spot. The journey itself, we\u2019d broken it up into four different locations, three of which we used the same vicinity but created different environments, and the way that those things were shot, I tried to give a lot of space if that makes sense, lots of wide shots to show almost the insignificance of them as individuals in the grand scheme of the environments with those nice big, epic wide shots combined with tight, closeups for the emotional impacts of the scenes. At one point, again from a technical standpoint, a rain storm hits when they get lost. We had to generate rain so we had to bring in rain towers and approach that one pretty carefully because once they get wet, they\u2019re wet. We were not in a position to be able to send them back to the trailers to get changed and dried off again, should something go wrong, so we had to be pretty careful with our approach to that but Alex and Martin are so great and such a pleasure to work with, they made it easy and fun. DEADLINE: I assume the rain scene was shot in one take? MIKITA : That\u2019s right. We had to get the rain essentially in one take so we did all our rehearsals very, very carefully and camera placements. Once the rain came down, I don\u2019t think Alex was expecting it to come down as fast and hard as it did so she started to laugh but used that in context of the scene, the absurdity of the situation of being washed up in the forest \u2014 What more could happen?! And then the rain starts. Once she started laughing, she used that because she knew, oh I need to stay in character, that was pretty fun. DEADLINE: So the laugh was not scripted? MIKITA : It wasn\u2019t no, no, it was just her take on it. We kind of knew that it was coming; the anticipation of having these big rain towers overhead, everybody with their finger on the button. So she was anticipating it but it\u2019s never what you expected. DEADLINE: A kiss in the rain is a hallmark of a romantic movie. You had not one but two in the Angel\u2019s Peak montage, between an established couple, Mel and Jack, and a brand new one, Brie and Mike. How did that juxtaposition come about? MIKITA : That I have to give full credit to [writer] Ildiko [Susany], she had created the sequence in the structure of the script such that we could have those concurrent moments. With Brie and Mike, they are having a baseball game, which was a lot of fun in itself because neither of them \u2014 well, Marco plays a little bit of baseball but the extras that showed up couldn\u2019t really play baseball. So we ended up having to get some of our key crew members in on it. DEADLINE: So some of those players on the field are actually crew members? MIKITA : Yeah, there\u2019s a few of them. Our production manager, Neil [Williams], was in there, I threw him into the game. And there\u2019s a couple of other crew members as well; I had to bring them in to make it look a little bit more realistic. And it worked out fine because it was created as a montage, so it wasn\u2019t like they had to sustain long shots. But thank goodness for the crew members that stepped up and helped out with that sequence. That\u2019s so indicative of everybody on Virgin River . It\u2019s such a great family, the crew and the cast, everybody really enjoys coming to work. DEADLINE: To wrap up Mel and Jack\u2019s hike, can you share your experience filming Jack\u2019s emotional \u201cI was lost, I was broken\u201d speech on Angel\u2019s Peak? MIKITA : Well, the two of them are so great together and they work so well together and support one another, both as friends off-camera and supporting one another on camera. It was obviously a big moment for Jack and for Martin as the actor to be able to articulate it in a not too melodramatic way. Martin is very self-aware, and he\u2019s always very, very concerned that he\u2019s not being disingenuous and has been truthful. The way that he had that on the day was just to stay really relaxed and having fun, drinking tea. His partner was there visiting from New Zealand at the time as well which really kept him at ease because she\u2019s such a wonderful person. There is a lot of friendships and camaraderie on this set anyway, and it was very loose and fun. The weather was great. And we were just trying to keep everything really relaxed and didn\u2019t draw too much attention to the scenes themselves ahead of time. We didn\u2019t even really rehearse much \u2014 we ran the lines maybe once \u2014 we wanted it to be spontaneous and real and genuine. Martin was so great, and I think he felt good about it after we had done it because even for a lot of us on-set \u2014 myself and other crew members \u2014 were very affected by his speech because everybody has baggage in their lives and to hear somebody speak from the heart is always something special. DEADLINE: Moving towards Episode 10, there is a change of genres, with a crime caper element involving Jack\u2019s glamping site discovery, Brady\u2019s abduction and the Jack-led rescue operation. It feels like almost a different show within the show. Barbara Pollard as Melissa Montgomery in episode 510. Netflix MIKITA : Yeah, I agree with you completely on that. I feel the same way. It was a real turn of events, the cliffhanger at the end of nine where Jack makes the discovery, catching Brady red-handed. I thought it was a great, very well crafted, well written, ending and cliffhanger for 509 and then to just continue that momentum and build that momentum. It\u2019s like you said it\u2019s like a different genre that now all of a sudden we\u2019re in a heavy crime drama with an action sequence and fighting and gunfire, all sorts of stuff happening, and it\u2019s very unusual for Virgin River . And again, hats off to Martin, to Ben and to everybody that was part of that for being able to slip so effortlessly into what is essentially a whole different format for the show, and it showed us that these guys are good action actors as well. We had some careful fight choreography that we had done ahead of time. To stage the fight sequence in a short amount of time on location, there\u2019s always challenges in doing that, but it all came together really, really well. Obviously, that\u2019s a big moment with Mike being shot and that was the uncertainty of what could potentially happen there and with the guilt that Brady would be feeling as a result of all of this, and the discovery of the drugs, the displacement of the people and all the rest, that was a really brave transition for the writers to take the story there. But at the same time, in the midst of that, we easily move ourselves into a Labor Day carnival, which at first blush when I read it, I felt that might be a bit too abrupt of a transition to go from such a heavy drama, action sequence to a carnival situation, but I thought it would work well. DEADLINE: Well, it\u2019s another hallmark of the show. We\u2019ve had Renaissance Fair, Lumberjack Games, Moonlight Mingle. Every season, there is a big community event. MIKITA : A big community set piece, yeah. And the real challenge with the carnival was, we experienced what\u2019s called an atmospheric river event during the shooting of that carnival. First of all, we were bound by only having access to that carnival rides and everything for a three-day window because it was booked for some other events somewhere so we had to shoot it on those particular three days. We had heavy, heavy, heavy rain throughout the time that we were shooting the carnival, so we had to bring in big construction cranes and build what are called fly swatters, which are basically just big tarps that they could put over top to try to alleviate as much of the rain showing on camera as possible. But it was really difficult to do. Same thing again, back to the crew coming to the rescue. There were several rides, where the extras didn\u2019t want to be going on these rides in the epic rain for extensive periods of time so the crew jumped in and volunteered to be carnival-goers. So, in spite of the horrible weather, we still were able to laugh and have fun and make the best of the situation. DEADLINE: So all the carnival scenes were filmed in rain conditions? I couldn\u2019t tell. MIKITA : Yeah, there were only one or two scenes that were not in full rain, but I\u2019d say 80% of it was in heavy, heavy rain. DEADLINE: Did you consider changing the script to incorporate the rain or was it, we already had plenty of rain in \u2018Angel\u2019s Peak\u2019, no more this season? MIKITA : Yeah, it didn\u2019t track and it didn\u2019t really make sense. I was at the time advocating for it \u2014 we\u2019re in Northern California it does rain, and it exemplifies the resilience of the people of Virgin River that in spite of weather, they\u2019re happy to go out and participate in community events. There was a scene that we did have to change around a little bit; it was one of the first scenes where Lizzie\u2019s doing all the preparation [for the carnival]. I was pretty adamant that they wear appropriate costuming \u2014 wear a raincoat or carry an umbrella because it is really raining, there is no hiding it. After that scene, we had all together decided, let\u2019s make best efforts to try to hide the rain as best we can. And that\u2019s what we did. DEADLINE: There were a few revelations during the carnival, including Charmaine\u2019s encounter with her twins\u2019 father. You also directed the finale last season when the cliffhanger was her telling Jack that he was not the father. When you were filming that, did you know who the father was and did you have any inkling it would be Calvin? MIKITA : I did not. I think I was just as surprised as anybody when that was revealed. I was kind of floored actually because I had no idea at the end of Season 4 that he would be the father, I did not see that coming. We all talk about it, all the crew, we\u2019re always quite anxious to read the scripts when they come out because we\u2019re just like the audience; we\u2019re wondering and curious ourselves as to how are we going to get out of this mess, who is it going to be? DEADLINE: Also immediately after the carnival, Mel takes Jack to the tree with the swing at Lilly\u2019s burned-down farm and they reminiscent about their conversation in the same spot during Season 1, before deciding to buy the land. Did you happen to direct that episode that was used for the flashbacks? MIKITA : Yes, I did direct that. We didn\u2019t go to exactly the same spot, we recreated the aftermath at a different location. For all sorts of logistical reasons, we didn\u2019t go there and because we were going to be there at nighttime and all the burnt aftermath, it wasn\u2019t essential to go back to the same spot even though I wanted to go back to that spot. But, for many production reasons, it didn\u2019t make sense. DEADLINE: What was your reaction when you saw in the script a reference to something that we had pretty much forgotten about coming full circle and footage previously shot being used again? MIKITA : I wondered at first if it made sense for us to use the flashbacks. I didn\u2019t know whether that was necessary from a story perspective at the time when I read it. But I think it made sense to refresh the audience and to make that connection because I think it would have been out of people\u2019s minds. I don\u2019t think they would have recognized or remembered the tree swing. DEADLINE: I didn\u2019t. And speaking of flashbacks, one was used when Preacher hears that a body has been found. Was this also a decision to refresh viewers\u2019 memories and to make it clear we are talking about the same body that Preacher buried? That death was a more recent development than the swing scene, and the flashback felt more on the nose. MIKITA : I thought that also at first, is it a bit too much, a bit too on the nose but I think it was just important to do that. I don\u2019t think that the footage that was used was necessarily from the show, it was footage that was shot but had not aired previously, I believe. (L to R) Teryl Rothery as Muriel St. Claire, Mark Ghanime as Dr. Cameron Hayek in episode 509. Netflix DEADLINE: The last act of the finale provided updates on all of Virgin River \u2018s couples, Mel and Jack, Lizzie and Denny, Doc and Hope, Preacher and Kaia, Brie and Mike and Cameron and Muriel. What was the most surprising couple development for you? It was kind of brave for the writers to pursue a Muriel-Cameron relationship with an age gap rarely seen on television. It is way more common when the gap is in the other direction, with an older man. MIKITA : Well, that was the most surprising for me, because I honestly didn\u2019t see that one coming. Muriel\u2019s character is so outgoing and fun and brave to begin with that, when it did start to surface it was like, oh, yeah, I could see her doing that, I could see her being in a way the instigator in the relationship. First of all as you say, it\u2019s brave on behalf of the writers because of that obvious age gap. But at the same time it makes sense and it\u2019s perfectly acceptable. I felt good about it and enjoyed it and enjoyed the way they played it and how they presented themselves as a couple. For Cameron, he has to be so cautious and a little bit more self aware and self-conscious. At the same time, he says okay, we\u2019re going to the carnival. It\u2019s so much fun to see how everybody else reacts. So that was the fun one for me and perhaps the Brie and Mike development. I didn\u2019t really see that one coming so much. For Brie and Brady, we always knew that was never really going to be something that was going to get onto solid ground. So I think that we saw coming. But Mike I thought that was an interesting one, too. DEADLINE: The Lizzie and Denny scene, in which he tells her that he wants to leave Virgin River but she surprises him with the pregnancy news. How was it filming Denny\u2019s (Kai Bradbury)\u2019s reaction of utter shock? Sarah Dugdale as Lizzie in episode 510. Netflix MIKITA : That was all Kai. He\u2019s a terrific actor, I think he is underrated. I\u2019ve worked with him on another show and saw the depth of his abilities as a performer. There were a lot of distractions for him during that scene \u2014 we had the weather distraction of the rain. The amount of noise generated by the machinery of all the rides that were happening, the extras around them, everything, all the noise from the carnival was difficult, and we had to re-voice a lot of the scenes. That was one of them where he had to do some ADR for that, both of them had to, and Doc and Hope had to re-voice theirs. Hats off to Kai for being able to be in the moment and not be distracted by everything that was going on around him. It\u2019s a testament to his ability as an actor and generally for all of our actors on Virgin River that they can work through all these other distractions and stay focused on their job as actors and stay in character. DEADLINE: And now onto the flash-forward at the end of the finale that teases the two holiday episodes. What was your reaction when you read that scene and the final line about Mel\u2019s real father? MIKITA : I was a bit floored by that. And it became a running joke on set, we were all speculating, everybody is wondering what the answer is. I was literally going through my database of okay, who could it possibly be? I didn\u2019t see it coming. None of us did. But we all wanted to have the answer so we could understand it to give it context when we were shooting the scenes.", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 18:06:35", "image_url": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Virgin_River_n_S5_E9_00_33_58_15R.jpg", "source_id": "deadline", "source_priority": 486, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["entertainment"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "c9566c5df3d7d02bfa7f1f0ac9b65f42", "title": "We know where the next big earthquakes will happen \u2014 but not when", "link": "https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/9/21/16339522/earthquakes-morocco-turkey-syria-explained-science", "keywords": null, "creator": ["Umair Irfan"], "video_url": null, "description": null, "content": "A powerful magnitude Friday night, the largest tremor to hit the country in at least 120 years. Officials report and expect the death toll to rise as rescuers reach remote afflicted areas. Such strong earthquakes are rare in North Africa, which means few structures are designed to withstand them and residents have little experience responding when a quake occurs. But earthquakes can still be deadly in earthquake-prone regions. In February, a huge magnitude early Monday morning. Another quake with a magnitude of 7.7 rocked the region a few hours later. The quakes and toppled more than . Two major fault lines cross the Turkey and trigger shocks on a regular basis. Larger quakes are less frequent, but still a regular occurrence. Last November, Turkey suffered a . A between Turkey and Greece in 2020. While scientists have drastically improved their understanding of where earthquakes are likely to occur, forecasting when one will occur is still impractical. The rumbling earth can easily catch people off-guard, worsening the ensuing death and destruction. In light of the recent disasters, here\u2019s a refresher on earthquakes, along with some of the latest science on measuring and predicting them. 1) What causes earthquakes An earthquake occurs when massive blocks of the earth\u2019s crust . These blocks, called tectonic plates, lie on top of the earth\u2019s mantle, a layer that over millions of years. That means tectonic plates jostle each other over time. They can also slide on top of each other, a phenomenon called subduction. The places on the planet where one plate meets another are the most prone to earthquakes. The specific surfaces where parcels of earth slip past each other are called faults. As plates move, pressure builds up across their boundaries, while friction holds them in place. When the former overwhelms the latter, the earth shakes as the pent-up energy dissipates. Scientists understand these kinds of earthquakes well, which include those stemming from the San Andreas Fault in California and the East Anatolian Fault in Turkey. However, earthquakes can also occur within tectonic plates, as pressure along their edges cause deformations in the middle. These risks are harder to detect and measure. \u201cOur understanding of these within-plate earthquakes is not as good,\u201d said Stanford University geophysics professor Greg Beroza. An earthquake within a tectonic plate has fewer telltale signs than those that occur at fault lines, he added. 2) The Richter scale isn\u2019t the only measurement game in town anymore The Richter scale, developed by Charles Richter in 1935 to measure quakes in Southern California, has fallen out of fashion. It uses a logarithmic scale, rather than a linear scale, to account for the fact that there is such a huge difference between the tiniest tremors and tower-toppling temblors. On a logarithmic scale, a magnitude 7 earthquake is 10 times more intense than a magnitude 6 and 100 times more intense than a magnitude 5. The Richter scale is actually measuring the peak amplitude of seismic waves, making it an indirect estimate of the earthquake itself. So if an earthquake is like a rock dropped in a pond, the Richter scale is measuring the height of the largest wave, not the size of the rock nor the extent of the ripples. And in the case of an earthquake, the ripples aren\u2019t traveling through a homogenous medium like water, but through solid rock that comes in different shapes, sizes, densities, and arrangements. Solid rock also supports multiple kinds of waves. (Some geologic structures can dampen big earthquakes while others can amplify lesser tremors.) While Richter\u2019s scale, calibrated to Southern California, was useful to compare earthquakes at the time, it provides an incomplete picture of risks and loses accuracy for stronger events. It also misses some of the nuances of other earthquake-prone regions in the world, and it isn\u2019t all that useful for people trying to build structures to withstand them. \u201cWe can\u2019t use that in our design calculations,\u201d said Steven McCabe, leader of the earthquake engineering group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. \u201cWe deal in displacements.\u201d Displacement, or how much the ground actually moves, is one alternative way to describe earthquakes. Another is the moment magnitude scale. It accounts for multiple types of seismic waves, drawing on more precise instruments and better computing to provide a reliable measuring stick to compare seismic events. When you hear about an earthquake\u2019s magnitude in the news \u2014 like Turkey\u2019s recent magnitude 7.8 quake \u2014 moment magnitude is usually the scale being used. But this is still a proxy for the size of the earthquake. And with only indirect measurements, it can take up to a year to decipher the scale of an event, like the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, said Marine Denolle, an earthquake researcher at Harvard University. \u201cWe prefer to use peak ground acceleration,\u201d she said. This is a metric that measures how the speed and direction of the ground changes and has proven the most useful for engineers. So, yes, earthquake scales have gotten a lot more complicated and specific over time. But that\u2019s also helped scientists and engineers take much more precise measurements \u2014 which makes a big difference in planning for them. 3) We can\u2019t really anticipate them all that well Predicting earthquakes is a touchy issue for scientists, in part because it has long been a game of who claim to be able to forecast earthquakes. (Their declarations have, of course, .) Scientists do have a good sense of earthquakes could happen. Using historical records and geologic measurements, they can highlight potential seismic hot spots and the kinds of tremors they face. (You can check out the of fault lines and of seismic events.) As for quakes will hit, that\u2019s still murky. \u201cLots of seismologists have worked on that problem for many decades. We\u2019re not predicting earthquakes in the short term,\u201d said Beroza. \u201cThat requires us to know all kinds of information we don\u2019t have.\u201d It\u2019s difficult to figure out when an earthquake will occur, since the forces that cause them happen slowly over a vast area but are dispersed rapidly over a narrow region. What\u2019s amazing is that forces built up across continents over millions of years can hammer cities in minutes. Forecasting earthquakes would require high-resolution measurements deep underground over the course of decades, if not longer, coupled with sophisticated simulations. And even then, it\u2019s unlikely to yield an hour\u2019s worth of lead time. So there are ultimately too many variables at play and too few tools to analyze them in a meaningful way. Some research shows that foreshocks can precede a larger earthquake, but it\u2019s difficult to distinguish them from the hundreds of smaller earthquakes that occur on a regular basis. On shorter time scales, can actually race ahead of seismic waves. In the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan, for example, warnings from near the epicenter reached Tokyo 232 miles away, buying residents about a minute of warning time. Many countries are now setting up to harness modern electronic communications to detect tremors and transmit alerts ahead of shaking ground, buying a few precious minutes to seek shelter. Meanwhile, after a large earthquake, aftershocks often rock the afflicted region. \u201cIf we just had a big one, we know there will be smaller ones soon,\u201d Denolle said. When it comes to prediction, researchers understandably want to make sure they don\u2019t overpromise and underdeliver, especially when thousands of lives and billions of dollars in damages are at stake. But even this caution has had consequences. In 2012, six Italian scientists were for accurately saying the risks of a large earthquake in the town of L\u2019Aquila were low after a small cluster of earthquakes struck the region in 2009. to assess the risk, a large quake struck and killed 309 people. Those convictions were and the ordeal has become a for how scientists convey uncertainty and risk to the public. 4) Sorry, your pets can\u2019t predict earthquakes either Reports of animals acting strange ahead of earthquakes date back to ancient Greece. But a useful pattern remains elusive. Feathered and furry forecasters emerge every time there\u2019s an earthquake and there\u2019s a cute animal to photograph, but this phenomenon is . Animals do weird things (by our standards) all the time and we don\u2019t attach any significance to them until an earthquake happens. \u201cOn any given day, there will be hundreds of pets doing things they\u2019ve never done before and have never done afterward,\u201d Beroza said. Bottom line: Don\u2019t wait for weird animal behavior to signal that an earthquake is coming. 5) Some earthquakes are definitely man-made The gargantuan expansion of hydraulic fracturing across the United States has left an in its wake. It\u2019s not the actual fracturing of shale rock that leads to tremors, but the injection of millions of gallons of wastewater underground. Scientists say the injected water makes it easier for rocks to slide past each other. \u201cWhen you inject fluid, you lubricate faults,\u201d Denolle said. The US Geological Survey calls these \u201cinduced earthquakes\u201d and reported that in Oklahoma, the number of earthquakes surged to 2,500 in 2014, 4,000 in 2015, and 2,500 in 2016. \u201cThe decline in 2016 may be due in part to injection restrictions implemented by the state officials,\u201d the USGS . \u201cOf the earthquakes last year, 21 were greater than magnitude 4.0 and three were greater than magnitude 5.0.\u201d This is up from an average of two earthquakes per year of magnitude 2.7 or greater between 1980 and 2000. (\u201cNatural\u201d earthquakes, on the other hand, are not becoming more frequent, according to Beroza.) Humans are causing earthquakes another way, too: Rapidly drawing water from underground reservoirs has also been shown to cause quakes in cities like Jakarta, Denolle said. 6) Climate change could have a tiny effect on earthquakes In general, scientists haven\u2019t measured any effect on earthquakes from climate change. But they\u2019re not ruling out the possibility. As average temperatures rise, massive ice sheets are melting, shifting billions of tons of water from exposed land into the ocean and allowing land masses to rebound. That global rebalancing could have , but signals haven\u2019t emerged yet. \u201cWhat might occur is enough ice melts that could unload the crust,\u201d Beroza said, but added there is no evidence for this, nor for which parts of the world will reveal a signal. Denolle agreed that this could be a mechanism, but if there is any impact from climate change on earthquakes, she says she suspects it will be very small. 7) We\u2019ve gotten better reducing earthquake risks and saving lives About occur in the Ring of Fire, the region around the Pacific Ocean running through places like the Philippines, Japan, Alaska, California, Mexico, and Chile. The ring is also home to three-quarters of all active volcanoes. Mexico is an especially interesting case study. The country sits on top of three tectonic plates, making it seismically active. In 1985, an earthquake struck the capital, . Denolle noted that the geology of the region makes it so that tremors from nearby areas are channeled toward Mexico City, making any seismic activity a threat. The Mexican capital is built on the site of the ancient Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, an island in the middle of a lake. The dry lakebed that is now the foundation of the modern metropolis amplifies shaking from earthquakes. The 1985 earthquake originated closer to the surface, and the seismic waves it produced had a relatively long time between peaks and valleys. This low-frequency vibration sends skyscrapers swaying, according to Denolle. \u201cThe recent earthquakes were deeper, so they had a higher frequency,\u201d she said. The biggest factor in preventing deaths from earthquakes is building codes. Designing buildings to move with the earth while remaining standing can save thousands of lives, but putting them into practice can be expensive and frequently becomes a political issue. \u201cUltimately, that information has got to get implemented, and you can pretty much get that implemented in new construction,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cThe trickier problem is existing buildings and older stock.\u201d Earthquake-prone countries know this well: Japan has been regularly to withstand earthquakes. The revised standards have in part fueled Japan\u2019s construction boom despite its declining population. Mexico has also raised standards for new construction. Laws enacted after the 1985 earthquake required builders to account for the soft lakebed soil in the capital and tolerate some degree of movement. Meanwhile, Iran has gone through several versions of its national building standards for earthquake resilience. And Alaska has been developing earthquake damage and for years. But , and the new rules only apply to new buildings. A school that collapsed in a 2017 Mexico City earthquake apparently was an older building that was not earthquake-resistant. And because the more recent earthquakes in Mexico shook the ground in a different way, even some of the buildings that survived the 1985 earthquake in 2017. In countries like Iran, there is a wide gulf between how buildings are constructed in cities versus the countryside. More than a quarter of the country\u2019s population , where homes are built using traditional materials like mud bricks and stone rather than reinforced concrete and steel. This is a big part of why casualties are so high when earthquakes strike remote parts of the country. The biggest risks fall to countries that don\u2019t have a major earthquake in living memory and therefore haven\u2019t prepared for them, or don\u2019t have the resources to do so. A led to many of the more than in Haiti stemming from the 2010 magnitude 7.0 earthquake. 8) The big one really is coming to the United States (someday) The you keep hearing about is real. The New Yorker won a Pulitzer Prize in 2015 for its reporting on the potential for massive earthquake that would rock the Pacific Northwest \u2014 \u201cthe worst natural disaster in the history of North America,\u201d which would impact 7 million people and span a region covering 140,000 square miles. The potential quake could reach a magnitude between 8.7 and 9.2, bigger than the largest expected earthquake from the San Andreas Fault, which scientist expect to top out at magnitude 8.2. Large earthquakes are also in store for Japan, New Zealand, and other parts of the Ring of Fire. We don\u2019t know when these earthquakes will rock us; we just have a rough estimate of the average time between them, which changes from region to region. \u201cIn the business, we\u2019ve been talking about that [Pacific Northwest] scenario for decades,\u201d Beroza said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re overdue, but it could happen at any time.\u201d \u201cIt is a threat,\u201d echoed Denolle. \u201cWe forget about this threat because we have not had an earthquake there for a while.\u201d \u201cA while\u201d means more than 300 years. So while California has long been steeling itself for big earthquakes with building codes and disaster planning, the Pacific Northwest may be caught off guard, though the author of the New Yorker piece, Kathryn Schulz, helpfully provided a .", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 16:32:43", "image_url": null, "source_id": "vox", "source_priority": 889, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["environment"], "language": "english"}, {"article_id": "4bcb61ffa89d9496d7372b898bd248cf", "title": "Group of 20 countries agree to increase clean energy but reach no deal on phasing out fossil fuels", "link": "https://qz.com/group-of-20-countries-agree-to-increase-clean-energy-bu-1850821952", "keywords": null, "creator": ["Sibi Arasu, Associated Press"], "video_url": null, "description": "NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 Group of 20 leaders agreed Saturday to triple renewable energy and try to increase the funds for climate change-related disasters but maintained the status quo with regards to phasing out carbon spewing coal.

The Fenix E20 V2 for $45 is my top pick for an affordable emergency flashlight, but the ThruNite Archer 2A V3 for $30 is another solid choice. At 350 and 500 lumens, respectively, they're bright enough while remaining compact, and they last long on lower-light settings\u2014200 hours at 5 lumens for the Fenix and 51 hours at 17 lumens for the ThruNite. Both use two AA batteries, and in an emergency your main concern is to have a good supply of replacement batteries. If you're using alkaline batteries, remove them from the flashlight if it's going to sit unused for a long time, otherwise they'll leak and cause problems. Store them near the flashlight so you can easily find them. Try taping the batteries to the flashlight barrel. Pro tip: The best-performing flashlights are built specifically to use lithium-ion batteries or have nonremovable rechargeable batteries, which won't do you any good if the power is out for a long time. Rechargeable nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) AA batteries maintain their performance better over the lifetime of the battery, whereas alkalines\u2019 performance drops off more as they deplete, so buy some Panasonic Eneloops for $43 . They're better for the environment, but if they run out of charge you can still use regular alkaline AAs. You may prefer to keep a headlamp handy. The Black Diamond Astro 300 for $20 runs on three easily found AAA batteries and has three brightness settings, the brightest of which throws 300 lumens. That's more than powerful enough for tasks outside the home, while you can squeeze 140 hours of runtime out of the lowest setting for general tasks indoors. Coleman 4D LED Camp Lantern Coleman discontinued our previous favorite pick, the Divide+ Push Lantern, so the Coleman 4D LED Camp Lantern for $22 is the next-best choice for not a lot of coin. Flashlights do a poor job when you need to light up a whole room or if you need your hands free for a task. This basic lantern offers a single setting of 54 lumens, with a runtime of 175 hours on four D-cell batteries. That sounds like a lot, but next to other full-size battery-powered lanterns, such as the Coleman Twin LED lantern that uses eight D cells, it's economical. Fifty-four lumens is not what I'd call bright, but it is plenty bright enough for most tasks, even reading, while conserving battery life. If you want to save batteries or just prefer hanging out by gentle flickering candlelight, keep a spare emergency candle or two. The Coghlan's 36-Hour Survival Candle for $15 has three wicks that'll last for 12 hours each. Keep a lighter or some matches nearby. Lifestraw Go Water Bottle Most of the time, your water supply will work even when the power goes out. But major natural disasters can knock it out or damage it, and you might get dirty water. The LifeStraw Go Series Water Purifier Bottle for $45 marries the straw component of the LifeStraw Personal Water Filter with a BPA-free plastic bottle to filter out 99.99 percent of waterborne bacteria for up to 26 gallons of water. The original, bottle-less straw is still a good backup option for $17, and it'll filter up to 1,000 gallons. Another option is the Katadyn Steripen Adventurer for $120 , which purifies using ultraviolet light. Dunk it in your water and stir. It won\u2019t filter out sediment, but it\u2019s small, lightweight, and runs on replaceable CR123 batteries. You can also try Katadyn Micropur tablets for $16 . They're cheap and easy to store. Drop them in water and wait briefly. The taste isn\u2019t great, but no water-treatment tablets or droplets are, in my experience. If you have a large household, you may prefer something like the MSR AutoFlow XL Gravity Filter for $125 . Gravity filters take longer to purify water. You can boil water, but it won\u2019t filter out sediment, and boiling uses fuel and takes time. Coway Airmega 200M Wildfires are becoming an annual hazard, especially on the West Coast of the US, and they can spread dangerous amounts of particulate throughout the air. Homes aren't very airtight at all. Keep that toxic, carcinogenic junk out of your indoor air (and out of your lungs) by purchasing an air purifier for your home. The Coway Airmega 200M for $197 is my favorite affordable model for a small room, such as a bedroom or home office. For a larger room (up to 930 square feet), the Coway Airmega 250 for $400 is our top pick. Like the 200M, it has a smart setting that ramps up the filtering power automatically when needed; after several years of testing, both models are still going strong. Check out our Best Air Purifiers guide for more recommendations from the WIRED Gear Team. You probably already have some face masks at home, but if you don't and you live in a region susceptible to wildfires, you should pick up a box of disposable, medical-grade masks so you can breathe easier if the air becomes saturated with smoke. Fortunately, the best masks that protect against Covid-19 also protect well against smoke. We recommend the Powecom KN95 10-Pack for $12 . If these are out of stock, as many masks frequently are, check out our Best Disposable Face Masks guide. Coleman Gas Camping Stove Safety note: Don't use any of these stoves indoors. All of these fuels give off potentially deadly fumes that can accumulate and kill. Still made in the US, the classic Coleman Propane Camp Stove for $48 really hasn't changed much over the years. Propane is easy to use if you remember to stock up, and it's clean-burning. If propane is not your thing, get the Coleman Guide-Series Dual Fuel Camp Stove $198 . Camp fuel (also known as Coleman fuel and white gas) burns relatively cleanly, is easy to find for sale, and is an ideal camp stove fuel. You can also use gasoline in the Dual Fuel, but gasoline contains a lot of additives that gunk up the stove's internals, and you'll need to clean the stove out much more frequently. Get a Coleman Filtering Funnel for $11 if you purchase a liquid-fuel stove. The Sterno Outdoor Folding Camp Stove for $14 folds up so small that it's an easy option for people without room to keep a full-size stove around. It's an inexpensive backup that's handy to have, even if you've got a nice camp stove or a backpacking stove like an MSR Pocket Rocket for $85 . Our previous pick, the Jetboil Zip for $95 , is a fine stove for making single-serve hot drinks and soupy meals, but with the MSR you can use your regular cookware to make multiperson meals. It's not as fancy as the Colemans, but it's a lot easier to store in a crowded apartment. Make sure you grab an MSR IsoPro Fuel Canister for $11 . This large, 16-ounce size is best, in case the emergency lasts for several days. GSI Outdoors Pioneer Table Set Your regular cooking utensils, eating utensils, and metal, plastic, and wooden cookware can all be used during an emergency, but glass or ceramic drinking glasses and plates are a different case, as they can shatter. It'll be tough cleaning up the pieces with no power. When the lights go out, switch to this enameled steel dishware, such as the GSI Outdoors Pioneer Table Set for $130 . If somebody drops a piece, no big deal. Assuming your home's water supply is still working (and clean), the water will come out of the pipes somewhat cooler than the ambient air temperature. Having an insulated bottle will help conserve that precious coolness if you don't like drinking room-temperature water. The Klean Kanteen Insulated Classic for $34 is much easier to find for sale than the Miir\u2014the top pick in our Best Reusable Water Bottles guide\u2014and I found it remarkably durable. For more drinkware, check out our Best Insulated Travel Mugs guide. Stock up on items that don't require refrigeration and have long shelf lives. Rather than making a grocery run for eggs and milk, pick up foods such as instant rice, dried fruit, and oatmeal. If you don't have room for a camp stove or live in a busy city where it may be tough to cook outside when the power goes out, or if you just don't like to cook, pick up a Mountain House 3-Day Adventure Dehydrated Meal Kit for $105 . All you need to do is add water. If the power does go out, keep your refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible, to keep the stuff inside fresh for as long as possible. Leatherman Wave Plus For small jobs, a good do-it-all multi-tool such as the Leatherman Wave Plus for $120 is a lifesaver. When the lights are out and there's emergency gear spread out all over the home, it's especially annoying to keep going out to the garage to retrieve one tool after another. Carry them all in one tool in your pocket and cut the number of trips way down. If you only need a knife, the made-in-France Opinel No. 8 folding knife for $19 is an excellent choice. For such little money, the stainless steel blade\u2014which can be locked open or closed\u2014is remarkably sharp and well-shaped. Because it's so light, I often take it hiking instead of a chunkier knife. You may have to board up windows. Nails have increased sheer strength (that is, strength against forces perpendicular to the head). You'll need a good hammer. Since the slightly more affordable Plumb we recommend in my How to Build a Home Tool Kit guide is sold out, you may as well step up to my favorite hammer, the Vaughan 20-ounce Smooth Face Hickory-Handle Hammer, for $27 . Forget metal-handled hammers. They transit a lot of striking force to your hand through the handle. Fiberglass or wood is more forgiving. Pick up a pound or two of common nails while you're at it. You may need to repair items around the home, too, so it wouldn't hurt to have a good drill handy. The DeWalt 20V Max 1/2-Inch Cordless Drill for $99 is my favorite drill, and the best deal in cordless drills on the market. I recommend it for all homeowners, but it comes especially in handy when you have a lot of screws to drive in a hurry. A DeWalt 14-piece Screw Bit Set for $11 is a solid, affordable set of drill bits to use with your drill. It's difficult for most people to store a bunch of spare lumber in case of an emergency\u2014you'll just have to go to the hardware store to stock up at the earliest sign of trouble\u2014but it's easy to go ahead and store a big box of general purpose screws. Some 2-inch wood screws should do the trick. Make sure they're wood screws, which are designed specifically to go into wood. Some odds and ends will come in handy, too. Always keep a roll of duct tape for $8 handy, and a screwdriver in case your cordless drill runs out of power and you're unable to recharge it. A Channellock 6-in-1 Screwdriver for $8 has the main screwdriver bit sizes, both flathead and Phillips, and keeps everything compact by storing the bits inside itself. Mosey on over to our article How to Put Together a Home Tool Kit and our guide to the Best Multi-Tools for most information on preparing your home for natural disasters. Coleman Quick Bed Single High Airbed Mattress You'll need more beds if other folks stay with you during an emergency. Generally, I hate how inflatable mattresses deflate under my body weight by the early morning hours. The only exceptions I've found are Coleman mattresses, which have air nozzles designed to seal tighter when bodyweight is on top of the mattress. When I used the Quick Bed Single High Mattress Queen-Size for $53 last, I slept three nights before having to top it off with more air. Pick up a manual air pump if you don't already have a bicycle or sports pump. There's also the Coleman Pack-Away Camping Cot for $76 . Unlike most cots, this one doesn't have horizontal bars across the head and foot ends. Bars like that are evil. I've whacked my head and ankles on them enough for two lifetimes. You can use a rectangular sleeping bag (instead of a mummy bag) so that you have more room to stretch out. The Coleman Brazos 30 Sleeping Bag for $47 and Alps Mountaineering Crescent Lake 20F Sleeping Bag for $55 are solid options that won't break the bank. For warmer seasons when you might need something during cool nights, the Marmot NanoWave 55 Sleeping Bag for $79 is a personal favorite. It's rated to 55 degrees Fahrenheight and is just roomy enough not to feel constricting while also packing down into the size of a water bottle. Keep in mind that temperature ratings on sleeping bags are often overly optimistic, especially for women, who tend to sleep colder than men. Anker Portable Charger Anker makes my favorite power banks, which I use when traveling and during power outages to keep my phone topped off. That's important during emergencies for communicating with people. You can get by for days with a slim model like the Anker PowerCore Slim 10,000-mAh Portable Charger for $24 , but if you know you'll be on your phone much more or using an iPad, steer toward the PowerCore 26,800-mAh for $26 . Remember to check it periodically, pre-emergency, to keep it fully charged. Read our Best Portable Chargers guide for more. If you'd like to plan for longer emergencies, in situations where you may run down a battery bank before the power comes back on, consider the Powerfilm Solar Lightsaver for $200 . Barely the size of a small flashlight when rolled up, this compact solar panel charges fully in only six hours. Once it's charged, connect it via a USB cable to whichever device needs extra juice. It can also double as a standard battery bank if you charge it via a wall outlet, which takes about three hours with the included micro USB cable. You'll also want a portable radio, such as the Sony Portable AM/FM Radio for $40 , to hear weather reports and emergency broadcasts. Even if you don't ordinarily listen to terrestrial radio, you should have one and not rely on your phone. As with your flashlight, take the batteries out and store them with the radio. Fjallraven jacket Make sure you\u2019ve got warm clothing to wear indoors if the power goes out. The Uniqlo Fluffy Yarn Fleece Jacket ( men , women ) for $40 and REI Co-Op 650 Down Jacket 2.0 ( men , women ) for $100 are insanely warm, as are Uniqlo\u2019s Heattech long john tops ( men , women ) for $30 and bottoms ( men , women ) for $30 . If you end up outside cutting up trees and fixing busted fences after a disaster, you might not want to get your regular jacket torn up or muddy. My Carharrt Duck Sherpa-Lined Coat for $130 is very warm and very tough; I\u2019ve subjected it to all kinds of abuse. There's a similarly tough Carharrt Duck Sherpa-Lined Coat in women's sizing for $130 . Fjallraven is another tough outerwear brand that makes jackets we like. While you\u2019re at it, check out our gift guide for people who're always cold . Don\u2019t forget a cozy blanket, such as the L.L.Bean Wicked Plush Throw for $30 , and keep your feet warm with Glerups' Wool Slippers for $100 and Darn Tough wool socks for $23 . They're expensive, but they\u2019ve kept my feet warm through a few disasters. Hario Skerton Pro. Mr. Coffee and Keurig don't work when the power's out, but you'll still want your morning cup of joe. I'm one of WIRED's many coffee-worshiping zealots, and my favorite coffee grinder is the manual Hario Skerton Pro for $51 . Its base is made of thick glass that's survived more than a few drops onto my hardwood floor, and you can adjust the grind size to be suitable for anything from espresso to French press. For pour-overs, the ceramic Hario V60 Size 02 for $21 is perfect for making a big cup for one person at a time. If you do pour-over, you'll need to keep coffee filters for $6 around, and you'll need a gooseneck kettle to control the pour. The best stovetop one I've used is the Hario V60 Jino Gooseneck Kettle for $44. For French press, the Frieling 23-Ounce for $120 is my pick. It's double-wall insulated, so you won't burn your hands, and it's big enough to make a couple of big cups of coffee at a time. The AeroPress for $40 also comes highly recommended by another WIRED coffee addict. Check out our Best Insulated Travel Mugs and Best Portable Coffee Makers guides for more. Luggable Loo Your shower is likely to work just fine, but the Simple Shower Gravity Shower Kit for $12 is an inexpensive, compact backup if your home loses its supply of clean tap water. This kit screws onto a common soda bottle. Hang it upside down and it'll feed water onto the bather. You can use it anywhere, but you may as well set it up in your regular shower. If you hang it off the showerhead pipe, just make sure the weight won't tear it out of the wall or bend it. This product tends to go in and out of stock, so if it's currently unavailable, just keep an eye on the product page. Toilets usually will still flush fine in an emergency, and if they stop refilling you can flush a toilet by pouring water into the back tank (not the bowl). If your home's water supply is broken for days, eventually you'll need somewhere else to go. Buy a Luggable Loo Toilet Seat Lid for $16 and a 5-Gallon Bucket for $5 to construct a makeshift toilet. Don't forget waste bags for $14 to line the bucket. Keep a bag of kitty litter nearby, along with a cheap trowel for $6 for scooping it into the bucket after each use, extra toilet paper, and hand sanitizer. Champion Dual Fuel 3650-Watt Most of the time, you can get by without a generator and manage to stay warm, cook, and keep some lights on. You have to maintain generators, make sure you store enough fuel, and empty their tanks before they sit unused for a long time\u2014or use a fuel stabilizer for $9 . If you need a generator for medical equipment or think the luxury is worth the hassle, Honda makes excellent ones; Briggs & Stratton motors are solid too. But honestly, if you have to buy a big, hulking generator that\u2019ll sit unused most of the time, and you\u2019re watching your pennies, you can get by with a cheap one such as the Champion Dual Fuel 3650-Watt for $575 . Pro tip: Change the spark plug to a brand-name one as soon as you bring it home. The stock spark plugs that come with these Chinese generators tend to be junk. Just remember that gasoline spoils relatively quickly, needs to be prepared for inactivity with fuel stabilizers, and must be drained after a year. This is why, for most people, a generator isn't worth it (especially if you follow the rest of this guide). You should keep some spare gas around, as well. Whether you need it for your generator or your car, buy a fuel can that's made specifically for storing fuel safely. The Garage Boss Press N Pour for $28 will hold 5 gallons of gasoline and comes with a safety nozzle that only releases fuel when the spout is pressed to the gas tank opening. Just remember that cans are typically color-coded to the types of fuel they hold, in order to reduce the chance of costly or dangerous mix-ups. Gasoline goes in red canisters, and diesel goes in yellow . You probably have most of the medical essentials such as bandages and ibuprofen, but you should have a more robust medical kit for emergencies. Check out my guide on How to Make a First Aid Kit . It'll tell you how to build a bomber kit for less money than the storebought versions. If that sounds like a daunting task, the Adventure Medical Kits Mountain Series Explorer Medical Kit for $70 will cover the bases.. They also make medical kits that include directions for pets and their humans for $57 . If someone gets hurt badly, you might not be able to get to a hospital right away. It's a good idea to learn some first aid. You can take NOLS Wilderness First Aid courses through REI. From my experiences over the past four years, NOLS has fantastic instructors and a thorough hands-on curriculum. Natural disasters can be pretty boring during the non-panicky parts. Power outages involve lots of sitting around, so pick up a card game or a board game to play. I recommend Exploding Kittens for $20 to soothe everybody's nerves\u2014or aggravate them in an entertaining manner. It also has no small pieces to lose in the dark. For board games, check out one of our favorites: Ticket to Ride for $48 . Check out more of WIRED's Favorite Board Games for ways to pass the time during trying times. Finally, you should read WIRED senior associate reviews editor Adrienne So's article on why the best emergency gear is other people .

A California scientist admitted that he \"left out the full truth\" about climate change, blaming it primarily on human causes, to get his study published in a prestigious science journal. Patrick T. Brown, a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University and doctor of earth and climate sciences, admitted in an online article in The Free Press , a blog post and a series of social media posts that h e distort ed th e findings of his studi es to app eal to th e e ditors at Nature and Science magazines, which are prestigious online science journals. \"And the editors of these journals have made it abundantly clear, both by what they publish and what they reject, that they want climate papers that support certain preapproved narratives\u2014even when those narratives come at the expense of broader knowledge for society,\" Brown wrote in The Free Press. WILDFIRES AREN'T GETTING WORSE BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE REAL CULPRIT WILL SURPRISE YOU Patrick T. Brown's study published in Nature magazine on Aug. 30 stated that climate change affected extreme wildfire behavior like the devastating fires in California and Maui. (AP Photo/Eric Thayer) Brown's study published in Nature on Aug. 30 stated that climate change affected extreme wildfire behavior like the devastating fires in California and Maui . The established scientist now admits that he \"focused narrowly\" only on the human influence of wildfires, instead of focusing broadly on the complexities of other \"obviously relevant factors.\" He blamed his angle on the pressure scientists face to get their studies published in prestigious articles and the need to create catchy abstracts that can be turned into headlines. Brown said in The Free Press he is not \"disowning\" his paper by criticizing how he chose to approach the piece, but admitting it is less \"useful than it could have been.\" \"You might be wondering at this point if I\u2019m disowning my own paper. I\u2019m not,\" Brown wrote. \"On the contrary, I think it advances our understanding of climate change\u2019s role in day-to-day wildfire behavior. It\u2019s just that the process of customizing the research for an eminent journal caused it to be less useful than it could have been.\" Brown wrote that the study didn\u2019t look at poor forest management and other factors that are just as important to fire behavior because he \"knew that it would detract from the clean narrative centered on the negative impact of climate change and thus decrease the odds that the paper would pass muster with Nature\u2019s editors and reviewers.\" He added such bias in climate science \"misinforms the public\" and \"makes practical solutions more difficult to achieve.\" \"Identifying and focusing on problems rather than studying the effectiveness of solutions makes for more compelling abstracts that can be turned into headlines, but it is a major reason why high-profile research is not as useful to society as it could be,\" Brown wrote in an X (formerly Twitter) thread on Sept. 5. Brown admitted his study didn\u2019t look at poor forest management and other factors important to fire behavior because he knew that would \"decrease the odds that the paper would pass muster with Nature\u2019s editors and reviewers.\" (AP Photo/Noah Berger) California Assembly leader James Gallagher, a Republican, blasted liberals by saying that they \"cherry-pick data\" to \"fit their agenda.\" \"Patrick Brown is saying the quiet part out loud - liberals are cherry-picking data to fit an agenda and push radical policies that drive up the cost of living,\" Gallagher told Fox News Digital. \"Climate change is Democrats\u2019 excuse to avoid blame for turning our forests into tinderboxes.\" BIDEN TRASHED FOR EMBELLISHING HOUSE FIRE WHILE TRYING TO RELATE TO NATURAL DISASTER VICTIMS: \u2018LYING AGAIN\u2019 \"If they don\u2019t get serious about forest management, we\u2019re going to see even more mega-fires destroying the landscape,\" Gallagher continued.

As of Friday, the lighting-sparked fire was estimated to be about . It has crept within a mile of one of the watershed\u2019s two drinking water reservoirs and about 2 miles from the Headworks treatment plant, which disinfects all Bull Run water. Water from the Bull Run \u2013 about 25 miles east of downtown Portland in Mount Hood National Forest \u2013 serves about 1 million Portland-area residents and provides water to 19 water districts through wholesale contracts, including the cities of Gresham, Sandy and Tualatin. Here\u2019s what you need to know. Though , the Camp Creek fire \u2013 named for the nearby Camp Creek Trail \u2013 is by far the largest in decades, said Edward Campbell, the Portland Water Bureau\u2019s deputy director. \u201cThis is definitely the closest fire we\u2019ve had to our facilities in at least a half-century,\u201d Campbell told The Oregonian/OregonLive.com. Water from the Bull Run River \u2013 which mostly comes from rainfall \u2013 is diverted by dams to two reservoirs in the forest, then treated and piped to Portland and other cities. The 2017 Eagle Creek Fire, which burned through nearly 49,000 acres of forest in the Columbia River Gorge, came close, . The Water Bureau is closely monitoring water in the reservoirs and says the water is safe to drink. But the fire could, under certain conditions, lead to the shutdown of the Bull Run system. If it gets too close to the Headworks plant, staff will have to evacuate, prompting a shutdown of the treatment plant and the Bull Run water source. As of this week, five to 15 staff members continue to work in the watershed, depending on the day, managing the treatment facility, conducting water quality testing, performing critical maintenance and monitoring and removing vegetation to help contain the fire, water officials said. Bull Run would also be shut down if the fire impairs water quality in the reservoirs. Heavy rains could wash ash, other burned materials and higher-than-average volumes of dirt into streams and reservoirs, leading to an increase in turbidity (the amount of particles suspended in the water). And because high turbidity decreases the effectiveness of water disinfection, it can make water unsafe to drink. To be clear, fires don\u2019t cause turbidity, Campbell said. The Water Bureau has shut down the Bull Run water source 11 times since 1985, most recently in November 2022 after a big storm. But fire can potentially increase turbidity, he said. Higher volumes of burned materials in the reservoirs can also increase the amount of phosphorus and other nutrients, leading to an increase in algae blooms. Ash and sediment can also react with chlorine, leading to health problems. The bureau has worked for years with the U.S. Forest Service, the Oregon Department of Forestry and local fire districts to prepare. The Forest Service, in conjunction with the other agencies, drafted the , which prioritizes protecting the drinking water source. The plan, reviewed annually, includes guidelines on fire prevention and fire response strategies, including minimizing erosion and sedimentation by avoiding fireline construction near streambanks and reducing pollution in the watershed by capturing spills from heavy equipment and routing road runoff away from streams. The bureau also uses a lightning detection service. Each time lightning strikes, staff can see where the strikes occurred and are able to check the area for fire starts. A fire retardant called was used on Aug. 25 and 26 inside the watershed, said Karen Dante-Wood, a spokesperson for the Great Basin Incident Management Team in charge of fighting the fire. The decision to use fire retardant \u2013 or any other firefighting strategy \u2013 is made by the federal firefighting agencies. Water Bureau officials told The Oregonian/OregonLive.com that\u2019s the only time retardant has ever been used in the watershed. Phos-Chek \u2013 composed of 85% water, 10% fertilizer and 5% other ingredients \u2013 is the most commonly used retardant in Oregon and Washington, Dante-Wood said, and is generally sprayed when high-value resources are at risk. Some , saying it can harm soil, plants, fish and other species and cause more plants to grow, adding fuel to future fires. But the Multnomah County Health Department has determined that the risk to human health from using fire retardant in the Bull Run watershed is negligible, Water Bureau spokesperson Felicia Heaton said. The Water Bureau hasn\u2019t detected the chemical associated with the fire retardant (namely, phosphorus, a key ingredient in fertilizer) in any of the samples it regularly takes in or near the reservoirs, Heaton said. Even if it were detected, the reservoir near the fire holds 7 billion gallons of water, meaning the dilution rate would be so high that the retardant would have little impact on water quality. No preventive forest management \u2013 including or tree thinning when no fires are active \u2013 has been done to date in the Bull Run watershed. That\u2019s in part because in the Bull Run. It\u2019s also because of the distinct ecology of the Bull Run forest \u2013 a temperate old growth rainforest where regrowth is so productive that forest management can actually increase fire risk by stimulating new growth, said Campbell, the Water Bureau deputy director. When the Bull Run system shuts down, the Water Bureau relies on its . That system has enough water to serve as the region\u2019s sole water source for 60 days, Campbell said. Typically, groundwater serves as a supplemental water source during dry summer seasons, for about a month on average. In late August, due to high temperatures, not the fire. But groundwater is also Portland\u2019s emergency backup supply. Since the groundwater system came online in 1985, the city has relied exclusively on groundwater 19 times due to Bull Run system disruptions. The longest emergency groundwater use happened in 2017 for 31 days due to the detection of . If the system had to be shut down for longer, Edwards said, Portland would ask its wholesale customers to rely on their other drinking water sources and the public to restrict water use. The possibility that the fire will destroy Headworks is slim, Campbell said. If fire directly threatens the plant, firefighters will wrap it in fireproof material. They\u2019ll also clear brush around it and set up sprinklers to keep it wet. The same approach was successfully used in the Eagle Creek fire , he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of optimism that we can protect our facility even if we do have to evacuate it,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe\u2019re not expecting any real devastating impacts at this point.\u201d The Water Bureau is evaluating the possibility of building a temporary treatment facility in the unlikely scenario that the Camp Creek fire damages the Headworks plant beyond repair, said Heaton, the Water Bureau spokesperson. Plans would be finalized only after the existing plant sustains damage, she said. In the meantime, the Water Bureau plans to break ground in September on a massive new Bull Run water filtration plant, to be located just outside the Bull Run watershed. When completed in 2027, the new facility will increase the system\u2019s resilience to wildfires, Campbell said, by reducing the impacts of water turbidity. (Per federal mandates, the new plant also will help filter out the parasite cryptosporidium, which occasionally shows up in Bull Run water.) Earlier this summer, Portland officials said the price tag for the new plant , a nearly four-fold increase from the $500 million plan first approved by Portland\u2019s elected leaders six years ago. The increase is due to ballooning construction costs and a tight labor market, city officials said. Construction costs will be paid by ratepayers through a series of annual water rate hikes and by a low-interest loan from the federal Environmental Protection Agency. The fire has strengthened the relationships and partnerships within the city and with local and federal firefighting agencies, Campbell said, reinforcing the need for continued coordination, planning and sharing of information. It also has highlighted the need to do more work on how climate change amplifies the frequency and intensity of natural disasters and how individual disasters can affect the Bull Run\u2019s water supply, he said. The Water Bureau already employs climate scientists who analyze water supply availability, but their focus has been on long-term projections rather than the impact of particular natural emergencies such as wildfires, Campbell said. The fire is also a good reminder that Portlanders should prepare in case of future water restrictions, which may become more common due to climate change. \u201cDisruptions to water service,\u201d Heaton said, \u201ccan happen at any time.\u201d \u2013 Gosia Wozniacka; ; @gosiawozniacka", "pubDate": "2023-09-09 00:31:04", "image_url": "https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/HHxvHHxmnRme2gwPFmftMHguKFc=/0x1200/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/PHE3W2XWIREK3OCG6GTXTVGE44.jpg", "source_id": "oregonlive", "source_priority": 2111, "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "language": "english"}], "nextPage": "1694219464991707109"}
