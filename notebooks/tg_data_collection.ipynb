       "   'description': 'Donald Trump stopped at a fraternity house before heading to watch the Iowa-Iowa State football game',\n",
       "   'content': 'AMES, Iowa (AP) — Donald Trump stepped out of a fraternity house to the cheers of hundreds of Iowa State University students and tossed autographed footballs into the crowd. “I guess the youth likes Trump,” he said over the cheers of the students, speaking to the Right Side Broadcasting Network, which supports his candidacy. Then, the former president entered a motorcade to head to a private stadium suite where he watched the school\\'s annual football grudge match Saturday with the University of Iowa. The pregame campus stop was a reminder of Trump\\'s dominant position atop a crowded Republican field both in Iowa and nationally. Several of his rivals also attended the game, mingling with fans at pregame tailgates outside the stadium. But Trump got by far the most attention and hasn\\'t paid a price yet for skipping the closer interactions with voters that are a cherished Iowa political tradition. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has struggled to position himself as a potent foe to Trump, came to Ames to attend the game with Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has not endorsed a candidate but often has appeared with DeSantis and his wife, Casey. As he moved from one tailgate to another, DeSantis was flanked by fans cheering and waving campaign signs from a booth hosted by the pro-DeSantis Never Back Down super PAC. “We’re having a good time,” DeSantis told reporters. “It’s quite an atmosphere, probably a little bit more civilized than the Florida-Georgia game.” Trump has made a habit of visiting Iowa on the same day as DeSantis, whom Trump treats as his main threat. Their dynamic Saturday was similar to last month when Trump drew huge crowds to the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines while DeSantis addressed smaller audiences and hit the midway rides with his family. At the Alpha Gamma Rho house, students tried to photograph Trump as he worked the crowd outside the red-brick fraternity house and flipped hamburgers at the grill. There were some insults during the day. Some fans walking the streets made profane gestures at his motorcade as it moved through Ames. Prop planes flew over the stadium carrying a banner that read, “Where\\'s Melania?” The former first lady has been largely absent from the campaign so far. And hired performers wearing inflatable costumes, one posing as Trump and the other infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, held hands as they roamed the parking lot in face masks. Also appearing before the game were candidates Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor, and Asa Hutchinson, a former Arkansas governor, who greeted each other at a tailgate honoring veterans, where Sen. Joni Ernst camped out for most of the afternoon. While fans showed up Saturday for football, not politics, voters have had the chance to see most candidates who regularly appear at Iowa cattle calls and meet-and-greets. DeSantis is increasingly focused on winning or placing high in Iowa and says he\\'s visited more than half of the state\\'s 99 counties already. Trump, meanwhile, had made only six visits to Iowa this year before Saturday. Still, his campaign has been working in his absence, promising a more disciplined, data-driven effort for the organizational-heavy caucuses than his first campaign in 2016, when he finished second to Ted Cruz. Trump’s campaign set up several booths around the parking lots, with his volunteers working to get fans to sign caucus pledge cards. He sat at the game with Iowa casino powerhouse Gary Kirke, an influential Republican donor. Trump waved at fans from the window of a skybox, though he entertained visitors who were allowed in and out before he left the game during the third quarter. Last week, Trump held a conference call with tens of thousands of Iowans. And he has done some face-to-face stops in Iowa with voters. In June, he handed out Dairy Queen “Blizzards\" while also confessing aloud that he did not know what the soft-serve treats were. There is no comparable example in Iowa political history to a former president running to reclaim his old office while also under indictment for more than 90 felony counts. But other high-profile candidates and strong front-runners have done the town halls and retail campaigning for which Iowa and other early primary states are well-known. In 2007, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton entered the race for the 2008 Democratic nomination as a national celebrity and the party\\'s heavy favorite in national polling. Drawing larger crowds, Clinton sought to meet the demand by holding smaller meetings with local activists before speaking to packed gyms and halls. Clinton also attended party events with her lesser-known rivals to demonstrate her willingness to undergo the rigor that Iowans typically demand. Ultimately, she lost the 2008 caucus to then-Sen. , who eventually won the nomination and the White House. Trump has foregone all but one such event in Iowa this year. The exception was the Iowa Republican Party Lincoln Dinner in July, a marquee event that helps to finance the caucus.',\n",

       "   'content': 'Zhang Xin, the renowned Chinese entrepreneur who used her love of architecture and brilliant business acumen to reshape Beijing and Shanghai’s skyline, has turned her attention to a new challenge: film producer. In September 2022, the billionaire businesswoman — who spent her teenage years working in Hong Kong garment and electronics factories — resigned as CEO of SOHO China, one of the world’s preeminent real estate companies she built with her husband, and took up permanent residence in New York City. Zhang will celebrate the one-year anniversary of leaving SOHO at the 2023 Toronto Film Festival , where the Manhattan-based Closer Media, the startup indie production and financing venture she runs with veteran indie producer William Horberg, has no fewer than three films screening. Horberg’s numerous credits include The Queen’s Gambit and The Kite Runner . Their Toronto lineup includes the Tony Goldwyn-directed Ezra , a dramedy about an autistic 11-year-old who embarks on a road trip with his father. Newcomer William Fitzgerald, who himself is autistic, stars in the titular role opposite Bobby Cannavale, Robert De Niro, Rose Byrne, Vera Farmiga and Whoopi Goldberg. Then there’s The Monk and the Gun from Oscar-nominated Bhutanese writer-director Pawo Choyning Dorji. His new film — which sparked immediate awards buzz upon screening at the Telluride Film Festival ahead of Toronto — charts the Kingdom of Bhutan’s transition to democracy in the early 2000s in a parable about embracing modernity without disregarding the past. Zhang and Horberg are also investing heavily in documentaries. Their third Toronto entry is Alex Gibney’s In Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simon . Closer is also among the backers of Gibney’s highly anticipated Elon Musk documentary Musk alongside Anonymous Content and Black Bear (HBO won a bidding war for North American rights). And the Gibney connection doesn’t end there. Closer has a stake in acclaimed Haitian filmmaker Raoul Paul’s upcoming feature-length doc Orwell , which will be distributed in North America by Neon. Gibney’s Jigsaw Productions is among the producers of Paul’s film about the legendary George Orwell. (Paul’s 2016 film I Am Not Your Negro earned an Oscar nomination for best documentary feature). Horberg and Zhang, who work out of Midtown Manhattan office space, spoke with The Hollywood Reporter on the eve of Toronto about meeting for the first time and how they are looking to take part in the content revolution by working with established and emerging filmmakers from around the world. Xin, when you stepped down from SOHO, it was reported that you wanted to pursue being a patron of the arts. Are you also looking for a business return from your investment in Closer Media? Zhang I’ve always wanted both, just like when I was a developer. I love art, I love architecture. I always believed you can bring the highest quality of architecture to any building you build. I worked with really the most avant-garde architects, like Zaha Hadid. I of course also wanted to make money. A film can be the same. It’s a business, but I also want to make the highest-quality movies. If there’s one film that does both, it will be a dream come true, right? Horberg I’ve been doing this for many decades. When I was introduced to Xin, my clear takeaway after spending a couple of hours with her — I’ve worked with many other high-net-worth individuals — was that this person is a producer at heart. The process of going from a concept to a fully executed plan is very analogous to being a film producer. The reason we were able to quickly join forces is because we spoke the same language. Working with the best architects in the world is not unlike working with the best filmmakers. You’re managing egos and artists and trying to bring out the best, but get them to play within a certain sandbox. How do you think the strike is going to impact the fall film festivals? Horberg I think people are going to turn out because they’re movie lovers, and I think there’s going to be a lot of energy and a lot of excitement around the premiere of all these films. There’s many directors-actors who are attending TIFF , including Tony [Goldwyn]. Our young lead actor in Ezra is a 12-year-old boy with autism, and he and his parents are going to attend, but he is not going to do anything public-facing. It is such a special event for him and his family, and we didn’t want them to miss it. Does Tony Goldwyn have personal experience with autism? Horberg Yes. Tony is a lifelong best friend of Tony Spiridakis, the screenwriter. This is a very semi-autobiographical script. Tony [Spiridakis] is the father of two boys who are on the spectrum. They’re both in their late 20s now, and Tony has known them since birth. All of us were drawn to the authenticity of the script and its honesty and rawness. Tony can’t do press because of the WGA strike, but he will certainly be in Toronto. Zhang We’re very proud to have made this movie. The film’s purpose is to tell a story the world needs to know. Ezra was originally titled Inappropriate Behavior . Why the change? Horberg It had a double meaning, which is always good. You meet this boy who’s in crisis in his school and at home. And so, your immediate perception is that it’s a kid who’s behaving inappropriately. But over the course of the movie your consciousness is raised, and by the end of it, you come to see that he’s the truth teller in the story, and it’s the adults who really need to wake up to their own inappropriate behaviors. But “inappropriate behavior” has #MeToo connotations. We ultimately felt, why carry that baggage? The movie has nothing to do with that. We all agreed to change the title and it was Bob De Niro — God bless him — who said, “Why don’t you just call the movie Ezra ? The kid is so great.” Bob is a savant. He doesn’t say that much, but when he speaks, you really pay attention. How hard was it to get Paul Simon to sign up for Alex Gibney’s documentary? Horberg Alex Gibney’s the master, but it even took the master a year. But once that happened, Paul was all in. The film goes all the way back to him at 10 years old meeting Art Garfunkel in Queens. Considering the world you’ve inhabited, Xin, what do you think of Elon Musk? Zhang He’s a fascinating character. He’s clearly someone who has incredible talent to have created and built Tesla. That’s not a small feat. But he’s also someone who has, at the same time, created a cult following. It’s very important for a filmmaker like Alex Gibney, who is a clear-minded and investigative journalist, to take an objective look at Elon Musk. I met Alex about two years go and really like his work, so he started bringing things to me. Elon Musk is someone he and I talked about. What are among the secrets to your early success? Zhang I think our company will be defined by being very international . Horberg Our director, Pawo Choyning Dorji, was nominated for an Oscar for best international feature for his previous movie, Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom . He’s the first Bhutanese filmmaker ever recognized for his work in that way. Zhang Another thing we did deliberately was to build relationships within the indie film community by reaching out to production and sales companies about doing projects together. CAA is selling Ezra , while UTA, along with Altitude, is selling the Paul Simon film. A wonderful European sales agent, Films Boutique, is behind our Bhutanese film. And we have two movies with Anonymous Content [ In Restless Dreams , Orwell ], and we also have films with Black Bear Pictures [ Musk ] and Wayfarer [ Ezra ]. Who else am I missing? Horberg We’re also doing stuff with Film4 and Participant. What was it like learning that all three films were accepted into Toronto? Horberg We’re thrilled. I’ve been going to Toronto for 25 or 30 years, and it’s the best audience anywhere. I made the film Heaven with Tom Tykwer, the German director, that starred Cate Blanchett. It was screening on a Sunday morning, and Tom and I were running over to get to the theater, and there was a line of 900 people. I thought, “God, this is like a cinema heaven.” Zhang I did not know how big of a deal it was until Bill said, “This is 100 percent hit rate. You should be very happy with this.” It just made me feel so proud as someone who went to TIFF for the first time last year to just watch films. Now we have three films playing there.',\n",

       "   'content': \"“I like the stock!” In terms of revolutionary rallying cries, it’s no “ Liberté, égalité, fraternité! ” or “We will fight them on the beaches…” or “They will never take our freedom!” But by the time that Keith Gill, a.k.a. Roaring Kitty — Reddit and YouTube poster, red headband model, reluctant messiah — told a congressional committee that he’d inspired dozens of online traders to buy stock in GameStop partially because he felt it was undervalued, yet mostly because he liked it, something close to a movement had already taken place. That quote just gave it a slogan, one that let a thousand memes bloom. Hedge fund managers had bet against GameStop . Retail traders bought in bulk, driving the price up, then refused to sell. The result caused massive losses on one side and huge gains on the other. More importantly, it was considered a victory for the common man over the professional stock-market fatcats. All because Gill liked the stock. Throw your diamond hands in the air! This is the story that Dumb Money wants to tell: a finance-nerd David sling-shooting all those Wall Street Goliaths right in the nuts. For some, the GameStop saga was an insider-baseball game for the day-trading set that somehow became national news. For filmmaker Craig Gillespie ( I, Tonya ) and screenwriters Lauren Shuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo, however, it’s the perfect basis for a slobs-vs.-snobs comedy that’s infused with class-warfare issues and righteous anger. In order to adapt Ben Mezrich’s book The Antisocial Network, which covered the whole shebang from start to finish, they’ve borrowed a mosaic narrative template and the use of an all-star cast as subcultural tour guides from another wonky-to-accessible movie with famous faces. Call this The Big Short Squeeze. Gill ( Paul Dano , in full twitchy hero mode) is still the closest thing there is to a protagonist here, a guy who works as a stock analyst by day and, after he ties on his Karate Kid headband and dons a funky cat T-shirt, becomes an online financial pundit by night. His wife, Caroline ( Shailene Woodley ), is one of several stand-ins for the audience, specifically viewers who couldn’t tell a bear market from a bull market. She supports her husband unconditionally, it seems, but also occasionally asks him, “So how much money did we just make?” for what feels like our benefit. No celebrities break the fourth wall in a bubble bath to explain junk bonds. Still, the filmmakers key in early to the necessary hand-holding by introducing an ensemble of folks via onscreen text, along with their current net worth. Gabe Plotkin ( Seth Rogen ), who runs the hedge fund Melvin Capital, is sitting on billions. A nurse named Jenny ( America Ferrera ), who dabbles in trading, has something close to $500. And so on. Editor’s picks Special Report: Future of Music 2023 The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time The 100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time It’s a smart move, not only to give us a sense of who has what at stake and how much they stand to gain or lose, but by drawing out explicit class lines from the jump. The phrase “dumb money” refers to noninstitutional and/or nonaffiliated investors who nonetheless are grouped together; it’s not a surprise to hear that Wall Street brokers coined the dripping-with-contempt phrase. Gill, along with a host of fictional stand-ins for the Joes and Janes who frequented the Reddit thread “wallstreetbets” and hung on Roaring Kitty’s every video-recorded word, want to reclaim the term. So we’re “dumb” money, huh. OK then. We’ll show you who the idiots are. Cue essential workers like Jenny, retail grunts like Marcus ( Anthony Ramos ), college students like Harmony (Talia Ryder) and Riri ( Industry ‘s Myha’la Herrold), and working-class stiffs like Keith’s knucklehead brother Kevin ( Pete Davidson , stealing scenes like a jewel thief), all banding together to make sure that the little people don’t get screwed over by the big swinging dicks. That group includes Plotkin, fellow hedge fund manager Steve Cohen (Vincent D’Onofrio), Robinhood co-founder Vlad Tenev (Sebastian Stan) and Ken Griffin ( Nick Offerman ), owner of the trading firm Citadel. It helps to remember that all of this took place around early 2021, when the pandemic was still raging, poor people were scrambling to make ends meet, and billionaires were renting out full resorts just so they could play tennis without a mask. No one is questioning who the good guys and the bad guys are here. Trending Chaos, Comedy, and ‘Crying Rooms’: Inside Jimmy Fallon's ‘Tonight Show’ Paul Reubens, Actor Best Known as Pee-wee Herman, Cause of Death Confirmed Kim Kardashian: My Plea to Joe Biden to Stop Another Armenian Genocide Hear the New Jimmy Buffett Song Paul McCartney Says Is His Best Vocal Ever Related ‘Ferrari’ Boasts an Oscar-Worthy Penélope Cruz and Some Very Sexy Cars What Hollywood Strikers Can Learn From the Porn Industry 'Parks and Recreation' Cast, Including L'il Sebastian, Reunite at Actors' Strike Dumb Money never lets you forget which side these respective characters are on, or more importantly, which side it’s on. It knows the game is rigged, and who exactly is rigging it to stay in their favor. The fact that it never quite tips into dumbing this stuff down, yet still manages to translate most everything you need to know in order to understand why those “hold the line” memes in regard to not selling GameStop stock was viewed as an act of social rebellion, is impressive. That it never fully tips into being pure Oscarbait by combining marquee names cracking wise and Important Issues Torn From Recent Headlines may be even more awe-inspiring. There’s both a breeziness to the tone and a sense of rage burbling just underneath the surface, so when we eventually do get to that congressional hearing at the end, you’re still laughing while also resisting the urge to pump your fist. Gillespie and his movie-star cast aren’t trying to short squeeze the topic for statuettes. They’re just laying out what happened, why it happened, and why it mattered in the most audience-friendly manner imaginable, then take the whole thing to the moon. And it’s the lack of pandering in the way that they do it while also drawing clear battle lines that make it a surprisingly safe bet.\",\n",

       "   'content': 'AMES, Iowa — Donald Trump crossed paths with several Republican rivals Saturday as he attended Iowa’s in-state college football grudge match, one of the former president’s few visits so far to the state that holds the first nominating caucus next year. Trump waded into one of the state’s largest sports crowds at Jack Trice Stadium in Ames, where Iowa State was hosting Iowa. Also at the game were Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and several other candidates, putting in face time with Iowa’s elected officials and football fans. With the race entering its traditional ramp-up after Labor Day, Trump has largely skipped holding town halls or participating in many of the state’s cherished campaign traditions, but has not paid a price so far. Trump remains far ahead of DeSantis and other rivals in Iowa and nationally. Trump has made a habit of visiting Iowa on the same day as DeSantis, whom Trump treats as his main threat. Both were in and around the stadium before kickoff, reminiscent of the scene last month when Trump drew huge crowds to the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines while DeSantis addressed smaller audiences and hit the midway rides with his family. Trump on Saturday emerged from the Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity, an agricultural house in the middle of Iowa State’s fraternity and sorority neighborhood, where he met privately with students first, to the cheers of hundreds pressing to get photos with the former president outside the red-brick house. Trump basked in the adoration, pumping his fists to the chants of “Trump, Trump, Trump” and “U.S.A, U.S.A.” before strolling to a grill and raising a spatula holding a hamburger. He stopped to autograph photos and about a dozen footballs, which he tossed, both underhand and overhand, into the crowd of cheering students before departing for the game. During the fraternity scrum, Trump approached a reporter with the Republican-leaning Right Side Broadcasting Network, who asked what he thought of the scene. “I guess the youth likes Trump,” Trump said, straining to be heard above the din of the crowd. Trump endured some targeted hits during the day. As Trump’s motorcade rolled on to the college campus before game time, some football fans walking the streets of Ames to the game made profane gestures as it passed. A prop plane flew over the stadium carrying a banner that read, “Where’s Melania?” And hired performers wearing inflatable costumes, one posing as Trump and the other infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, held hands as they roamed the parking lot in face masks. Meanwhile, DeSantis met fans of both schools at tailgates and said he would be attending the game with Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has not endorsed a candidate but often has appeared with DeSantis and his wife, Casey. “We’re having a good time,” DeSantis said to reporters. “It’s quite an atmosphere, probably a little bit more civilized than the Florida-Georgia game.” As he wandered from one tailgate to another, DeSantis was flanked by fans cheering and waving campaign signs from a booth hosted by the pro-DeSantis Never Back Down super PAC. Volunteers with Iowans for Trump similarly set up several booths around the parking lots, with both teams working to get fans to sign caucus pledge cards. Also appearing before the game were candidates Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor, and Asa Hutchinson, a former Arkansas governor, who greeted each other at a tailgate honoring veterans, where Sen. Joni Ernst camped out for most of the afternoon. Asked who he was rooting for, DeSantis said he wasn’t going to “do anything to upset” Reynolds, who is an Iowa State graduate. Hutchinson said he was rooting for the “underdog because I’m an underdog in this race and I want underdogs to win,” and Burgum noted his North Dakota State Bison were playing today, though he didn’t risk showing up in Ames wearing his gear. While fans Saturday showed up for football, not for politics, voters have had the chance to see most candidates who regularly appear at Iowa cattle calls and meet-and-greets. DeSantis is increasingly focused on winning or placing high in Iowa and says he’s visited more than half of the state’s 99 counties already. Trump, meanwhile, has made only five visits to Iowa this year. At the game, Trump was sitting in a stadium suite with Iowa casino powerhouse Gary Kirke, an influential Republican donor. Instead of large-scale rallies, Trump is relying on state party events that offer large, friendly audiences at no cost to his campaign, while his political organization pays millions of dollars in legal expenses as he faces four criminal indictments. He was in neighboring South Dakota on Friday night appearing at a state party fundraiser with Gov. Kristi Noem, who endorsed him. Trump’s campaign has also used digital outreach. Last week, Trump held a conference call with tens of thousands of Iowans. He has done some in-person events with voters. In June, he handed out Dairy Queen “Blizzards” while also confessing aloud that he did not know what the soft-serve treats were. There is no comparable example in Iowa political history to a former president running to reclaim his old office while also under indictment for more than 90 felony counts. But other high-profile candidates and strong front-runners have done the town halls and retail campaigning for which Iowa and other early primary states are well-known. In 2007, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton entered the race for the 2008 Democratic nomination as a national celebrity and the party’s heavy favorite in national polling. Drawing larger crowds, Clinton sought to meet the demand by holding smaller meetings with local activists before speaking to packed gyms and halls. Clinton also attended party events with her lesser-known rivals to demonstrate her willingness to undergo the rigor that Iowans typically demand. Ultimately, she lost the 2008 caucus to then-Sen. Barack Obama, who eventually won the nomination and the White House. Trump has foregone all but one such event in Iowa this year. The exception was the Iowa Republican Party Lincoln Dinner in July, a marquee event that helps to finance the caucus.',\n",

       "   'content': 'DES MOINES, Iowa — Donald Trump crossed paths with several Republican rivals Saturday as he attended Iowa’s in-state college football grudge match, one of the former president’s few visits so far to the state that holds the first nominating caucus next year. Trump waded into one of the state’s largest sports crowds at Jack Trice Stadium in Ames, where Iowa State was hosting Iowa. Also at the game were Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and several lesser-known candidates. Advertisement With the race entering its traditional ramp-up after Labor Day, Trump has largely skipped holding town halls or participating in many of the state’s cherished campaign traditions, but has not paid a price so far. Trump remains far ahead of DeSantis and other rivals in Iowa and nationally. Trump has made a habit of visiting Iowa on the same day as DeSantis, whom Trump treats as his main threat. Both were in and around the stadium before kickoff, reminiscent of the scene last month when Trump drew huge crowds to Iowa State Fair in Des Moines while DeSantis addressed smaller audiences and hit the midway rides with his family. Advertisement Trump stopped at a fraternity house before the game and came outside to greet cheering students. At one point, he stood in front of a table with a line of footballs arranged between red plastic cups. He picked up each of the balls and threw them into the crowd. DeSantis met fans of both schools at tailgates and he was accompanied by Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has not endorsed a candidate but often has appeared with DeSantis and his wife, Casey. DeSantis said he would go to the game with Reynolds, an Iowa State graduate. “I must say this is a little more civilized than the Florida-Georgia game,” he said. Also appearing at tailgates were candidates Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor, and Asa Hutchinson, a former Arkansas governor, who greeted each other. DeSantis is increasingly focused on winning or placing high in Iowa and says he’s visited more than half of the state’s 99 counties already. Trump, meanwhile, has made only five visits to Iowa this year. Instead of large-scale rallies, Trump is relying on state party events that offer large, friendly audiences at no cost to his campaign, while his political organization pays millions of dollars in legal expenses as he faces four criminal indictments. He was in neighboring South Dakota on Friday night appearing at a state party fundraiser with Gov. Kristi Noem, who endorsed him. Trump’s campaign has also used digital outreach. Last week, Trump held a conference call with tens of thousands of Iowans. He has done some in-person events with voters. In June, he handed out Dairy Queen “Blizzards” while also confessing aloud that he did not know what the soft-serve treats were. There is no comparable example in Iowa political history to a former president running to reclaim his old office while also under indictment for more than 90 felony counts. But other high-profile candidates and strong front-runners have done the town halls and retail campaigning for which Iowa and other early primary states are well-known. Advertisement In 2007, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton entered the race for the 2008 Democratic nomination as a national celebrity and the party’s heavy favorite in national polling. Drawing larger crowds, Clinton sought to meet the demand by holding smaller meetings with local activists before speaking to packed gyms and halls. Clinton also attended party events with her lesser-known rivals to demonstrate her willingness to undergo the rigor that Iowans typically demand. Ultimately, she lost the 2008 caucus to then-Sen. Barack Obama, who eventually won the nomination and the White House. Trump has foregone all but one such event in Iowa this year. The exception was the Iowa Republican Party Lincoln Dinner in July, a marquee event that helps to finance the caucus',\n",

       "   'description': 'President Biden and his allies have outlined plans to create a rail and shipping corridor linking India with the Middle East and ultimately Europe.',\n",
       "   'content': 'President Biden and his allies on Saturday announced plans to build a rail and shipping corridor linking India with the Middle East and Europe, an ambitious project aimed at fostering economic growth and political cooperation . “This is a big deal,” said Biden. “This is a really big deal.” The corridor , outlined at the annual Group of 20 summit of the world’s top economies, would help boost trade, deliver energy resources and improve digital connectivity. It would include India, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Israel and the European Union, said Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security advisor. Sullivan said the network reflected Biden’s vision for “far-reaching investments” that come from “effective American leadership” and a willingness to embrace other nations as partners. He said the enhanced infrastructure would boost economic growth, help bring countries in the Middle East together and establish that region as a hub for economic activity instead of as a “source of challenge, conflict or crisis” as it has been in recent history. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi , European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other leaders from around the world participated in the announcement. “Enhancing connectivity with all regions has been a key priority for India,” said Modi, speaking through an interpreter. “We believe that connectivity is a means to not only increase mutual trade between different countries but also increase mutual trust.” The rail and shipping corridor would help physically tie together a vast stretch of the globe, improving digital connectivity and enabling more trade among countries, including with energy products such as hydrogen. Although White House officials did not set a timeline for its completion, the corridor would provide a physical and ideological alternative to China’s own nation-spanning infrastructure program. The White House gave no details on the project’s cost or financing, though Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman mentioned a figure of $20 billion during the announcement. It was unclear whether that sum applied solely to the Saudi commitment. After the announcement, Biden greeted the crown prince with a hearty handshake , a friendlier exchange than when they last met, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, just over a year ago. At that time, Biden, who had harshly criticized Prince Mohammed over the kingdom’s human rights record, awkwardly greeted him with a fist bump, a moment roundly criticized by rights activists. Von der Leyen described the project as a “green and digital bridge across continents and civilizations.” She added that it includes cables to transmit electricity and data. She also announced a “Trans-African Corridor” connecting the Angolan port of Lobito with landlocked areas of the continent: the Kananga province in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the copper-mining regions of Zambia. Speaking of the African project, Biden called it a “game-changing regional investment” and said “both of these are huge, huge steps forward.” Amos Hochstein, Biden’s coordinator for global infrastructure and energy security, laid out a rough timeline for the project over the next year. In the next 60 days, working groups will put together a fuller plan and set timelines. The first phase will involve identifying the areas that need investment and where physical infrastructure can be connected between countries. Hochstein said the plans can be put into place over the next year so that the project can move onto setting up finances and construction. Sullivan said the project started coming together after Biden visited Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in July 2022, where he emphasized a need for greater regional economic integration. In January, the White House started having conversations with regional partners about the concept. By spring, maps and written assessments of existing rail infrastructure in the Middle East were being drafted. Sullivan, and senior White House aides Hochstein and Brett McGurk, traveled to Saudi Arabia in May to meet with their Indian, Saudi and UAE counterparts. All sides have worked since then to finalize details of the agreement announced Saturday. The parties also brought Israel and Jordan into the project. Saudi Arabia and Israel do not have diplomatic relations, though the White House has been pushing them toward normalizing relations. Sullivan said the transportation project is not seen as a “precursor” to a potential normalization deal but he characterized Israel’s inclusion as “significant.” “The participants in this effort are focused on practical outcomes that deliver for their people,” Sullivan said. “And a corridor of this kind by dint of geography works best having Israel in as opposed to out and the countries participating prioritized that.” Biden participated in both G20 sessions on Saturday. He highlighted plans to push for more investments to address climate change, such as his own domestic incentives to encourage the use of renewable energy. He also argued that Russia’s war in Ukraine is hurting many other nations, which have had to cope with greater food and energy costs as well as higher interest rate costs on their debt. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been a regular presence at international summits, including last year’s G20 in Indonesia, since Russia invaded his country more than 18 months ago, was not invited by Modi’s government to this year’s gathering. Zelensky has used the high-profile gatherings to argue for continued economic and military support for his country. India is one of the most prominent U.S. allies that has largely stayed on the sidelines of the war, and has even dramatically increased its purchases of Russian oil. Jon Finer, the White House principal deputy national security advisor, said the administration pushed for Zelensky’s inclusion at the summit. “Ultimately, it is not our decision,” Finer said. “But you can expect that the United States and our other partners who are working with Ukraine so closely ... We’ll make that case quite forcefully in the context of these conversations.” The summit communique, a joint statement agreed to by all participants, addressed the war, among other issues. It included language underlining the principle that states cannot use force to change borders, disavowed the use of nuclear weapons and called for a just peace based on the principles of the U.N. Charter. The communique also underscored that attacks on civilian infrastructure must end. During the summit, Biden also discussed his request to Congress for additional funding for the World Bank that could generate more than $25 billion in new lending for economic development. The White House more broadly is trying to strengthen the G20 as an international forum, while Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin decided not to attend. Biden has said he was disappointed by Xi’s decision. Asked again about the Chinese leader’s absence, Biden said Saturday that the summit “is going well” though “it would be nice to have him here.”',\n",

       "   'content': 'Social media platforms have long argued that they are simply providers of a public forum in which others comment, and thus should not be held liable for what people say there. Elon Musk has single-handedly blown a massive hole in that bogus argument. A today suggests that Elon Musk has unprecedented control over content moderation, and personally decided to re-platform Kanye West to X, formerly known as Twitter. It also reveals that Musk ordered his team to make his own posts among the platform’s most visible. The report further details how he told his engineers to tweak the feed of his top venture capitalist pal directly at his request — a feature not available to any of the millions of other users of the platform. With these acts of direct editorial control, Musk has made clear his platform is not a neutral “public forum” and should be held to the same rules as any other newspaper, publisher or broadcast network. For over two decades, social media companies have hidden behind the legal protections conferred by . This legislation, passed before social media companies existed, was designed to make the early “interactive” web manageable. It conferred protections on early web and news sites so they did not have to bear legal responsibility for the content posted on bulletin boards or comment sections, even if they engaged in some content moderation. It was a specific law designed before anyone ever imagined a Facebook, Reddit or TikTok. Nearly a decade later, social media took off as a business in earnest — dispensing with original content and turning the aforementioned “comments” into a business. Social media companies aggregate these posts and repackage them into a tailored news feed designed to be as entertaining and addictive as possible. By interspersing advertisements with comments, they monetize these endless newsfeeds. This simple business model has proven hugely lucrative — and has made Mark Zuckerberg a hundred billion dollars in personal wealth. Hate and disinformation have an advantage in this environment. The repackaging, done by artificial intelligence, is designed to benefit the company by being as addictive as possible, exploiting psychological triggers — benefitting content that enrages or makes us want to react by posting more content ourselves. The algorithms are also tailored to promote the owners of these companies and the values, politics and ideas that benefit them the most, as Musk has so explicitly demonstrated through his actions. Others have done the same. For example, Mark Zuckerberg reportedly approved an internal initiative — — to promote positive stories about Facebook. They are unequivocally, therefore, publishing companies, and what the user consumes is a result of decisions taken by executives for their own benefit — economically or politically. And yet thanks to the “get out of jail free” card of Section 230, enacted eight years before Facebook was even started, these companies cannot be held liable as publishers in any way for the hate, antisemitism, and disinformation that they push to billions. No other person or company in America is free from accountability or responsibility for its core product in such a way. It is clear from the research my organization, the Center for Countering Digital Hate, publishes, that social media can be harmful. Extremists openly proselytize, recruit, finance and plan operations on these platforms with little intervention. Algorithms promote dangerous eating disorders and self-harm content to teenagers. Algorithms cross-fertilize conspiracist movements, giving QAnon followers anti-vaxx content and vice versa. Trolling and abuse are rife on these platforms, forcing women, minorities and LGBTQ+ people to restrict their own posts so as to avoid a torrent of abuse. from the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the European Union to talk about how we might develop a set of laws that would allow us to hold these companies accountable. We all agreed that social media companies quite clearly have a significant impact on our psychology, especially that of our children, our communities, our politics and even the values that underpin our democracy. At the end of the conference, we published our STAR Framework, which provided a comprehensive set of minimum standards for an effective regulatory framework that balances free speech with human rights. The framework demands of algorithms, decisions on how companies enforce their “community standards,” and how commercial advertising shapes the content it presents, which would allow for meaningful to the public. It also requires companies to take for avoidable, predictable harms they failed to deal with, which we hope will lead to a culture of . Since that meeting, the , and the United Kingdom is shortly expected to pass an Online Safety Act that seeks to balance corporate rights with human and civil rights. The United States is unique in having failed to do so. It is time Congress stops vacillating and starts acting. Our kids’ mental health and body image, the safety of our communities, the rights of vulnerable and minority groups, and even our democracy itself demand better. Hiding behind the notion that these vast companies are simply “free speech” platforms rather than publishers who shape public knowledge to their agenda is simply untenable in the face of reality. Elon Musk, through his brazen stewardship of X, has ironically, made the best possible case for the STAR Framework than we could ever have done alone.',\n",

The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. \",\n",

       " 'content': 'The IRS announced it will start targeting thousands of uber-wealthy tax cheats and make them poney up hundreds of millions of dollars in the coming months. The federal agency said it plans to aggressively hunt down 1,600 millionaires and 75 large business partnerships that routinely “cut corners” on their taxes. “If you pay your taxes on time it should be particularly frustrating when you see that wealthy filers are not,” IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel said. Each of the millionaire tax dodgers that the IRS set its sights on owes a minimum of at least $250,000 each in back taxes, while the partnerships have assets of roughly $10 billion on average. The IRS is planning to hire an undisclosed number of revenue agents to focus on the high-end collection cases so that the new initiative can start rolling in October this year. The crackdown represents the next phase of an offensive pursuit that the Biden Administration launched earlier this summer — in July, the IRS said it collected $38 million in delinquent taxes from more than 175 high-income taxpayers in the span of a few months. According to Werfel, the initiative is being propelled by a massive boost in federal funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to generate tax revenue for the nation. The agency is also being added by artificial intelligence tools that can detect tax-cheating tactics that might be indiscernible to the human eye. “New tools are helping us see patterns and trends that we could not see before, and as a result, we have higher confidence on where to look and find where large partnerships are shielding income,” Werfel said. A team of academic economists and IRS researchers in 2021 found that the top 1% of U.S. income earners fail to report more than 20% of their earnings to the IRS. With additional support and funding, the IRS will continue to hunt larger and wealthier tax dodgers in the coming years. As part of the initiative, the agency promised that citizens earning less than $400,000 a year will not see an increase in their audit rates. “This new compliance push makes good on the promise of the Inflation Reduction Act to ensure the IRS holds our wealthiest filers accountable to pay the full amount of what they owe,” said Werfel. “The years of underfunding that predated the Inflation Reduction Act led to the lowest audit rate of wealthy filers in our history.” With Post Wires',\n",
