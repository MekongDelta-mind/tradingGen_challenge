        "content": "The IRS announced it will start targeting thousands of uber-wealthy tax cheats and make them poney up hundreds of millions of dollars in the coming months. The federal agency said it plans to aggressively hunt down 1,600 millionaires and 75 large business partnerships that routinely \u201ccut corners\u201d on their taxes. \u201cIf you pay your taxes on time it should be particularly frustrating when you see that wealthy filers are not,\u201d IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel said. Each of the millionaire tax dodgers that the IRS set its sights on owes a minimum of at least $250,000 each in back taxes, while the partnerships have assets of roughly $10 billion on average. The IRS is planning to hire an undisclosed number of revenue agents to focus on the high-end collection cases so that the new initiative can start rolling in October this year. The crackdown represents the next phase of an offensive pursuit that the Biden Administration launched earlier this summer \u2014 in July, the IRS said it collected $38 million in delinquent taxes from more than 175 high-income taxpayers in the span of a few months. According to Werfel, the initiative is being propelled by a massive boost in federal funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to generate tax revenue for the nation. The agency is also being added by artificial intelligence tools that can detect tax-cheating tactics that might be indiscernible to the human eye. \u201cNew tools are helping us see patterns and trends that we could not see before, and as a result, we have higher confidence on where to look and find where large partnerships are shielding income,\u201d Werfel said. A team of academic economists and IRS researchers in 2021 found that the top 1% of U.S. income earners fail to report more than 20% of their earnings to the IRS. With additional support and funding, the IRS will continue to hunt larger and wealthier tax dodgers in the coming years. As part of the initiative, the agency promised that citizens earning less than $400,000 a year will not see an increase in their audit rates. \u201cThis new compliance push makes good on the promise of the Inflation Reduction Act to ensure the IRS holds our wealthiest filers accountable to pay the full amount of what they owe,\u201d said Werfel. \u201cThe years of underfunding that predated the Inflation Reduction Act led to the lowest audit rate of wealthy filers in our history.\u201d With Post Wires",

        "description": "Coco Gauff, 19, is the youngest US Open winner since 17-year-old Serena Williams won her first major in 1999.",
        "content": "NEW YORK -- Coco Gauff won her first major title on Saturday at the US Open with a 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 victory over Aryna Sabalenka in front of an adoring crowd under the roof on a stormy day at Arthur Ashe Stadium. After the match, the 19-year-old American fell to the ground and lay on her back on the court before sobbing in celebration. After hugging Sabalenka, Gauff ran up the stairs to tearfully hug her parents and then the rest of her team. Moments later, Gauff told the star-studded crowd, which included Kevin Durant, Diane Keaton, Nicole Kidman, Spike Lee, Mindy Kaling and 2006 champion Maria Sharapova, that she still hadn't fully processed the victory. \"Oh my goodness, it means so much to me,\" Gauff told ESPN's Mary Joe Fernandez. \"I feel like I'm a little bit in shock in this moment. That [2022] French Open loss was a heartbreak for me. But I realized God put you through tribulations and trials and that makes this moment even sweeter than I could have imagined.\" After the match, several high-profile celebrities, including former President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and President Joe Biden, sent her congratulatory messages over social media. Gauff is the youngest American to win the US Open since Serena Williams in 1999 and the first American player to win a major title since Sofia Kenin at the Australian Open in 2020. Gauff also became the first woman to win the title in New York after dropping the first set in three matches during her title run since Williams, also in 1999. When speaking to the media after the match, Gauff said it was an honor to have her name listed on the same trophy as Williams and her sister Venus, who won the title a combined eight times. \"I mean, they're the reason why I have this trophy today, to be honest,\" Gauff said. \"They have allowed me to believe in this dream. Growing up, there weren't too many Black tennis players dominating the sport. It was literally, at that time when I was younger, it was just them that I can remember. \"Obviously more came because of their legacy, so it made the dream more believable. But all the things that they had to go through, they made it easier for someone like me to do this.\" Gauff, the tournament's No. 6 seed, was broken in the first game of the match and struggled to find any rhythm in the nervy 40-minute opening set. Since the first set winner had won 27 of the previous 28 US Open women's finals, history was not on her side. But she took control in the second set, breaking Sabalenka in the fourth game and recording an 81% win percentage on first serve. Her confidence grew with every point, and her \"Come on!\" screams and fist pumps became increasingly more animated. In the deciding set, it was all Gauff. She jumped to a 4-0 lead and withheld Sabalenka's last-ditch efforts and a medical timeout at 4-1. After two hours and six minutes, Gauff was the US Open champion. \"You played unbelievable,\" Sabalenka said to Gauff during the on-court trophy ceremony. \"Congrats to you and your team, you guys deserve this title. Many more to come, I'm pretty sure.\" Despite still being a teenager, Gauff has been one of the sport's most recognizable stars since she burst onto the scene at Wimbledon in 2019 and reached the fourth round as a 15-year-old qualifier. Since then, she's won five WTA titles and reached the final at the 2022 French Open. With several high-profile sponsorship deals and a growing presence on social media, Gauff has remained under the spotlight and the expectations for her career have continued to increase. On Saturday, Gauff said the pressure has been overwhelming at times, and she felt she was expected to immediately win a major title after her run to the fourth round at Wimbledon in 2019. \"It's been difficult,\" she said. \"I mean, it's been a long journey to this point. I wasn't a fully developed player, and I still think I have a lot of development to go. At that moment, I think people were putting a lot of pressure on me to win. I felt that at 15 I had to win a Slam at 15. \"I think that was, you know, not the mistake, because everything led to this moment so there were no mistakes, but that was a little bit of the pressure that I was feeling. Now I just realize that I just need to go out there and try my best.\" After losing in the first round at Wimbledon in July, Gauff brought in a new team, including coach Pere Riba and consultant Brad Gilbert. Since then, she's won the titles in Washington D.C., and Cincinnati and is 18-1 during the current hard-court swing. She defeated two Grand Slam champions en route to the final, as well as 2023 French Open runner-up Karolina Muchova in the semifinals. Gauff told the crowd she had been motivated by those who had doubted her. \"I want to say honestly thank you to the people who didn't believe in me,\" Gauff said. \"A month ago, I won a 500 title and people said, I would stop at that. Two weeks ago, I won a 1000 title and people were saying that was the biggest it was going to get. So three weeks later, I'm here with this trophy right now. \"I've tried my best to carry this with grace and I've been doing my best. So honestly, to those who thought they were putting water on my fire, you were really adding gas to it. And now I'm really burning so bright right now.\" Gauff later told reporters she had been reading comments online from those who didn't think she was going to win right up until the match. In addition to earning $3 million for the victory -- something she thanked Billie Jean King for fighting for as she received it -- Gauff will improve to a career-high ranking of No. 3 on Monday. Sabalenka, the reigning Australian Open champion, will take over the No. 1 ranking for the first time despite the loss. Gauff will also return to the top spot in the doubles ranking, alongside partner Jessica Pegula. The pair reached the quarterfinals at the US Open.",

        "content": "A new Utah Foundation report affirms the more postsecondary education a person has, there\u2019s a better return on investment. But the report, titled \u201cBang for your buck: Which Utah schools have the best return on investment,\u201d also indicates much depends on what a student studies and the workforce demand for those credentials. The report, which examined return on investment at Utah\u2019s public and private colleges and universities, found Weber State University is tops for students\u2019 10-year net present value of their education. This was calculated by how much a certain sum of money \u2014 in this case, the future earnings of additional education minus the cost of that education \u2014 would be worth today. The report shows that the first-year returns of graduates of some Weber State University associate degree programs \u2014 computer science, industrial production technologies, nursing and allied health professions \u2014 outstrip the median bachelor\u2019s degree programs. Graduates of Weber State\u2019s manufacturing engineering technology associate degree program \u2014 its plastics and composites concentration, for one \u2014 experience first-year median returns of nearly $69,000, according to the report. The median return on investment for those who earn associate degrees in computer science from Weber State is $58,224 and $48,672 for nursing. Nursing students Kalley Jaques and Aisha Holts work on a central line change as students work in the simulation lab in the Marriott Health Building at Weber State University in Ogden on Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2023. Scott G Winterton, Deseret News \u201cBachelor\u2019s degrees in Utah are more likely to pay off in the longer run \u2014 though Weber State University defies this trend. The most common credential from Weber State University is an associate\u2019s degree, though they also offer certifications and bachelor\u2019s degrees,\u201d the report states. The university also offers a wide array of graduate degree programs, including a doctorate of nursing practice and a physician assistant program. Weber State University Provost Ravi Krovi said the report was welcome news to administrators and educators striving to offer programs that meet workforce needs and help graduates earn higher wages. \u201cWe were thrilled but we\u2019re not altogether surprised. It\u2019s sort of validating, quite honestly. We certainly want to tell our story but when you have data which comes in and proves it, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s even better,\u201d he said. Krovi said Weber State University has made \u201ca conscious attempt to really focus on cost from a tuition and fees perspective. Our tuition and fees have not gone up that much. If you go back to the last 10 years, it\u2019s less than the overall increase in the consumer price index.\u201d The university has made guided pathways a priority, too, he said. \u201cAs students come in, we try to give them a better perspective of what are the options and so I think it\u2019s one thing to give advice, but it\u2019s also important to have the right type of programming. Stackable programs really help us from that standpoint,\u201d he said. A student might come to Weber State with the goal of earning a certificate, which are short-term programs. Once they grow accustomed to the college experience, the hope is they will feel more comfortable and confident about seeking an associate degree or even a bachelor\u2019s degree, he said. \u201cThat transition and transfer is a lot more seamless because it\u2019s all our curriculum, our program. So I think that mission, the dual mission for us, is really helpful for students,\u201d Krovi said. Nursing student Whitney Weston works out a few mathematical problems as she and other students go about their work in the simulation lab in the Marriott Health Building at Weber State University in Ogden on Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2023. Scott G Winterton, Deseret News The report also notes Salt Lake Community College\u2019s large variety of associate degrees. Its computer and information sciences program, for example, \u201chas a first-year return on investment of a whopping $53,628,\u201d the report states. Associate degrees with the highest median earnings include engineering and architecture. Median earnings are also higher than average for public safety, nursing, construction and manufacturing, business and agriculture degrees, according to the report. The report also found that the private, for-profit Neumont College of Computer Science had the highest ranked 40-year net present value of any college in Utah, followed by Brigham Young University, the University of Utah, Weber State and Westminster University. The report explores the financial return on investment for education beyond high school \u2014 or whether pursuing certificates, certification, associate degrees and bachelor\u2019s degrees make financial sense. \u201cResearch suggests that the return on investment for education beyond high school is generally worth the time and effort,\u201d the report states. But degree selection and workforce and industry needs can make a difference. According to the report, more than a quarter of those with associate degrees earn more than the median bachelor\u2019s degree wage and 35% of those with bachelor\u2019s degrees earn more than the median master\u2019s degree wage.

        "description": "Week Ahead 11th-15th SeptemberMON: Norwegian CPI (Aug)TUE: EIA STEO, OPEC MOMR; Swedish Unemployment (Aug), UK Unemployment (Aug) & Wages (Jul), NorwegianGDP (Jul), Germany/EZ ZEW (Sep)WED: IEA OMR; UK GDP Estimate (Jul), US CPI (Aug)THU: ECB Policy Announcement, Norges Bank Regional Network; Australian Employment (Aug), Swedish CPIF (Aug),US Retail Sales (Aug), IJC (w/e 4th Sep), New Zealand Manufacturing PMI (Aug)FRI: Quad Witching, CBR Policy Announcement, ECB TLTRO Repayment Publication; Chinese Industrial Output/Production, Retail Sales, House Prices (Aug), EZ Trade Balance (Jul), US Export/Import Prices (Aug), IndustrialProduction (Aug), NY Fed Manufacturing (Sep), Uni. of Michigan Prelim. (Sep)NOTE: Previews are listed in day orderNORWEGIAN CPI (MON): The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced.UK UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES (TUE): Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end.UK GDP ESTIMATE (WED): A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought.US CPI (WED): Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern.ECB ANNOUNCEMENT (THU): 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%.AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYMENT (THU): participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms.SWEDISH CPIF (THU): July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak.US RETAIL SALES (THU): Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July. While the data set will offer a glimpse on the health of the consumer amid concerns that the economy may slow significantly in the months ahead, traders will also be watching the University of Michigan's prelim survey release due Friday, where the rise in energy prices is likely to have weighed on sentiment.CHINESE ACTIVITY DATA (FRI): Retail sales Y/Y in August are expected to rise by 2.8% (prev. 2.5%), whilst there is currently no consensus for Industrial Production metrics. The data will be closely watched to diagnose the health of the world\u2019s second-larger economy and to gauge the drip-feed of stimulus seen over recent weeks. Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d.This article originally appeared on Newsquawk This article was written by Newsquawk Analysis at www.forexlive.com.",

        "content": "Zhang Xin, the renowned Chinese entrepreneur who used her love of architecture and brilliant business acumen to reshape Beijing and Shanghai\u2019s skyline, has turned her attention to a new challenge: film producer. In September 2022, the billionaire businesswoman \u2014 who spent her teenage years working in Hong Kong garment and electronics factories \u2014 resigned as CEO of SOHO China, one of the world\u2019s preeminent real estate companies she built with her husband, and took up permanent residence in New York City. Zhang will celebrate the one-year anniversary of leaving SOHO at the 2023 Toronto Film Festival , where the Manhattan-based Closer Media, the startup indie production and financing venture she runs with veteran indie producer William Horberg, has no fewer than three films screening. Horberg\u2019s numerous credits include The Queen\u2019s Gambit and The Kite Runner . Their Toronto lineup includes the Tony Goldwyn-directed Ezra , a dramedy about an autistic 11-year-old who embarks on a road trip with his father. Newcomer William Fitzgerald, who himself is autistic, stars in the titular role opposite Bobby Cannavale, Robert De Niro, Rose Byrne, Vera Farmiga and Whoopi Goldberg. Then there\u2019s The Monk and the Gun from Oscar-nominated Bhutanese writer-director Pawo Choyning Dorji. His new film \u2014 which sparked immediate awards buzz upon screening at the Telluride Film Festival ahead of Toronto \u2014 charts the Kingdom of Bhutan\u2019s transition to democracy in the early 2000s in a parable about embracing modernity without disregarding the past. Zhang and Horberg are also investing heavily in documentaries. Their third Toronto entry is Alex Gibney\u2019s In Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simon . Closer is also among the backers of Gibney\u2019s highly anticipated Elon Musk documentary Musk alongside Anonymous Content and Black Bear (HBO won a bidding war for North American rights). And the Gibney connection doesn\u2019t end there. Closer has a stake in acclaimed Haitian filmmaker Raoul Paul\u2019s upcoming feature-length doc Orwell , which will be distributed in North America by Neon. Gibney\u2019s Jigsaw Productions is among the producers of Paul\u2019s film about the legendary George Orwell. (Paul\u2019s 2016 film I Am Not Your Negro earned an Oscar nomination for best documentary feature). Horberg and Zhang, who work out of Midtown Manhattan office space, spoke with The Hollywood Reporter on the eve of Toronto about meeting for the first time and how they are looking to take part in the content revolution by working with established and emerging filmmakers from around the world. Xin, when you stepped down from SOHO, it was reported that you wanted to pursue being a patron of the arts. Are you also looking for a business return from your investment in Closer Media? Zhang I\u2019ve always wanted both, just like when I was a developer. I love art, I love architecture. I always believed you can bring the highest quality of architecture to any building you build. I worked with really the most avant-garde architects, like Zaha Hadid. I of course also wanted to make money. A film can be the same. It\u2019s a business, but I also want to make the highest-quality movies. If there\u2019s one film that does both, it will be a dream come true, right? Horberg I\u2019ve been doing this for many decades. When I was introduced to Xin, my clear takeaway after spending a couple of hours with her \u2014 I\u2019ve worked with many other high-net-worth individuals \u2014 was that this person is a producer at heart. The process of going from a concept to a fully executed plan is very analogous to being a film producer. The reason we were able to quickly join forces is because we spoke the same language. Working with the best architects in the world is not unlike working with the best filmmakers. You\u2019re managing egos and artists and trying to bring out the best, but get them to play within a certain sandbox. How do you think the strike is going to impact the fall film festivals? Horberg I think people are going to turn out because they\u2019re movie lovers, and I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of energy and a lot of excitement around the premiere of all these films. There\u2019s many directors-actors who are attending TIFF , including Tony [Goldwyn]. Our young lead actor in Ezra is a 12-year-old boy with autism, and he and his parents are going to attend, but he is not going to do anything public-facing. It is such a special event for him and his family, and we didn\u2019t want them to miss it. Does Tony Goldwyn have personal experience with autism? Horberg Yes. Tony is a lifelong best friend of Tony Spiridakis, the screenwriter. This is a very semi-autobiographical script. Tony [Spiridakis] is the father of two boys who are on the spectrum. They\u2019re both in their late 20s now, and Tony has known them since birth. All of us were drawn to the authenticity of the script and its honesty and rawness. Tony can\u2019t do press because of the WGA strike, but he will certainly be in Toronto. Zhang We\u2019re very proud to have made this movie. The film\u2019s purpose is to tell a story the world needs to know. Ezra was originally titled Inappropriate Behavior . Why the change? Horberg It had a double meaning, which is always good. You meet this boy who\u2019s in crisis in his school and at home. And so, your immediate perception is that it\u2019s a kid who\u2019s behaving inappropriately. But over the course of the movie your consciousness is raised, and by the end of it, you come to see that he\u2019s the truth teller in the story, and it\u2019s the adults who really need to wake up to their own inappropriate behaviors. But \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d has #MeToo connotations. We ultimately felt, why carry that baggage? The movie has nothing to do with that. We all agreed to change the title and it was Bob De Niro \u2014 God bless him \u2014 who said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just call the movie Ezra ? The kid is so great.\u201d Bob is a savant. He doesn\u2019t say that much, but when he speaks, you really pay attention. How hard was it to get Paul Simon to sign up for Alex Gibney\u2019s documentary? Horberg Alex Gibney\u2019s the master, but it even took the master a year. But once that happened, Paul was all in. The film goes all the way back to him at 10 years old meeting Art Garfunkel in Queens. Considering the world you\u2019ve inhabited, Xin, what do you think of Elon Musk? Zhang He\u2019s a fascinating character. He\u2019s clearly someone who has incredible talent to have created and built Tesla. That\u2019s not a small feat. But he\u2019s also someone who has, at the same time, created a cult following. It\u2019s very important for a filmmaker like Alex Gibney, who is a clear-minded and investigative journalist, to take an objective look at Elon Musk. I met Alex about two years go and really like his work, so he started bringing things to me. Elon Musk is someone he and I talked about. What are among the secrets to your early success? Zhang I think our company will be defined by being very international . Horberg Our director, Pawo Choyning Dorji, was nominated for an Oscar for best international feature for his previous movie, Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom . He\u2019s the first Bhutanese filmmaker ever recognized for his work in that way. Zhang Another thing we did deliberately was to build relationships within the indie film community by reaching out to production and sales companies about doing projects together. CAA is selling Ezra , while UTA, along with Altitude, is selling the Paul Simon film. A wonderful European sales agent, Films Boutique, is behind our Bhutanese film. And we have two movies with Anonymous Content [ In Restless Dreams , Orwell ], and we also have films with Black Bear Pictures [ Musk ] and Wayfarer [ Ezra ]. Who else am I missing? Horberg We\u2019re also doing stuff with Film4 and Participant. What was it like learning that all three films were accepted into Toronto? Horberg We\u2019re thrilled. I\u2019ve been going to Toronto for 25 or 30 years, and it\u2019s the best audience anywhere. I made the film Heaven with Tom Tykwer, the German director, that starred Cate Blanchett. It was screening on a Sunday morning, and Tom and I were running over to get to the theater, and there was a line of 900 people. I thought, \u201cGod, this is like a cinema heaven.\u201d Zhang I did not know how big of a deal it was until Bill said, \u201cThis is 100 percent hit rate. You should be very happy with this.\u201d It just made me feel so proud as someone who went to TIFF for the first time last year to just watch films. Now we have three films playing there.",

        "description": "Online gig work is growing globally and creating an important source of employment for women and young people in poorer countries where jobs are scarce.",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Online gig work is growing globally, particularly in the developing world, creating an important source of employment for women and young people in poorer countries where jobs are scarce, according to a new World Bank report. The report estimates the number of global online gig workers at as many as 435 million people and says demand for gig work increased 41% between 2016 and the first quarter of 2023. That boost is generating concern, though, among worker rights advocates about the lack of strong job protections in the gig economy, where people work job to job with little security and few employment rights. While location-based gig services such as Uber, Lyft and TaskRabbit require labor like moving and delivery, online gig assignments can be largely done at home. Tasks include image tagging, data entry, website design and software development. For women in the developing world, \u201cthere aren\u2019t enough opportunities and they really struggle to get good quality jobs because of constraints and household responsibilities,\u201d said Namita Datta, lead author of the World Bank report, released Thursday. She said online gig work provides women and underprivileged youth \u201ca very interesting opportunity to participate in the labor market.\u201d Roughly 90% of low-income countries\u2019 workforce is in the informal sector, according to the report. Worker advocates stress the precariousness of gig work and the lack of job security, accountability from management and other social protections to workers' health and retirement. \u201cThe economic conditions in developing countries are different from the U.S., but one thing that is universal is the importance of developing and prioritizing good jobs \u2014 with a basic minimum wage and basic labor standards,\" said Sharon Block, executive director of Harvard Law School\u2019s Center for Labor and a Just Economy. \u201dThere might be different pathways and timelines of getting there, but that's a universal value.\u201d The report outlines how social insurance coverage is low among gig workers globally. Roughly half of the surveyed gig workers did not have a retirement plan and as much as 73% of Venezuelan gig workers and 75% of Nigerians did not have any savings for retirement. Lindsey Cameron, a management professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said \u201cbecause there are so few options available to workers in these developing nations,\u201d online gigs \u2014 with or without social protections \u2014 were better than no job options for many workers. \u201cAnd since workers are economically dependent on this work, and they don\u2019t have any sort of basic protections, that\u2019s what is ultimately exploitive. The odds are always in the platform\u2019s favor, never the workers favor.\u201d In the United States, gig workers, both online and onsite, represent a growing portion of the workforce and there is ongoing contention about worker rights on these platforms. A 2021 Pew Research study, the latest available, shows that 16% of U.S. adults have earned money through an online gig platform, and 30% of 18- to 29-year-olds have done so. Transportation and delivery companies Uber, Lyft, and Grubhub have been entangled in dozens of lawsuits over minimum wage, employment classification and alleged sexual harassment. \u201cRight now, there are too many jobs where workers are misclassified,\u201d Block said. \u201cWhich means many workers are not guaranteed minimum wage, do not have a social safety net, they don't get unemployment, or workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d \u201cNow some states have stepped in to mandate paid leave, but if you don't live in one of those states, you have to play the good boss lottery.\u201d The World Bank report was based on surveys across 17 countries, including Egypt, Argentina, Nigeria, Russia and China.",

        "content": "As opposed to initial reports of the transaction, the New England Patriots have not waived backup quarterback Matt Corral off their 53-man roster. Instead, moving him to the exempt/left squad list opened the door for Bailey Zappe to move onto the active team again. This story below has been updated to reflect that change. The New England Patriots decided to make yet another change at their backup quarterback position. Bailey Zappe was signed to the 53-man roster on the eve of the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles , with Matt Corral getting sent to the exempt/left squad list in a follow-up move. The transaction doesn\u2019t change the head count on the Patriots\u2019 active roster, but it has an impact on the team nonetheless. Let\u2019s analyze what that impact looks like. Bailey Zappe is QB2 after all: Zappe entered his 2023 sophomore campaign as the nominal No. 2 quarterback on the Patriots\u2019 depth chart behind starter Mac Jones. Despite no other QB seriously challenging his standing over the summer, he still was waived ahead of the roster cutdown deadline in late August \u2014 a sign that the team was looking to upgrade the backup position behind Jones. Matt Corral, who was claimed off waivers the next day, appeared to be a possible answer. With Corral now off the team himself, Zappe has returned to the role he held down the stretch in 2022 and throughout this year\u2019s training camp and preseason. Matt Corral is still with the Patriots, sort of: The Patriots were the only team to put in a waiver claim on Corral, picking him up after the Carolina Panthers parted ways with him. Now, he is off New England\u2019s 53-man roster as well, albeit under different circumstances. Why exactly Corral left the team \u2014 he was not spotted during Friday\u2019s practice \u2014 is not known at this time. What we do know, however, is that he technically remains with the Patriots: they will continue holding the rights on the contract they claimed. That means that once/if he returns he would do so in New England. Corral is still getting paid for this week: Even though Corral was moved off the 53-man roster before this week\u2019s game against the Eagles, the NFL-NFLPA Collective Bargaining Agreement ensures that he will still be paid as if on the team on Sunday. This means that he earned 1/18th of his $870,000 base salary, or $48,333. Zappe gets a significant pay increase: Speaking of player compensation, Zappe moving from the practice squad to the active roster will also change his own salary. After being on a $12,000-per-week deal as part of the developmental squad, he will now earn $48,333 for each week spent on New England\u2019s 53-man roster \u2014 an increase of more than 300 percent. New England has three-ish quarterbacks signed now: With Corral no longer part of the equation, the Patriots\u2019 quarterback depth chart is down to Mac Jones and Bailey Zappe. The team does have a third passer on its practice squad, though: Malik Cunningham, who joined the organization as an undrafted rookie free agent earlier this year. While Cunningham had a record-breaking career as a dual-threat quarterback at Louisville, the Patriots opted to use him differently since his arrival. He has seen most of his practice reps and preseason snaps at the wide receiver position. Nonetheless, if push came to show, he would still appear to figure into the quarterback mix to some degree. Both game-day elevation spots remain in play for Sunday: Heading into the weekend, there was a belief that the Patriots might still use Bailey Zappe as their No. 2 behind Mac Jones against the Eagles; Matt Corral\u2019s lack of experience meant that he was no lock to be the only quarterback on the game day roster. To achieve that, the Patriots would have used one of their two standard elevation spots to move Zappe up from the practice squad. With Zappe now instead replacing Corral on the 53-man team, they likely have no need to elevate another passer \u2014 i.e. the aforementioned Malik Cunningham \u2014 for that particular game. As a result, New England still has both spots available. It seems likely that at least one of them will be used on a running back (either Ty Montgomery or Kevin Harris). A spot on the practice squad has opened up: With Zappe headed to the active roster, and Corral to the exempt/left squad list, the Patriots\u2019 roster continues to stand at a full 53. The practice squad, on the other hand, is down to 15 players meaning that one spot is now open. How it will be filled remains to be seen.",

        "content": "A Note From Louis: Over the past year, Luke Lango and his team have covertly developed what our executives are internally calling \u201cthe biggest and boldest initiative ever launched in InvestorPlace history.\u201d This initiative uses artificial intelligence to pick the best breakout stocks. Specifically, they have created an AI-powered algorithmic trading system that their research shows can consistently crush the market. Their \u201c Prometheus \u201d system doesn\u2019t tell us the best AI stocks to buy. Instead, it uses AI to pick the best stocks ripe for a price breakout. And now Luke and his team are ready to debut their AI system to the public. They\u2019re doing so during a special video demo on Tuesday, September 12, at 7 p.m. Eastern. You can click here now to reserve your spot . Meanwhile, I\u2019ve invited Luke to share a bit more about his new AI system with you folks. Here he is\u2026 ********* Imagine knowing, with a quantified measure of certainty, that a stock will either go up or down significantly over the next few weeks. I\u2019m sure it would make a world of difference for your investment strategy. Prometheus provides that certainty. It\u2019s an AI system trained on hundreds of thousands of financial market data points. And its singular goal is to pinpoint the exact moment a stock is ready to surge higher. It leverages more than 50 technical and fundamental factors to tailor AI models for every applicable stock in the market. And it uses that data to ascertain the probability for a major breakout in a stock over the next month. That is, Prometheus scans the entire stock market every week, and then uses that timely data to gauge the probability that a given stock will surge higher in price over the next few weeks. The higher the score, the more likely the stock is to surge over the next month. The lower the score, the less likely. Sounds awesome, right? Over and over, we\u2019ve back-tested this model\u2026 and it has produced stunning results. Just a few weeks ago, we also started using it in real time. And it helped us find one stock that has since popped more than 50% in just a week! Point being: Prometheus works. It is an absolute game-changer. And on Tuesday night, my team and I will debut Prometheus to the public for the very first time ( you can sign up for our event by going here ). But before we do, we must first explain why Prometheus is such a strong system and, more broadly, why using AI makes so much sense when it comes to picking stocks\u2026 AI Is All About the Data When it comes to AI, it\u2019s all about the data . At its essence, artificial intelligence is a collection of machine learning algorithms that parse through and learn from various data points. The more data you give those \u201calgos,\u201d the better the AI becomes. Specifically, AI needs the so-called \u201c4 V\u2019s\u201d of data to be a robust tool: volume, variety, velocity, and veracity . AI needs a lot of data (volume), different types of data (variety), a constant flow of data (velocity), and accurate data (veracity). You throw a bunch of high-volume, high-variety, high-velocity, and high-veracity data at an AI model, and that model will kick butt and take names. And the financial markets provide exactly that. Every single weekday, from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern, the U.S. stock market is open. It\u2019s taking buy orders, sell orders, options contracts, and more \u2013 billions of them, every single day. The average daily volume across the Nasdaq Composite index is 5 billion shares. That\u2019s 5 billion buy and sell transactions a day \u2013 5 billion data points for Prometheus to train on every single day. And each one of those data points leads to a whole host of others. For example, every time a stock changes in price, even by just a penny, it produces entirely new relative strength index ( RSI ) data points, moving average data points, McClellan Oscillator data points, etc. Every time a stock moves, it generates more than 50 alternative data points through all the technical indicators associated with it. That\u2019s more than 50 alternative data points for each of the 5 billion data points the Nasdaq Composite generates every single day. That means, across the Nasdaq alone, the stock market generates more than 250 billion data points across thousands of stocks. Talk about volume, variety, velocity, and veracity. Start Driving Profits With AI Now As the old saying goes, people speak with their dollars. That makes the stock market a utopia for training AI models. This is why we\u2019re already seeing some of the smartest folks on Wall Street deploy advanced AI models to make money in the markets. For example, major firm Voya Investment Management is actively using AI models to help craft strategies across stocks, bonds, and more. Those models are doing exceptionally well. As of June, they were beating the S&P 500 by about 2:1. I\u2019m confident that within five years every major investment firm on Wall Street, every professional trader, and every hedge fund, mutual fund, and family office will be using AI to pick stocks. Those who do not adopt an AI-powered investment strategy will get left behind\u2026 Perhaps permanently. So, if you want to be on the winning side of the market, join us Tuesday evening , September 12, at 7 p.m. Eastern . That\u2019s when we unveil our new AI-powered Prometheus trading system for the very first time. It\u2019ll mark a huge step in your journey toward turning AI into your ultimate advantage \u2013 your ultimate tool for creating wealth in this new economy. If you want to start getting in front of stocks before they jump 100% or more with near-mathematical-precision\u2026 Then sign up for my video demo next week by clicking here. We\u2019ll see you there! Sincerely, Luke Lango Editor, Hypergrowth Investing",

The remaining rates are then ranked, and the median rate becomes the LPR. This article was written by Eamonn Sheridan at www.forexlive.com.",

Officially reported inflation numbers are not high and not a concern for the People's Bank of China. If the Bank wishes to ease policy further inflation rates won't stand in the way. The next MLF is due on the 15th, the LPR setting follows on the 20th. --- The PBOC's MLF rate is a benchmark interest rate that banks in China can use to borrow funds from the People's Bank of China for a period of 6 months to 1 year, medium-term liquidity to commercial banks. The rate is typically announced on the 15th of each month. The interest rate on the MLF loans is typically higher than the benchmark lending rate (more on these below), which encourages banks to use the facility only when they face a shortage of funds. MLF loans are secured by collateral, which can be a wide range of assets including bonds, stocks, and other financial instruments. The collateral ensures that the PBOC can recover the funds if the borrower defaults on the loan. The MLF rate sets the scene for the monthly Loan Prime Rate (LPR) setting. Current LPR rates are: The PBOC's Loan Prime Rate (LPR)",

Energy is the one safe haven in September so far. In between earnings season, the market defaults to economic data for guidance and how that may impact earnings estimates. Right now what the bond market does is leading stocks, by being a vote on inflation trends that will drive the Fed\u2019s monetary moves. This week we\u2019ve watched the US 10yr go from below 4.20% to above 4.30%, and today back to just above 4.21% this morning. Stocks have generally followed these moves, though have taken more heat than bonds moves as the volatility on top of the cautious consideration of the weak seasonality of September has created more sellers than buyers. As of Friday morning, for the first 5 trading days of September we find the Dow down 0.9%, the S&P down 1.25%, both the NASDAQ and QQQ down 1.5%, with the Russell 2000 bringing up the rear at down 3.3%. The bias is to bigger, higher quality companies, though the megatech have certainly revealed they too react to interest rates. Things would be better without the noise in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has seen its worst worst back-to-back losses in almost 3 years on the news about China instructing government employees to not bring an iPhone to work. This has wiped out $200B in market value, though it is bouncing this morning, up 1.3% and still up 43.5% YTD. Energy prices are up again, with crude back over $87.50 and the XLE up 3% in September. Looking forward to next week, we\u2019ll get the CPI data on Wednesday, with forecasts for the headline to be higher and core to be flat. PPI rolls out Thursday and has the same trends expected in the forecasts. Importantly, have fallen to almost zero increase y-o-y, despite 94% occupancy rates, due to massive new supply, a 50-year high, and will be phased in over the months ahead putting downward pressure on inflation stats. Expectations are almost a consensus that the Fed will skip an increase on September 20th, so the tea leaf reading is not nearly as important as it would be if a Fed increase was a real possibility. Recession fears continue to ebb and earnings estimates remain firm or inching higher. With weakness continuing in , and Europe appearing headed for a recession, the US should continue to see investment flows coming our way, and help us get to the 4th quarter without too much further damage.

        "description": "Monday:ECB\u2019s Wunsch (hawk \u2013 non voter) remains in favour of raising interest rates again:Underlying inflation remains persistent, may need more rate hikes.I\u2019m inclined to say we maybe need to do a little bit more.The idea that we\u2019ll have to come to a pause at a certain point can\u2019t be excluded, but it\u2019s too early to talk about stopping hiking completely.The Switzerland Q2 GDP missed expectations as the monetary tightening is starting to bite more heavily:GDP Q2 0.0% vs. 0.1% expected and 0.3% prior. ECB\u2019s Lagarde (hawk \u2013 voter) is focused on the inflation expectations and keeping them in check:It is exactly when people are paying most attention that central banks should deliver their key communication to ensure that those expectations remain firmly anchored.It will be critical for central banks to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored while these relative price changes play out.Tuesday:Chinese Caixin Services PMI missed expectations by a big margin although remaining in expansion:Services PMI 51.8 vs. 53.6 expected and 54.1 prior.The RBA left the cash rate unchanged as expected at 4.10%: Inflation in Australia has passed its peak. But inflation is still too high and will remain so for some time yet.The Australian economy is experiencing a period of below-trend growth. Returning inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe remains the priority. There are significant uncertainties around the outlook.Services price inflation has been surprisingly persistent overseas and the same could occur in Australia.Some further tightening of monetary policy may be required.Will continue to pay close attention to developments in the global economy, trends in household spending, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market.ECB\u2019s Lane (dove \u2013 voter) didn\u2019t offer much in terms of forward guidance:August inflation data is welcome, but we need to see that continue.We do expect bumpiness in easing of energy, food inflation.Easing in services inflation helps limit narrative that tourism is keeping services inflation high.The Eurozone July PPI beat expectations, but the figures were still all negative:PPI M/M -0.5% vs. -0.6% expected and -0.4% prior.PPI Y/Y -7.6% vs. -7.6% expected and -3.4% prior. ECB\u2019s Schnabel (hawk \u2013 voter) touched on climate change and how it could bring downside tail risks:Climate change is an existential threat with large downside tail risks.Climate-related and environmental risks (C&E risks) are now an important focal point for supervisors.Climate change constitutes an existential threat, implying large downside tail risks.Dealing with financial risks is the core of prudential supervision. Physical climate risks tend to be correlated globally.The economic consequences of physical climate risks could be mitigated by closing the large climate insurance protection gap.In the EU, only a quarter of losses caused by climate-related catastrophes are insured.Fed\u2019s Waller (hawk \u2013 voter) changed his stance and he\u2019s now leaning towards a pause:I would say the risks to doing too much and too little are balanced.The data last week clearly showed the jobs market is starting to soften. Unemployment is about where it was a year ago, so change isn't that big.Recessions are often caused by shocks that come out of nowhere, but the data so far is pretty good (for a soft landing).I want to be very careful to say that 'we've done the job'.I want to see 'a couple months' of data.I don't think one more hike would send the economy into a recession.Data will drive whether the Fed hikes again.Recent data will allow the Fed to proceed carefully.We're starting to see the economy slow down.Treasury yields are about where they should be.The US economy is 'about 80% closed' so impacts from abroad will be smaller than for others.We've been keeping a very close eye on commercial real estate, will continue to roll over during the next 2 years or so.We're not sure about what prices CRE will be trading at in two years.Saudi Arabia announced that it would extend the voluntary 1 million barrels per day output cut through December and Russia quickly followed by saying it was cutting exports by 300k bpd through year end. Both added that caveat that the decision would be reviewed monthly. Fed\u2019s Mester (hawk \u2013 non voter) maintained her hawkish stance as she sees the need to go a \u201clittle bit\u201d higher on rates:The labour market has come more into balance.From what I see so far, we might have to go a bit higher, we might have to raise the policy rate a bit more.There is still a lot of time before our next decision in September and we will get a lot of data and information by then.Gasoline prices are rising again. We have to be very attentive to that.The longer inflation stays above 2%, the more likely it is that the risks will materialise.If we end up raising interest rates too much and the economy loses momentum more than necessary, we can lower interest rates.We will certainly not continue to raise interest rates until inflation has already fallen to 2%. Nor will we wait to lower interest rates until inflation is at 2%.There are upside risks to our inflation forecasts, in my view.Wednesday:The Australian Q2 GDP beat expectations:GDP Q2 0.4% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% prior.BoJ\u2019s Takata sounded optimistic on hitting the inflation target but remains wary of downside risks:Japan is seeing early signs of hitting 2% inflation.Japan's economy is recovering moderately.He believes that the Bank of Japan must patiently maintain easy monetary policy given the very high uncertainty on the outlook.At the same time, BOJ must respond nimbly to uncertainty with eye on economic, price outlook.There's a chance Japan will see shift in public perception prices and wages won't rise much.Japan seeing signs of change in corporate wage, price-setting behaviour.There is sign of change in Japan's trend inflation as rising wages push up inflation expectations.Inflation is already exceeding BOJ's 2% target but there is some distance to achieving it stably and in sustainable fashion.If overseas economies slow sharply, that could weigh on Japan's economy.Stronger than expected US economy having an impact on currencies.Overseas factors having greater impact on currencies.We need to stand ready to flexibly respond to uncertainty.Action in July was a flexible response.ECB\u2019s Villeroy (neutral \u2013 voter) is leaning more towards keeping interest rates high for longer rather than raising them more:There is a slowdown but no recession.Had first successes against inflation but need to persevere.Must bring inflation down to 2% level between now and 2025.We are near or very near the peak on interest rates.Our options are open at the next and upcoming rate meetings.Maintaining rates for a sufficiently long period now counts more than further rate hikes.ECB\u2019s Knot (hawk \u2013 voter) didn\u2019t sound much confident on a September rate hike:Markets may be underestimating September rate hike chances.Bringing inflation to 2% by the end of 2025 is the bare minimum.Rate hike is a possibility, not a certainty.The Eurozone July Retail Sales missed expectations on the M/M figure but beat on the Y/Y one:Retail Sales M/M -0.2% vs. -0.1% expected and 0.2% prior (revised from -0.3%).Retail Sales Y/Y -1.0% vs. -1.2% expected and -1.0% prior (revised from -1.0%).ECB\u2019s Kazimir (hawk \u2013 voter) favours one last rate hike:The preferable option would be to hike rates by 25 bps next week.One more, likely last rate hike, still needed.The alternative option would be to hike in October or December.Inflation remains stubbornly high, price growth expectations too far above 2%.Fed\u2019s Collins (neutral \u2013 non voter) is leaning towards a high for longer stance rather than a higher for longer one:It's time for monetary policy to be patient and deliberate.Fed should 'allow time' when making monetary policy choices.Too soon to say inflation sustainably moving back to target.Fed must balance lowering inflation against slowing economy too much.Fed can likely achieve goals without causing notable economic pain.Still too much job market demand.Wage growth remains elevated.Core services inflation moderation has been modest.Expects economy to slow into end of year.BoE\u2019s Bailey (neutral \u2013 voter) is expecting a \u201cmarked\u201d fall in inflation by year-end:Wage bargaining has surprised to the upside.There has been a very large terms of trade shock in this country.Many indicators are signalling a fall in inflation, which will be marked by the end of this year.Question is: As headline inflation comes down, will we see inflation expectations continue to come down and will that impact wage bargaining?There is not group think at the MPC at the moment.BoE\u2019s Dhingra (dove \u2013 voter) maintains her dovish stance as she expects the monetary policy lags to start affecting the economy more heavily:Labour market continues to ease as MPC's hiking cycle takes effect with a lag.Pass-through of level changes to wages would not necessarily pose a risk to our target in the medium term.Not yet evidence to suggest firms will seek to increase their margins.Domestic factors are likely to continue to ease the pressure on CPI inflation.The Bank of Canada kept interest rates steady at 5.00% as expected:The Canadian economy has entered a period of weaker growth. The tightness in the labour market has continued to ease gradually. Recent CPI data indicate that inflationary pressures remain broad-based. With the recent increase in gasoline prices, CPI inflation is expected to be higher in the near term before easing again. With recent evidence that excess demand in the economy is easing, and given the lagged effects of monetary policy, Governing Council decided to hold the policy interest rate at 5%.Governing Council remains concerned about the persistence of underlying inflationary pressures, and is prepared to increase the policy interest rate further if needed. Growth prospects in China have diminished. In the United States, growth was stronger than expected.The US ISM Services PMI beat expectations by a big margin coming at 54.5 vs. 52.5 expected and 52.7 prior:employment index 54.7 vs. 50.7 prior.new orders index 57.5 vs. 55.0 prior.prices paid index 58.9 vs. 56.8 prior.new export orders 62.1 vs. 61.1 prior.imports 52.3 vs. 52.3 prior.backlog of orders 41.8 vs. 52.1 prior.inventories 57.7 vs. 50.4 prior.supplier deliveries 48.5 vs. 48.1 prior.inventory sentiment 61.5 vs. 56.6 prior.The Fed release the Beige Book which provides recent anecdotal information on current economic conditions: Most Districts indicated economic growth was modest during July and August. Consumer spending on tourism was stronger than expected but other retail spending continued to slow, especially non-essential.Some Districts highlighted reports suggesting consumers may have exhausted their savings and are relying more on borrowing to support spending. New auto sales did expand in many Districts, but contacts noted this had more to do with better availability of inventory rather than increased consumer demand. Manufacturing contacts in several Districts also noted that supply chain delays improved. New orders were stable or declined in most Districts, and backlogs shortened. Nearly all Districts reported the inventory of homes for sale remained constrained.Some Districts reported higher delinquencies on consumer credit lines.Job growth was subdued across the nation. Nearly all Districts indicated businesses renewed their previously unfulfilled expectations that wage growth will slow broadly in the near term.Most Districts reported price growth slowed overall, decelerating faster in manufacturing and consumer-goods sectors.Thursday:BoJ Nakagawa thinks that it\u2019s appropriate to maintain easy monetary policy for now but there are signs that inflation is on path to achieve their target and the risk that it could even accelerate more than expected:Appropriate to maintain easy monetary policy for time being.Signs of change seen in Japan's corporate price, wage-setting behaviour.Still not at stage where we can say Japan has stably, sustainably achieved BOJ\u2019s price targetMonetary easing involves various side-effects.BOJ will conduct flexible market operation when 10-year JGB yield moves in range of 0.5-1.0% range with eye on interest rate levels and speed of moves.BOJ\u2019s July decision has heightened sustainability of its monetary easing framework.Japan's capex, consumption increasing moderately.Japan's economy likely to continue recovering moderately.Our baseline scenario is for consumer inflation to gradually re-accelerate after a period of slowdown.There is chance inflation could accelerate more than expected, though there is also chance pass-through of costs could moderate.Job market tightening but outlook for wages also depends on corporate earnings.Price rises for goods broadening, service prices also rising mainly for accommodation fees.Must be vigilant to risk of further slowdown in global growth.Sees equal degree of upside and downside risks to inflation.Can exit NIRP when economy is strong enough.But there is no preset idea on order or timing of that.It depends on financial developments at the time.Does not want to comment on FX levels.Strong outcome in next year's wage talks would be a necessary condition, though not a sufficient one to contemplate pursuing end of negative rates.Want to look at various factors beyond wages in deciding future policy changes.Further YCC tweak cannot be ruled out but is not an imminent issue now.The Chinese trade data beat expectations but the readings remain very poor:Exports Y/Y -8.8% vs. -9.2% expected and -14.5% prior. Imports Y/Y -7.3% vs. -9.0% expected and -12.4% prior. RBA\u2019s Lowe gave his final speech as Governor as Deputy Governor Bullock will take over as the new head on September 18:My recent focus is risk wages, profits run ahead of rates consistent with return to inflation target.If this risk materialised and inflation became sticky, would require tighter monetary policy.Will be difficult to return to the earlier world in which inflation tracked in a very narrow range.Inflation is likely to be more variable around target.Australia has been well served by a flexible inflation target.Possible that Australia can sustain unemployment rates below what we have had over the past 40 years.Now in an environment of stronger growth in nominal wages, which is positive.The recent productivity record isn\u2019t encouraging; solution fundamentally a political problem.Interest rates influence housing prices but are not reason Australia has some of the highest prices in the world.Issue that defined my term more than any other was forward guidance on rates during the pandemic.Guidance was widely interpreted as a commitment, rather than a conditional statement.With the benefit of hindsight, my view is that we did do too much during pandemic.The Switzerland August seasonally adjusted Unemployment Rate remained steady at 2.1% vs. 2.1% expected and 2.1% prior. The Eurozone Q2 Final GDP reading was 0.1% vs. 0.3% expected as the previous estimate was revised to 0.1%:Household consumption flat.Government expenditure 0.1%.Gross fixed capital formation 0.1%.External balance -0.4%.Changes in inventories 0.4%.The US Jobless Claims beat expectations by a big margin across the board: Initial Claims 216K vs. 234K expected and 228K prior. Continuing Claims 1679K vs. 1715K expected and 1725K prior. The BoC Governor Macklem delivered a hawkish speech titled \"staying the course\u201d:We are concerned that progress in bringing down inflation has slowed.We are prepared to raise rates again but don't want to raise rates than we have to.The longer we wait, the harder it is likely to be to reduce inflation.Monetary policy might not be restrictive enough to restore price stability.Bank is concerned that larger-than-normal price increases for goods and services remain broad based.We are not trying to kill economic growth.The biggest contribution to the slowing in inflation since the peak last year has been from energy, which accounts for two-thirds of the slowdown.Today, about 60% of CPI components are rising above 3% and about 45% are rising above 5%.Looking ahead, we want to see less-generalized price increases as well as a decline in the average price increase.The weakness in second-quarter GDP largely reflected a broad-based slowing in consumer spending and a decline in housing activity.We will be watching wage growth closely.Maybe we don't need to do more, maybe we do on interest rates.We will take decisions meeting by meeting.Expecting growth of 'a little less than 1%' over the next few quarters.You can expect headline inflation is going to go up in the near term, before it eases.Fed\u2019s Williams (neutral \u2013 voter) just expressed the uncertainty policymakers are currently facing:Labor market balances are evening out.There's still more data to come before next FOMC meeting.Inflation is far too high but moving down.Policy is in a good place, is data dependent.We are seeing movement in the right direction for the economy.It's an open question if monetary policy is restrictive enough.The latest consumer spending data has been strong.Expects unemployment rate to rise to low 4% range.Fed\u2019s Goolsbee (dove \u2013 voter) maintains his stance as he prefers to keep rates high for longer rather than higher for longer:It's possible we can get on 'golden path'.Monetary policy is working.Overall level of inflation is above where we want it.Clearly there are risks.China, US government shutdown are among possible risks.We have also had false dawns on inflation before.Want to see progress on core inflation, especially goods and housing.Market's expectations on inflation also have a major influence.I'd pay less attention to wage growth as an indicator of inflation.We are very rapidly approaching time when are argument is not about how high should rates go, but rather how long rates have to stay high.Collectively Fed forecast is that rates will have to stay up for a relatively extended period.You can't change the inflation target until you've hit your inflation target.We have to get to the 2% inflation target, retain credibility.A possible UAW strike could have an impact, it could be material to our decisions.Fed\u2019s Logan (hawk \u2013 voter) called for a skip at the upcoming September FOMC meeting:'Could be appropriate' to skip interest-rate increase in September.There is 'work left to do' to get to sufficiently restrictive policy.Skipping does not imply stopping rate hikes.Not yet convinced we've extinguished excess inflation.Fed needs to calibrate policy 'carefully,' must proceed gradually.Significantly lower inflation in recent months 'encouraging,' but too soon to confidently say on path to 2% in timely way.Job market strength suggests we have not finished the job of restoring price stability.If stronger economic activity continues, could lead to a resurgence of inflation.Friday:Japan July Average Cash Earnings growth slowed down more, and the wages data is something the BoJ is particularly focused on:Average Cash Earnings Y/Y 1.3% vs. 2.3% prior. Real Wages Y/Y -2.5%.Household spending -5.00% vs. -4.2% prior.The Japanese Final Q2 GDP missed expectations and the previous reading was revised downwards:Japan Q2 GDP 1.2% vs. 1.3% expected and 0.8% prior (revised from 1.5%).GDP Growth Annualised 4.8% vs. 5.5% expected and 3.2% prior (revised from 6%).The Canadian Jobs report showed another pick up in wage growth which is something the BoC is particularly focused on:Employment change 39.9K vs. 20.0K expected and -6.4K prior.Full time 32.2K vs. 1.7K prior.Part time 7.8K vs. -8.1K prior.Participation rate 65.5% vs. 65.6% expected and 65.6% prior.Average hourly wages permanent employees 5.2% vs. 4.7% expected and 5.0% prior.Unemployment rate 5.5% vs. 5.6% expected and 5.5% prior.The highlights for next week will be:Tuesday: UK Labour Market report, German ZEW, US NFIB Small Business Optimism Index.Wednesday: Japan PPI, UK GDP, EZ Industrial Production, US CPI.Thursday: Australia Labour Market report, Japan Industrial Production, Switzerland PPI, ECB Policy Decision, US Jobless Claims, US PPI, US Retail Sales.Friday: NZ Manufacturing PMI, China Industrial Production and Retail Sales, Eurozone Wages data, US University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment.

        "description": "Week Ahead 11th-15th SeptemberMON: Norwegian CPI (Aug)TUE: EIA STEO, OPEC MOMR; Swedish Unemployment (Aug), UK Unemployment (Aug) & Wages (Jul), NorwegianGDP (Jul), Germany/EZ ZEW (Sep)WED: IEA OMR; UK GDP Estimate (Jul), US CPI (Aug)THU: ECB Policy Announcement, Norges Bank Regional Network; Australian Employment (Aug), Swedish CPIF (Aug),US Retail Sales (Aug), IJC (w/e 4th Sep), New Zealand Manufacturing PMI (Aug)FRI: Quad Witching, CBR Policy Announcement, ECB TLTRO Repayment Publication; Chinese Industrial Output/Production, Retail Sales, House Prices (Aug), EZ Trade Balance (Jul), US Export/Import Prices (Aug), IndustrialProduction (Aug), NY Fed Manufacturing (Sep), Uni. of Michigan Prelim. (Sep)NOTE: Previews are listed in day orderNORWEGIAN CPI (MON): The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced.UK UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES (TUE): Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end.UK GDP ESTIMATE (WED): A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought.US CPI (WED): Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern.ECB ANNOUNCEMENT (THU): 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%.AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYMENT (THU): participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms.SWEDISH CPIF (THU): July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak.US RETAIL SALES (THU): Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July. While the data set will offer a glimpse on the health of the consumer amid concerns that the economy may slow significantly in the months ahead, traders will also be watching the University of Michigan's prelim survey release due Friday, where the rise in energy prices is likely to have weighed on sentiment.CHINESE ACTIVITY DATA (FRI): Retail sales Y/Y in August are expected to rise by 2.8% (prev. 2.5%), whilst there is currently no consensus for Industrial Production metrics. The data will be closely watched to diagnose the health of the world\u2019s second-larger economy and to gauge the drip-feed of stimulus seen over recent weeks. Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d.This article originally appeared on Newsquawk This article was written by Newsquawk Analysis at www.forexlive.com.",

        "content": "Two megatrends have shaped American life since the 1980s: The rise of China and the hollowing out of U.S. industry. China\u2019s economic boom prompted a thousand predictions \u2014 that it will soon surpass us as an economic power; that the 21st century is going to be a Chinese century; that America is an aging, decadent nation destined for second place. The hollowing out of U.S. industry fed the sense that capitalism is betraying the middle class. America has a parasitic financial sector, but we don\u2019t make things anymore. Manufacturing jobs got outsourced to China and Mexico, and wages stagnated. These two trends contributed to the sense that America is in decline \u2014 to the angry, gloomy pall that has settled over political life. But it\u2019s beginning to look as if those two megatrends are reversing. China does not look like a growing dynamic power, but a troubled, stagnating one. Growth rates are falling. The unemployment rate for those ages 16 to 24 in urban areas is at a demoralizing 21%. Private investment is sluggish. A forecast from Bloomberg Economics now projects that the size of the Chinese economy will not successfully surpass the size of the U.S. economy \u2014 despite its vastly greater population. The causes of China\u2019s stagnation are myriad and deep: an overinvestment in real estate, the decline in foreign investment as the state becomes more menacing, the decline of exports, the demographic doom spiral. Since 2016, the actual number of births in China has fallen by nearly 50%. But the core problems are endemic to the regime: Centralized authoritarian control is incompatible with a wide-open, innovative, free-flowing modern economy. Industrial policy may look good for a short time, but it ossifies. China now has a plethora of zombie corporations, which suck up subsidies without successfully competing in the marketplace. Open information flow is crucial to any nation; when the state suppresses information unflattering to the regime, then everything is bound to sink into mediocrity. As the Chinese economy deflates, U.S. industry is looking less hollow. America has a net gain of 530,000 manufacturing jobs since January 2017. The manufacturing boom has been torrid of late. Since late 2021, investment in the construction of manufacturing facilities has more than doubled. Much of that boom is happening in the Mountain West, the Upper Midwest and parts of the Southeast. Chips, electric vehicles, renewable energy sources and batteries are being manufactured in places like Michigan, Kentucky, Minnesota and Arizona. What lessons are we to draw from these two ongoing turnarounds? The first is that there\u2019s a lot of resilience and dynamism in America\u2019s brand of broadly free market capitalism. As I\u2019ve noted before, in 1990, the European and U.S. gross domestic products per capita were nearly neck and neck. Since then, America has surged ahead. U.S. labor productivity increased by 67% between 1990 and 2022, compared to 55% in Europe and 51% in Japan. In 2012, I heard a commencement speech by Dr. Atul Gawande that introduced me to the phrase \u201cfailure to rescue.\u201d He reported on a study that found the best hospitals don\u2019t necessarily prevent bad things from happening, but they\u2019re really good at rescuing people when they have a complication to prevent failures from becoming catastrophes. The U.S. economy, especially in the Midwest, is kind of like that. Many of those places have experienced economic decline, but governments and people have shifted and adapted, and they are bouncing back. The second lesson I draw is that Bidenomics is working \u2014 big time. President Joe Biden promised to help America outcompete authoritarian China and to heal some of the economic divides at home. Both those goals are being achieved. According to the Treasury Department, more than 80% of the investment made through the Inflation Reduction Act is going to counties with college graduation rates lower than the national average. Nearly 90% of investments are being made in counties with below-average weekly wages. I know many of you think Biden is too old, but I\u2019d vote for a 100-year-old who could keep delivering results like that. The third lesson I draw is that the right-wing populists are hopelessly outdated. Take, for example, writer Sohrab Ahmari, who argues that \u201cthe state must also take a far more active role in coordinating economic activity for the good of the whole community.\u201d But China\u2019s industrial policy illustrates the classic downsides of excessive state interference. Even the vaunted German model, one of the great success stories of the 20th century, is showing its age. German manufacturing output and gross domestic product have been stagnant since 2018. U.S. politics is dysfunctional, our social fabric is in tatters, but somehow our economy is among the strongest in the world. Our economic competitors stumble and fall; we stumble and somehow bounce back.",

        "content": "Two megatrends have shaped American life since the 1980s: The rise of China and the hollowing out of U.S. industry. China\u2019s economic boom prompted a thousand predictions \u2014 that it will soon surpass us as an economic power; that the 21st century is going to be a Chinese century; that America is an aging, decadent nation destined for second place. The hollowing out of U.S. industry fed the sense that capitalism is betraying the middle class. America has a parasitic financial sector, but we don\u2019t make things anymore. Manufacturing jobs got outsourced to China and Mexico, and wages stagnated. These two trends contributed to the sense that America is in decline \u2014 to the angry, gloomy pall that has settled over political life. But it\u2019s beginning to look as if those two megatrends are reversing. China does not look like a growing dynamic power, but a troubled, stagnating one. Growth rates are falling. The unemployment rate for those ages 16 to 24 in urban areas is at a demoralizing 21%. Private investment is sluggish. A forecast from Bloomberg Economics now projects that the size of the Chinese economy will not successfully surpass the size of the U.S. economy \u2014 despite its vastly greater population.

        "content": "Forbes Leadership Leadership Strategy Next Recession Not Likely A Disaster Bill Conerly Senior Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. I connect the dots between the economy ... and business! Following Sep 9, 2023, 07:30am EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Job seekers in 2008-09 recession. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) Getty Images The next recession will not be a disaster. I expect a recession to begin early in 2024, or possibly late this year, and that frightens many people. But recessions do not hurt most people, though they certainly can be very harmful to some. Employment in Recessions Unemployment rises during recessions, but not as much as we seem to fear. In the recessions between 1948 and 2019, the unemployment rate during the downturns was 1.4 percentage point higher than in the 12 months preceding the recession. The average time spent unemployed increased by less than one week during recessions. Working hours are cut in recessions, but by only 24 minutes a week on average. (The Data Note at the end of this article explains the methodology behind the numbers in this article.) Definition of Recession In assessing the data, we must remember that economists define a recession as the period when economic activity is declining. Once the decline is over and the economy turns up a little, we say the recession is over even though we have not yet recovered all of the lost ground. For some variables, the data often look their worst just after the recession has technically ended. Home Prices in Recession The median and average selling prices of homes usually rise in recession. That\u2019s surprising given what happened in 2008-09, when prices fell six percent by our comparison of the recession average to the 12 prior months. From the peak for prices (which occurred a year before the recession began), to the trough (two years after the recession ended), the decline was a whopping 19%. Recessions are not good for home prices. But prices usually rise over the long haul. Recessions typically slow the rise without turning prices downward. Of the ten recessions for which we have data (not counting 2020), only one shows a clear decline in prices. Eight recessions had home price increases, with the 1990 recession ambiguous.

Keep in mind that delinquent means at least 30 days late. Most delinquencies do not result in foreclosure. Banks write off more consumer loans in recession, but by less than one percentage point. Commercial real estate is even safer, with charge-offs increasing by only 0.6 percentage points. Business non-real estate lending charge-offs rise by a similar amount. Most Recession Effects Temporary In the typical economic model, the effects of a recession are temporary because the economy bounces back with above-normal growth rates, regaining its trend line. There have been some studies finding long-lasting impacts on those people who tried to find their first jobs during a recession and on people who were laid off in a recession. These studies are suggestive rather than definitive given data limitations. The most cited study found the impacts lasted seven to ten years but were not permanent. 2008-09 Recession Was Unusually Bad Today\u2019s fear of recession probably derives from the 2008-09 experience, which was especially harsh. In terms of overall impact on gross domestic product, that recession was twice as bad as the average recession preceding it. GDP declines in recessions. Dr. Bill Conerly based on data from U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis The chart shows substantial variation from one recession to another. For other variables, such as the average duration of unemployment, the range is comparably large. The largest recession increase was 2.2 weeks; the smallest 0.2 weeks. That illustrates that each recession is unique. The underly economy evolves over time, making the likely effects of a recession in the 2020s different from the 1950s. In addition, each recession occurs with unique external influences, such as world oil prices. Policy responses to recession also vary from case to case. As a result, we should not expect any particular downturn to mirror a past recession. But the past does give us an idea of the likely range of possibilities. Data Note: Recessions are defined by the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private non-profit organization. I do not include the 2020 recession in these calculations because it was atypical, being just two months in duration but very severe in magnitude. Some of the data series are not available back to 1948, so their averages were calculated over shorter time periods. Comparison of recessions with the 12 months preceding the recession is done because of drift over time in unemployment and other variables. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn . Check out my website .

[+] word-of-mouth concept vector illustration getty If there\u2019s one thing that stands out about the market for our favorite high-yield investments in 2023, it\u2019s this: individual investors are still too skittish to jump in. That\u2019s our chance, because this \u201clag\u201d means CEFs\u2019 prices haven\u2019t taken off, and these funds are throwing off dividend yields in the same neighborhood they were at the start of 2022\u2014around 7.5%, on average, today. And by being just a little picky (as we will be with the fund talk about a bit further on), we can amp those payouts up to 10%+. Combine that with the discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of CEFs\u2019 portfolios) available across the space, and we\u2019ve got a shot at real upside, especially when you consider how far behind the S&P 500 that CEFs have lagged this year. Equity Sub-Index Returns 2023 CEF Insider When we look at the CEF Insider Equity Sub-Index (a good proxy for stock-holding CEFs), we see that total returns for these funds are just 2% for 2023, a fraction of the S&P 500\u2019s 18% or so as of this writing. Clearly, individual CEF investors are still sitting on the sidelines, nearly a year into the stock-market recovery.

That\u2019s understandable, but it\u2019s off the mark. A lot of headlines about 2023\u2019s strong year for stocks overlook the fact that the S&P 500 is still off all-time highs by about 6% or so. In any event, individual investors\u2019 skittishness is visible in the numbers, with mutual-fund inflows having just recently turned positive after several months of outflows last year and through the first half of 2023. It\u2019s surprising, and really kind of silly, that investors have taken money out of stocks and stock funds in a year when the S&P 500 is up over 18%! It begs the question of how stocks are rising if individual investors aren\u2019t buying them. The answer is that hedge funds, investment banks and other large players have been getting there first because they know the fear of 2022 has caused a lag on investor money coming into the market. And with CEFs, that inflow has lagged even longer, giving us our in. But it\u2019s key to remember that this inflow is delayed, not terminated, making now a smart time to buy and lock in not only CEFs\u2019 unusual discounts but their high yields, too. So, what data is driving those big rich companies to front run everyday investors? Lower inflation, for one, which has reduced pressure on the Fed to further hike interest rates. A topping out and rolling over of rates would, of course, be good for stocks and CEFs. At the same time, the US added more jobs than expected in August, and the unemployment rate rose because more people are returning to the labor force\u2014a positive sign for productivity, spending and, in turn, stocks and stock-focused CEFs. Lower inflation also frees up more money for consumers to choose what they spend on, which tends to encourage them to spend more. These days, for example, Americans are spending about as much on gas as they did before the pandemic, during the economically strong years of 2015 to 2019, and less than they spent in the early 2010s, before oil prices collapsed in 2014. A CEF like the Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG) is a good way to play this lagged demand for equity CEFs. To start, it offers a 10.9% dividend that\u2019s found extra support from the fund\u2019s NAV performance, which has gained 20% this year, nearly double the fund\u2019s current yield. The fund, as the name suggests, is tech-focused, and fast-growing companies like Palo Alto Networks PANW (PANW), NVIDIA NVDA DIA (NVDA) and Lattice Semiconductor LSCC (LSCC) are top holdings\u2014and all are benefiting from the rapid growth of AI. That tech portfolio might have you concerned that NBXG is overvalued, but, thanks to foot-dragging individual investors, we\u2019ve got a chance to buy cheap\u201416.1% off cheap, to be exact: that\u2019s the discount to NAV at which the fund trades now. In other words, NBXG is one of the few places where you can buy NVIDIA shares for less than they trade for, and you get a 10.9% dividend, too. This is the kind of fund that investors can ignore for only so long\u2014and when they come back aboard, that premium is likely to narrow, taking NBXG\u2019s price with it.

        "content": "For weekend reading, Gary Alexander, senior writer at Navellier & Associates, offers the following commentary: The August was released at 5:30 am (my time) on Friday, September 1. Do we really expect all the bean counters at the U.S. Labor Department to calculate ALL the job changes in the month of August at the crack of dawn on the first day of September? Do companies really report, in a timely manner at the close of business on August 31, about everybody they hired and fired that day, that week? As a case in point, the original June U.S. Labor Department report on new jobs was 209,000, but the August revision to the June count was ratcheted lower by 50% \u2013 to 105,000 \u2013 making June the smallest monthly gain since December 2020. What happened to those 104,000 jobs that never existed? If a key data metric can be off by 50% two months later, why report it at all? Why not wait until it is accurate? What\u2019s even more amazing, ADP reported last Wednesday (August 30) that 177,000 private payroll jobs were created in August \u2013 while there were still two days left in August! The media noted that the 177,000 total was \u201cslower than normal.\u201d Well, of course! The month was not yet over. What\u2019s the hurry, everyone? Upon release of Friday\u2019s downbeat jobs report, President Biden repeated what the Washington Post called a \u201cbottomless Pinocchio,\u201d that \u201cwe\u2019ve added 13.5 million new jobs since I took office\u2026. We created more jobs in two years than any president ever created in four years.\u201d But less than a minute later, he told the truth: \u201cWe\u2019ve recovered all the jobs lost during the . We\u2019ve added a million more new jobs!\u201d Amazingly, few press \u201cfact checkers\u201d highlighted the 12.5 \u201cjobs created\u201d gap in the President\u2019s speech. And not to get too on you, but all this brouhaha over jobs begs the question of what a job is. In these widely watched monthly reports, a \u201cjob\u201d can be part-time work, or a temporary fill-in position, or a million-dollar CEO placement. Some jobs are more \u201csticky\u201d and higher quality than other semi-jobs. We could resolve these confusing and conflicting numbers by: (1) waiting until the numbers are accurate; (2) measuring only full-time jobs, with part-time jobs measured in fractions; and (3) ignoring algorithms for seasonal adjustments. To be \u201cseasonal,\u201d just compare any given month to the same month a year ago. The recent drop in job openings probably reflects slower economic growth and the fact that more former workers are returning to the labor force, perhaps due to their savings running dry. However, as the next chart shows, there are still about 1.5 job openings per unemployed worker. (In 2019, the ratio was 1.2) Ayn Rand wrote a novel in 1957 about executives, inventors and entrepreneurs quietly dropping out due to too much state intervention in their businesses and lives, but something like the opposite is happening now, with executives begging for workers, while the mass of post-Covid America is quietly shrugging when offered jobs. We\u2019ve all seen the \u201chelp wanted\u201d signs, and the evidence of closed businesses, slow service, understaffed shops, banks, and restaurants, nationwide. Locally, it\u2019s hard to find workers and now our local county government has chosen Labor Day 2023 to announce adoption of a 32-hour work week. The County will continue to provide the same services it does today. The County is taking the bold step of holding wages relatively constant but reducing the work week by eight hours. This effectively gives the employee a sizeable increase in hourly wages. The press release promises \u201cthe same services\u201d by \u201creducing the work week\u201d without adding new staff. That, of course, is only possible if the staff were previously goofing off for at least eight hours per week. This has been part of what has been called \u201cThe Great Resignation,\u201d of Americans choosing to stay at home, for a variety of reasons. According to SHRM (August 16, 2023), \u201cThe Great Resignation\u2019s impact on states is continuing to develop, as ongoing elevated quit-levels have led to increased job openings.\u201d Earlier, I asked, \u201cWhat is a Job?\u201d since my 11-year-old grandson asked me over the Labor Day weekend why fathers move their families away from home, from city to city, \u201cjust to change jobs.\u201d I used that opportunity to explain the difference between jobs and careers. A job is something to put food on the table and pay the rent, but a career is a passion you follow. Even though my father, like so many in his era, worked for one big firm for 35 years, Boeing\u2019s mission in 1962, moved from defense and airliners to fulfill JFK\u2019s mandate to put a man on the moon, so dad made a jarring move from Seattle to Alabama. Early jobs aren\u2019t necessarily careers, but they serve as necessary stepping-stones to learn basic skills. In the 1970s, two books helped me plot a career when I felt trapped in dead-end jobs: \u201cWhat Color Is Your Parachute?\u201d by Richard Bolles was the most helpful. Bolles asks only three questions: What do you want to do? Where do you want to do it? and: With whom do you want to do it? The answers flowed freely (to me) from the guidance in that book. Then, to convince company owners I was their man, Carl R. Boll\u2019s \u201cExecutive Jobs Unlimited\u201d convinced me that resumes were fodder for wastebaskets, but targeted letters were catnip. Once you meet one influential employer, the rest is reputation and references among peers. The word \u201cjobs\u201d reminds me of tasks I don\u2019t want to do, like weeding or taking out the trash. Economists treat the word \u201cjobs\u201d like \u201ccredit cards\u201d or \u201cTVs\u201d or \u201cphones,\u201d something everyone is supposed to have, but something that is only measured as a means to their end of \u201cfull employment.\u201d It\u2019s no wonder people want to quit or reduce their hours to 32, so they can binge-watch a new series on their 72-inch HDTV. But a career is doing what you want to do each day. In that case, you never have to \u201cwork\u201d a day in your life. I hope my five grandsons find what I found (indeed created\u2026or was gifted) \u2013 a career, not just a job.",

        "content": "In 2021, federal policy action helped to cut child poverty in half and achieve the lowest child poverty rate in the . In a matter of weeks, however, the Census Bureau is poised to reveal that child poverty rates from 2021 to 2022, likely climbing back to their pre-COVID levels. What lessons should policymakers have learned from COVID-19 for maintaining low child poverty rates moving forward? This is the core question I ask in \u201c ,\u201d and I emphasize three of the many lessons here. First, if Congress wishes to get back to its record-low child poverty rate, it should return to the policy that made it possible: the expanded Child Tax Credit that, in 2021, provided cash payments to nearly all families with children regardless of parents\u2019 employment status. The consequences of the temporary CTC expansion were vast: it immediately cut monthly child poverty rates by around , contributed to the record-low child poverty rate in 2021, temporarily brought the U.S. child poverty rate in line with , had the American welfare state cutting child poverty , cut food hardship among families with children by , had no meaningful short-run consequences for , and increased low-income families\u2019 at child care centers and grocery stores. The pandemic not only provided evidence on which policies work to reduce children\u2019s exposure to poverty, but also the urgency of doing so: at the start of 2020, the average Black adult who was in poverty had also spent 57 percent of her childhood in poverty, compared to 20 percent for the average White adult in poverty. These disparate experiences of poverty, accumulating from birth onward, contributed directly to racial/ethnic disparities in health and employment outcomes at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cumulative exposure to poverty from childhood onward helps to explain why adults in the highest poverty counties in the U.S. had a COVID-related death rate nearly twice that of adults in the lowest-poverty counties, equivalent to the gaps in death rates between Germany and Romania in the EU. Poverty, after all, is not merely a point-in-time state, but an economic condition that, once experienced, often lingers throughout one\u2019s life, inflicting costs that range from poorer health conditions to reduced long-run economic opportunity. The 2021 CTC expansion worked in reducing those costs, but its discontinuation ensures that child poverty is poised to rise again. Second, if cross-party compromise is necessary to achieve an expanded, 2021-like CTC, then Democrats should be ready to to trade-in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.\u201cWelfare,\u201d as the program is commonly known, provided very little direct support for families during the pandemic: cash support from ; the expanded CTC, in contrast, cut child poverty rates by 44 percent the next year \u2014 15 times the magnitude of TANF. Meanwhile, state governments target toward Black families relative to White families, exacerbating racial differences in poverty targets. And TANF itself is shrinking each year: the program\u2019s annual funding level is not updated for inflation, ensuring that its overall cost, and also its trade-in value, decreases by the year. There are costs to abandoning TANF, but should the political balance of Congress require that it need to identify cost offsets in order to fund an expanded CTC at 2021 benefit levels, TANF should not be excluded from consideration. A third lesson: Congress should Invest more resources into the Census Bureau\u2019s data-collection capabilities to better track, in close to real-time, the well-being of households across the country. The pandemic revealed that our public data infrastructure is not prepared to inform month-to-month trends in poverty and hardship. As a result, researchers like me have had to get creative to track poverty on a , to measure exposure to across the country, and more. But knowledge of how low-income households are faring on a month-to-month basis should not be a result of researchers\u2019 data innovations; instead, adding four questions \u2013 one each on total resources received during the prior month, food insufficiency, mental health, and housing hardship \u2013 to the Census Bureau\u2019s and Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 monthly household surveys would offer representative and real-time measures of the well-being of the nation moving forward. The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us the importance of having timely and comprehensive data on poverty and well-being to guide policymaking decisions; these small changes would allow for that beyond the pandemic. There are several other key policy lessons that emerge from COVID-19 and that \u201c \u201d elaborates on. To name a few: we should learn from the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and expand access to Unemployment Insurance (UI) among jobless adults, even before prioritizing UI benefit increases. We should build the administrative capacity to convert the Paycheck Protection Program into a targeted work-sharing program. And we should convert some lump-sum, refundable tax credits to monthly payments to better help households with their everyday needs. The COVID-19 pandemic offered many lessons for improving economic well-being in the U.S. beyond the pandemic. We witnessed the menacing consequences of poverty, but also the enormous power and capability of the state to reduce poverty and improve well-being among households going through difficult times. To not apply these lessons moving forward would be a detriment to all those who happen to experience life in low-income America.",

        "content": "If you recently lost your job and are worried about paying your student loans, you have several options to set your bill to $0. Though the national unemployment rate was just 3.8% in August, up slightly from July, layoffs continue to hit workers in industries like tech, media, entertainment, fashion and consulting. Nearly 1,000 tech companies have collectively laid off some 230,000 workers so far in 2023, according to tech industry layoff tracker Layoffs.fyi. To make matters even more stressful, federal student loan payments are set to resume in October, after more than three years of an interest-free payment pause that began in March 2020. \u201cDon't feel bad if you have to make tough choices and reprioritize,\u201d says Scott Stark, a senior financial planner at Financial Finesse, a workplace financial wellness company. Here\u2019s how you can make your student loans fit into your budget as you get back on your feet. Check your budget and spending to see where you can cut back. \u201cIt's crucial to get an accurate sense of your essential expenses and rank them in order of priority,\u201d says Akeiva Ellis, a certified financial planner and CFP Board ambassador. \u201cTake the time to negotiate where it's possible, and consider areas where you can trim your budget.\u201d Student loans often have options for pausing payments that debts like credit cards or auto loans do not. \u201cIt's just about staying afloat until you get that next job,\u201d says John McCafferty, director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines, a financial advisory firm. After a layoff, reach out to your student loan servicer or lender to learn about what assistance may be available to you, says McCafferty. Your can walk you through relief options and their implications, help you update your payment amounts if you\u2019re on an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan and answer other questions you may have. Here are some specific relief options that could be available to you. An is the best option for most borrowers who lose their jobs because monthly bills are capped at a certain percentage of your . If your income disappears, your payments should drop to $0 per month. You can sign up for an IDR plan at any time, including after a layoff. Even if you\u2019re already on an IDR plan, you\u2019ll need to submit a new IDR application to update your income post-layoff. The application will ask why you\u2019re submitting it; write that you are submitting early because you want your servicer to recalculate your payment immediately. You only need to once a year. If you qualify for $0 payments, that\u2019ll last until your next recertification deadline, even if you get a new job sooner. This can give you some extra breathing room as you catch up on other bills. A is a good option to explore. The income threshold to qualify for $0 payments is more generous under SAVE than other IDR plans at about $32,800 for a household of one. And unlike other IDR plans or some unemployment deferments, unpaid interest will not build if you\u2019re on the SAVE plan, which could save you a lot of money in the long run. From Oct. 1, 2023, to Sept. 30, 2024, borrowers who don\u2019t make payments won\u2019t be penalized under a including no defaults, decreased credit scores or garnished paychecks. However, this is not an extension of the payment pause. But if you lose your job during the on-ramp, you can skip payments if needed without signing up for a deferment or forbearance. The on-ramp is automatic, so it will kick in even if you simply don\u2019t pay your student loan bill. The on-ramp isn\u2019t for everyone, Stark says. Interest will still accrue, increasing the amount you may eventually pay back, and payments are still due. Pay your bills if you can, either under an IDR plan or another repayment plan. Once the on-ramp expires in late 2024, borrowers who lose their source of income may need to consider other options. Borrowers can pause payments for up to three years with a . This route could be helpful for borrowers who are receiving unemployment benefits or actively job-hunting, says Ellis. However, depending on the type of federal loan you have, a deferment could increase the amount of interest you\u2019ll eventually pay. If you have subsidized or Perkins loans and don\u2019t want to sign up for SAVE, an unemployment deferment might be a better option than the on-ramp because subsidized loans don\u2019t accrue interest during a deferment. However, if you have unsubsidized or parent or grad PLUS loans and don\u2019t want to sign up for SAVE, the on-ramp may be better. Interest will build on these types of loans during deferment, and if you don't pay the interest as it accrues, it will be capitalized after your deferment period ends, which means it will be added to your loan principal. This could increase the total amount you'll repay over the life of your loan since you\u2019ll be paying interest on a larger principal sum. But with the on-ramp, interest won\u2019t capitalize. Private student loans offer fewer protections for unemployed borrowers than their federal counterparts. Your options will depend on your loan terms and lender. For example, private student loan lenders Ascent and FundingU offer hardship forbearances, limited to 24 months over the life of your loan. Interest will accrue during your forbearance and capitalize after the period ends, and your repayment term will be extended. To see what help is available after a layoff, like a temporary deferment or forbearance, contact your private student loan lender directly. \u201cAlways remember, whether federal or private, that communication with your loan servicers is key,\u201d says Ellis. \u201cThey're there to help you navigate these challenging times.\u201d The article How to Manage Your Student Loans After a Layoff originally appeared on NerdWallet.",

        "content": "NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 G20 leaders paid their respects at a memorial site dedicated to Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi on Sunday, a day after the forum added a new member and reached agreements on a range of issues but softened their language on Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. India, this year\u2019s host of the Group of 20 leading rich and developing nations, ended the first day of the summit with what were seen as diplomatic wins despite pointed disagreements among powerful members, particularly over the war in Ukraine. As the first session began, India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the group was adding the African Union as a member \u2014 part of the Indian leader\u2019s drive to uplift the Global South. A few hours later, India announced that it was able to get the disparate group to sign off on a final statement, but only after softening language on the contentious issue of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. It also unveiled an ambitious plan with the United States, the European Union and others to build a rail and shipping corridor linking India with the Middle East and Europe to strengthen economic growth and political cooperation. With those major agenda items taken care of, Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau, Australia\u2019s Anthony Albanese and Japan\u2019s Fumio Kishida, among others, shook hands Sunday and posed for photos with Modi as they arrived at the Rajghat memorial site in New Delhi. Modi gifted the leaders shawls made of khadi, a handspun fabric that was promoted by Gandhi during India\u2019s independence movement against the British. Some leaders \u2014 including British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and last year\u2019s G20 host President Joko Widodo of Indonesia \u2014 walked to the memorial barefoot in a customary show of respect. Many others, including U.S. President Joe Biden, wore slippers that are routinely offered to visitors as they walked over wet ground spotted with puddles from heavy rain. The leaders stood before wreaths placed around the memorial, which features an eternal flame and was draped with orange and yellow flowers marigold garlands. Notably, the one reserved for Modi identified him as president of \u201cBharat,\u201d an ancient Sanskrit name championed by his Hindu nationalist supporters that has shot to prominence as the summit approached. In the months leading up to the leaders\u2019 summit in New Delhi, India had been unable to find agreement on the wording about Ukraine, with Russia and China objecting even to language that they had agreed to at the 2022 G20 summit in Bali. This year\u2019s final statement, released a day before the formal close of the summit, highlighted the \u201chuman suffering and negative added impacts of the war in Ukraine,\u201d but did not mention Russia\u2019s invasion directly. It cited a United Nations charter, saying \u201call states must refrain from the threat or use of force to seek territorial acquisition against the territorial integrity and sovereignty or political independence of any state. The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible.\u201d By contrast, the Bali declaration cited a U.N. resolution condemning \u201cthe aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine,\u201d and said \u201cmost members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine.\u201d Western leaders \u2014 who have pushed for a stronger rebuke of Russia\u2019s actions in past G20 meetings \u2014 still called the consensus a success, and praised India\u2019s nimble balancing act. If the G20 hadn\u2019t produced a final communique, it would have been the first time and a blow to the group\u2019s prestige. Nazia Hussain, an associate research fellow at Singapore\u2019s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said the statement showed a \u201csoftening of the language on the war in Ukraine.\u201d \u201cHowever, for New Delhi, getting out a joint statement with some reference to Ukraine, or a joint statement at all especially with both the United States and its Western allies as well as China and Russia toughening their stance on the war, is a win.\u201d India had made directing more attention to addressing the needs of the developing world a focus of the summit, and organizers worked hard to keep the summit from being dominated by the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed last year\u2019s G20 summit in Bali by video and stole the show with an in-person appearance at the gathering of leaders of the G7 rich democracies\u2014 all of whom are members of the G20 \u2014 in Hiroshima earlier this year. Modi made a point of not inviting Zelenskyy to participate in this year\u2019s event, though it is impossible to decouple many issues, such as food and energy security, from the war in Ukraine. Scholz told reporters it was significant that Russia had signed on to the agreement that mentioned the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Russian negotiator Svetlana Lukash described the discussions on the Ukraine-related part of the final statement as \u201cvery difficult,\u201d adding that the agreed text had a \u201cbalanced view\u201d of the situation, Russian media reported. The G20 includes Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the U.S and the EU. Spain holds a permanent guest seat. \u2014 Associated Press writer David Rising contributed to this report.",

The 6.8-magnitude earthquake that hit late Friday killed more than 1,300 people and injured more than 1,800 more, many of them critically, according to Moroccan authorities. Support has poured in from leaders across the world. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, of Morocco's cross-strait neighbour Spain, expressed his \"solidarity and support to the people of Morocco in the wake of this terrible earthquake... Spain is with the victims of this tragedy\". German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said \"our thoughts are with the victims of this devastating earthquake. Our sympathy goes out to all those affected\". French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \"devastated\" and said that \"France stands ready to help with first aid\". The pope expressed his \"profound solidarity\" with Morocco after the quake, according to the Vatican. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni underlined \"Italy's willingness to support Morocco in this emergency\". European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed sympathy \"with the Moroccan people in the face of the terrible earthquake\". And the European Union member countries, through the European Council said in a statement: \"We are deeply saddened by the devastating consequences of this tragic event... \"As close friends and partners of Morocco, we are ready to assist in any way You may deem useful,\" said the statement, addressed to King Mohammed. The leaders of both Russia and Ukraine also offered their sympathies. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed his \"deepest condolences to HM King Mohammed VI and all Moroccans for the lives lost in the horrible earthquake\". \"Ukraine stands in solidarity with Morocco during this tragic time,\" he said on social media. Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed similar sentiments and said, in a message to Morocco's king, \"we share the pain and the mourning of the friendly Moroccan people\". Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is hosting the G20 summit this weekend, said he was \"extremely pained by the loss of lives due to an earthquake in Morocco\". Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered support to \"our Moroccan brothers in every way in this difficult hour\". Algeria, which broke off diplomatic relations with Morocco in August 2021 at the height of the crisis between the two countries, offered \"its sincere condolences to the brotherly Moroccan people for the victims of the earthquake\", said its foreign ministry. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"instructed all government bodies and forces to provide any necessary assistance to the people of Morocco, including the preparations for sending an aid delegation to the area\", his office said. It is the latest show of support in the wake of the 2020 Abraham Accords that saw Israel normalise ties with a number of Arab countries, including Morocco. The president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, said we \"stand with the Kingdom of Morocco during this difficult time and wish a speedy recovery ahead to all those affected\". He also ordered an \"air bridge to deliver critical relief\" to the country, state news agency WAM reported. Iran expressed its condolences for the \"terrible earthquake\". Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said he was \"ready to provide any form of assistance to deal with the repercussions of the devastating earthquake\". King of Jordan Abdullah II urged his government to provide all possible assistance to Morocco. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu extended his heartfelt condolences to King Mohammed VI of Morocco: \"In the face of this adversity, Nigeria will continue to stand in solidarity with Morocco as they recover, rebuild and come out stronger than ever from this unfortunate event.\" The head of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, expressed his \"sincere condolences\" to the king, the Moroccan people and the families of the victims. The secretary-general of the Jeddah-based Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Hissein Brahim Taha, prayed for \"mercy on the victims and a speedy recovery for the injured\". World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described the quake as \"heartbreaking\", adding: \"We stand ready to support the immediate health needs.\" UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said he was \"deeply saddened by news of the quake, saying \"our thoughts are with the thousands of families affected. We stand ready to support.\" The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said the response to the devastating quake could take years. UNESCO, the UN heritage organisation, said it would help Morocco draw up an inventory of damage to national heritage sites and a repair strategy. \u00a9 Copyright AFP 2023. All rights reserved.

        "content": "A rescue operation has been launched to save American caver Mark Dickey, who is stranded hundreds of meters underground in southern Turkey. The operation began at 3.28 p.m. local time (8.28 a.m. ET) on Saturday, according to Turkey's Caving Federation - a week after Dickey first became ill during an exploration mission. \"Mark's transport in a stretcher has started at 15:28 local time (GMT+3),\" Turkey's Caving Federation wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Bulent Genc, head of the caving federation, told CNN Thursday that the rescue could take days due to the fact that the cave is deep and narrow, but some experts say it could take up to two weeks. Dickey fell ill at the weekend with suspected gastrointestinal bleeding during a mission of the 1,276 meters-deep (4,186 feet) Morca Sinkhole in Morca Valley, near Anamur, southern Turkey, according to the Turkish Caving Federation. The European Cave Rescue Association (ECRA) received a call on September 2 saying that Dickey was suffering from severe gastric pain, and the next day it was reported that help from outside was needed because of his \"rising destabilization.\" His condition has since stabilized, according to the Turkish Caving Federation. Nearly 200 rescuers are on site working to get Dickey out, said Recep Salci of Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD), including dozens of people who are working inside the cave. \"Some parts of the cave are very narrow, so this will be a tough operation,\" Salci said, adding that a stretcher will be used to assist Dickey out of the cave. Doctors had been working on improving Dickey's health so that the \"difficult\" ascent to the surface can begin \"without further complications,\" the ECRA said Friday, noting that \"rescue teams are preparing the way out to the entrance by installing additional ropes and fixings.\" The operation plans to divide the cave into seven parts and assign responsibility to the rescue teams of different countries at various depths, the ECRA said. Turkish, Hungarian, Polish, Italian, Croatian and Bulgarian teams are all involved in the rescue. Dickey became ill and was placed under observation at the cave base camp, the federation said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. A doctor is with Dickey in the cave, and the rescue team is receiving instant messages from them through an established communications line. In a video shared by Turkey's directorate of communications on Wednesday, Dickey said that although he was \"very close to the edge,\" a quick response by Turkish authorities likely saved his life. \"As you can see I'm up, I'm alert, I'm talking. But I'm not healed on the inside yet so I'm going to need a lot of help to get out of here,\" he said, praising the caving community. \"This is often in the caving world, a great opportunity to show just how well the international world can work together. So I'm hoping to see many people from many countries all coming together. We take care of our own. And it's really special to be taken care of.\" The rescue operation, which was first announced on Monday, could take days due to the fact that the cave is deep and narrow, Bulent Genc, head of the federation, told CNN Thursday, adding that it can take 15 hours for an experienced caver to reach the surface in ideal conditions. A rescue mission at this depth is \"very rare, extremely difficult\" and needs \"many very experienced cave rescuers,\" according to the ECRA, which is involved in the operation. Gretchen Baker, from National Cave Rescue Commission (NCRC), who has known and worked with Dickey for several years and has been in communication with the rescue team, expressed cautious optimism about Dickey's safe passage out of the cave. In an interview with CNN's Isa Soares on Thursday, Baker said \"the team on the ground is very happy that Mark's condition seems to be improving, so that it looks like that he will not have to be in a [ rescue ] litter the entire way out.\" \"The more he can help, the faster the rescue can go,\" she said. Despite Dickey's improving medical situation, Baker said even with him helping, the rescue operation still has some way to go. \"We're anticipating that it will take days to get him out of the cave,\" she said.

The week began with WTI crude hitting a 10-month high of over $85 a barrel due to Saudi Arabia and Russia's decision to extend production cuts through 2023, sparking inflation and interest rate concerns. Concurrently, the U.S. dollar and Treasury yields rose as investors anticipated the Federal Reserve's moves.

        "description": "Here\u2019s a look at every Tesla model, along with its maximum battery range and MSRP.",
        "content": "Tesla models offer some of the longest EV driving ranges available, but what about battery life, warranty coverage, and replacement costs? by: Posted: Updated: ( ) \u2014 The benefits of switching from a combustion engine to an electric car include zero tailpipe emissions, rapid acceleration, and avoiding the unpredictable (often volatile) price of gasoline. But buyers considering an electric vehicle have their own concerns, which can range from access to charging stations to real-world driving range to the time required for EV charging. And then there\u2019s the big question: What is the lifespan of these EV battery packs, and how much does battery replacement cost? Tesla, the most successful electric vehicle company in the world, has done its best to address these concerns. The automaker built an extensive Tesla supercharger network of more than 35,000 fast charging stations, making coast-to-coast road trips a real-world option for road warriors. Tesla owners can also purchase the Tesla Wall Connector charger for between $750 and $1,500, for recharging their vehicle at home. Tesla vehicles provide some of the largest battery sizes available in an EV, with the Tesla Model S rated at up to 405 miles of range from its 105 kilowatt hour battery capacity. That same battery can be charged at a supercharger station at the rate of 200 miles in 15 minutes, though like all lithium-ion batteries, Tesla car batteries charge faster below 80%, then slow as they reach a full charge. This process of battery management during charging helps prolong the battery\u2019s lifespan. Home charging with the Wall Connector will be slower, adding between 10 miles and 44 miles per hour of charge, depending on the house\u2019s circuit breakers and output capacity. Here\u2019s a look at every Tesla model, along with its maximum battery range and MSRP: Many consumers don\u2019t know this, but every EV battery, from the 150-mile Nissan Leaf to the 520-mile Lucid Air, comes with an 8-year/100,000-mile warranty as required by federal law. California requires an even lengthier 10-year/150,000-mile warranty for electric car batteries. Given how many EVs are sold in California, you can safely assume every new battery powering an electric vehicle is engineered to meet California\u2019s requirement, even if it\u2019s sold in another state. Better still, Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s CEO, claims every new Tesla battery should last between 300,000 and 500,000 miles. The U.S. Department of Energy uses 15,000 miles a year as its assumed standard range of annual driving for consumers, which would put Tesla\u2019s battery life at between 20 and 33 years. Assuming a single charge a day, that timeframe would involve between 7,300 and 12,045 charge cycles. Is Tesla\u2019s battery technology really robust enough to handle that type of long-term use without a substantial loss in energy storage, and an associated drop in driving range? Because Tesla hasn\u2019t been selling cars for 20 years, yet, there\u2019s no way to test Elon\u2019s claim. But with over 3 million Teslas sold so far there have been relatively few reports of battery modules failing. And as noted above, if serious battery degradation does occur, it will likely be covered under a warranty. However, in the rare case a Tesla battery fails and isn\u2019t covered, it\u2019s reasonable to assume a replacement cost of between $10,000 and $20,000. Bottom line, an electric car\u2019s battery life shouldn\u2019t be a concern for consumers looking to buy a new \u2013 or even used \u2013 EV. This includes new and used Tesla models, which are unlikely to experience battery failure, and will probably be under warranty if they do. Of course you\u2019ll want to check the current mileage and vehicle history of any used EV you\u2019re looking to buy to ensure a battery warranty is in place and no past incidents (i.e. major accident, flood damage) have occurred that might have damaged the battery pack.

About High-Yield Accounts High-yield savings accounts aren't the only accounts paying favorable rates right now. You'll typically see the highest rates at online or lower-profile institutions rather than national brands with a significant brick and mortar presence. This is normal; online banks have lower overhead cost and are willing to pay high rates to attract new customers. High-Yield Savings Accounts The best high-yield savings accounts provide the security of a savings account with the added bonus of a high APY. Savings accounts are held at a bank or credit union \u2014 not invested through a brokerage account \u2014 and are best for saving cash in pursuit of shorter-term goals, like a vacation or big purchase. High-Yield Checking Accounts The best high-yield checking accounts tend to pay slightly lower rates than high-yield savings, but even they are strong in today's rate environment. A checking account is like a hub for your money: If your paycheck is direct deposited, it's typically to a checking account. If you transfer money to pay a bill, you typically do it from a checking account. Checking accounts are used for everyday spending and usually come with checks and/or debit cards to make that easy. Money Market Accounts The best money market accounts could be considered a middle ground between checking and savings: They are used for saving money but typically provide easy access to your account through checks or a debit card. They usually offer a tiered interest rate depending on your balance. Cash Management Accounts A cash management account is also like a savings/checking hybrid. You'll generally see them offered by online banks, and, unlike a checking account, they usually offer unlimited transfers. A savings account often limits the number of monthly transfers, while a checking account doesn't. Cash management accounts typically come with a debit card for easy access, but you may have to pay a fee if you want to deposit cash. Certificates of Deposit The best CD rates may outpace any of the other accounts we've described above. That's because a certificate of deposit requires you to \"lock in\" your money for a predetermined amount of time ranging from three months to five years. To retrieve it before then, you'll pay a penalty (unless you opt for one of the best no-penalty CDs ). The longer you'll let the bank hold your money, the higher rate you'll get. CD rates aren't variable; the rate you get upon depositing your money is the rate you'll get for the length of your term. About CD Terms Locking your money into an account in exchange for a higher interest rate can be a big decision. Here's what you need to know about common CD terms. No-Penalty CDs Most CDs charge you a fee if you need to withdraw money from your account before the term ends. But with a no-penalty CD, you won't have to pay an early withdrawal penalty. The best no-penalty CDs will offer rates slightly higher than the best high-yield savings accounts , and can offer a substantially improved interest rate over traditional brick-and-mortar savings accounts. 6-Month CDs The best 6-month CDs are offering interest rates in the mid-5% range. Six-month CDs are best for those who are looking for elevated rates on their savings for short-term gains, but are uncomfortable having limited access to their cash in the long term. These can be a good option for those who may just be getting started with saving, or who don't have a large emergency fund for unexpected expenses. 1-Year CDs The best 1-year CDs tend to offer some of the top CD rates, and are a popular option for many investors. A 1-year term can be an attractive option for someone building a CD ladder , or for someone who has a reasonable cash safety net but is still concerned about long-term expenses. 2-Year CDs The best 2-year CD rates will be slightly lower than 1-year and no-penalty CD rates. In exchange for a longer lock-in period, investors receive a long-term commitment for a specific rate. These are best used as part of a CD ladder strategy, or for those worried about a declining rate market in the foreseeable future. 3-Year CDs The best 3-year CDs tend to have rates that are comparable to 2-year CDs. These are usually less popular for your average investor, but can be an important lever when diversifying investments and hedging against the risk of unfavorable rate markets in the long term. 5-Year CDs The best 5-year CDs will offer lower rates than the other terms on our list, but are still popular options for investors. These CDs are best for those looking to lock in high rates for the long term. CDs are generally viewed as safe investment vehicles, and securing a favorable rate can yield considerable earnings in year three and beyond \u2014 even if rates fall elsewhere.

        "content": "Walt Disney Co. has tentatively agreed to pay $9.5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit over the Magic Key pass program at Disneyland. The lawsuit \u2014 filed in 2021 by Dream Key pass holder Jenale Nielsen \u2014 alleged Disney had advertised that that particular pass, its most expensive offer, would not have any blackout dates. Upon buying the $1,399 annual pass in September 2021, a month after Disney remodeled its annual pass program under the Magic Key moniker, Nielsen found she was not able to reserve a ticket for much of November, despite single- and multi-day tickets still being available for the time period. She soon discovered additional restrictions, according to the lawsuit. An agreement to settle the suit was initially announced, without specifics, in July. The preliminary agreement unveiled Friday covers 103,435 Dream Key pass holders, all of whom will be automatically enrolled to receive a disbursement from the $9.5-million fund unless they request to be excluded. The total amount to be disbursed will be determined after several deductions, including attorneys\u2019 fees for both parties, a service award for Nielsen and an estimated $147,547 in administrative costs for the settlement administrator. The preliminary agreement estimates each class member will receive about $67.41, though there could be a second round of payments depending on how much remains after initial distribution and fees. \u201cWe are satisfied that this matter has been resolved,\u201d Disney officials said in an email statement to The Times in July. Attorneys for Nielsen did not immediately reply to a request for comment Friday. The settlement is due to be finalized in federal court on Oct. 7. Times staff writer Keri Blakinger contributed to this report.",

(Sep)NOTE: Previews are listed in day orderNORWEGIAN CPI (MON): The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced.UK UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES (TUE): Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end.UK GDP ESTIMATE (WED): A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought.US CPI (WED): Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern.ECB ANNOUNCEMENT (THU): 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%.AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYMENT (THU): participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms.SWEDISH CPIF (THU): July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak.US RETAIL SALES (THU): Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July. While the data set will offer a glimpse on the health of the consumer amid concerns that the economy may slow significantly in the months ahead, traders will also be watching the University of Michigan's prelim survey release due Friday, where the rise in energy prices is likely to have weighed on sentiment.CHINESE ACTIVITY DATA (FRI): Retail sales Y/Y in August are expected to rise by 2.8% (prev. 2.5%), whilst there is currently no consensus for Industrial Production metrics. The data will be closely watched to diagnose the health of the world\u2019s second-larger economy and to gauge the drip-feed of stimulus seen over recent weeks. Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d.This article originally appeared on Newsquawk This article was written by Newsquawk Analysis at www.forexlive.com.",

Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d. This article originally appeared on",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips In today\u2019s Market360, we\u2019ll reveal the real reason why the PPI disappointed this week. We\u2019ll also review the CPI numbers, and I\u2019ll explain why the latest inflation data is so important. The post Introducing the AI System Designed to Make Investors Money appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "A Note From Louis: Over the past year, Luke Lango and his team have covertly developed what our executives are internally calling \u201cthe biggest and boldest initiative ever launched in InvestorPlace history.\u201d This initiative uses artificial intelligence to pick the best breakout stocks. Specifically, they have created an AI-powered algorithmic trading system that their research shows can consistently crush the market. Their \u201c Prometheus \u201d system doesn\u2019t tell us the best AI stocks to buy. Instead, it uses AI to pick the best stocks ripe for a price breakout. And now Luke and his team are ready to debut their AI system to the public. They\u2019re doing so during a special video demo on Tuesday, September 12, at 7 p.m. Eastern. You can click here now to reserve your spot . Meanwhile, I\u2019ve invited Luke to share a bit more about his new AI system with you folks. Here he is\u2026 ********* Imagine knowing, with a quantified measure of certainty, that a stock will either go up or down significantly over the next few weeks. I\u2019m sure it would make a world of difference for your investment strategy. Prometheus provides that certainty. It\u2019s an AI system trained on hundreds of thousands of financial market data points. And its singular goal is to pinpoint the exact moment a stock is ready to surge higher. It leverages more than 50 technical and fundamental factors to tailor AI models for every applicable stock in the market. And it uses that data to ascertain the probability for a major breakout in a stock over the next month. That is, Prometheus scans the entire stock market every week, and then uses that timely data to gauge the probability that a given stock will surge higher in price over the next few weeks. The higher the score, the more likely the stock is to surge over the next month. The lower the score, the less likely. Sounds awesome, right? Over and over, we\u2019ve back-tested this model\u2026 and it has produced stunning results. Just a few weeks ago, we also started using it in real time. And it helped us find one stock that has since popped more than 50% in just a week! Point being: Prometheus works. It is an absolute game-changer. And on Tuesday night, my team and I will debut Prometheus to the public for the very first time ( you can sign up for our event by going here ). But before we do, we must first explain why Prometheus is such a strong system and, more broadly, why using AI makes so much sense when it comes to picking stocks\u2026 AI Is All About the Data When it comes to AI, it\u2019s all about the data . At its essence, artificial intelligence is a collection of machine learning algorithms that parse through and learn from various data points. The more data you give those \u201calgos,\u201d the better the AI becomes. Specifically, AI needs the so-called \u201c4 V\u2019s\u201d of data to be a robust tool: volume, variety, velocity, and veracity . AI needs a lot of data (volume), different types of data (variety), a constant flow of data (velocity), and accurate data (veracity). You throw a bunch of high-volume, high-variety, high-velocity, and high-veracity data at an AI model, and that model will kick butt and take names. And the financial markets provide exactly that. Every single weekday, from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern, the U.S. stock market is open. It\u2019s taking buy orders, sell orders, options contracts, and more \u2013 billions of them, every single day. The average daily volume across the Nasdaq Composite index is 5 billion shares. That\u2019s 5 billion buy and sell transactions a day \u2013 5 billion data points for Prometheus to train on every single day. And each one of those data points leads to a whole host of others. For example, every time a stock changes in price, even by just a penny, it produces entirely new relative strength index ( RSI ) data points, moving average data points, McClellan Oscillator data points, etc. Every time a stock moves, it generates more than 50 alternative data points through all the technical indicators associated with it. That\u2019s more than 50 alternative data points for each of the 5 billion data points the Nasdaq Composite generates every single day. That means, across the Nasdaq alone, the stock market generates more than 250 billion data points across thousands of stocks. Talk about volume, variety, velocity, and veracity. Start Driving Profits With AI Now As the old saying goes, people speak with their dollars. That makes the stock market a utopia for training AI models. This is why we\u2019re already seeing some of the smartest folks on Wall Street deploy advanced AI models to make money in the markets. For example, major firm Voya Investment Management is actively using AI models to help craft strategies across stocks, bonds, and more. Those models are doing exceptionally well. As of June, they were beating the S&P 500 by about 2:1. I\u2019m confident that within five years every major investment firm on Wall Street, every professional trader, and every hedge fund, mutual fund, and family office will be using AI to pick stocks. Those who do not adopt an AI-powered investment strategy will get left behind\u2026 Perhaps permanently. So, if you want to be on the winning side of the market, join us Tuesday evening , September 12, at 7 p.m. Eastern . That\u2019s when we unveil our new AI-powered Prometheus trading system for the very first time. It\u2019ll mark a huge step in your journey toward turning AI into your ultimate advantage \u2013 your ultimate tool for creating wealth in this new economy. If you want to start getting in front of stocks before they jump 100% or more with near-mathematical-precision\u2026 Then sign up for my video demo next week by clicking here. We\u2019ll see you there! Sincerely, Luke Lango Editor, Hypergrowth Investing",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Stock market crash concerns are all over Wall Street ahead of next week's CPI report, which will inform the Fed's upcoming rate hike decision. The post Stock Market Crash Alert: Mark Your Calendars for Sept. 13 appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "With concerns of a recession \u2014 or stock market crash \u2014 in full swing, next week\u2019s Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) report represents perhaps the single most important economic data release ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s upcoming policy decision. Indeed, the CPI report may offer insight into whether the Fed\u2019s war on inflation is coming to a soft or emergency landing. After a surprising increase in prices in July, economists are crossing their fingers that price growth cooled in August. The headline CPI rose 3.2% on an annual basis in July, the first acceleration in more than a year. July\u2019s hotter-than-expected inflation has stoked fears that the Fed may push the rate hike button again soon. As such, next week\u2019s CPI report may force the Fed\u2019s hand at its next policy meeting, Sept. 19-20. With just days between the August CPI and the FOMC meeting, the inflation data will likely prove Fed members\u2019 final consideration before coming to a decision. And what a decision it will be. Even with fears of an imminent economic pullback eating up Wall Street, members of the Fed still aren\u2019t satisfied with the current 5.5% benchmark rate. At the annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted that rates are liable to remain elevated \u2014 or even increase \u2014 in the foreseeable future. \u201cWe are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective,\u201d he said. Recession Indicators Loom Large The major concern here is that should inflation come in higher than expected, the Fed may be pressed to raise rates yet again, a possibility that further aggravates recessionary tension in in the U.S. economy. Now, the soft-landers will argue that metrics like unemployment and consumer spending, which typically deteriorate during a recession, have been surprisingly resilient. Which has been true, at least, until recently. Indeed, the latest jobs report showed a surprising 0.3% increase in unemployment, to 3.8%, the highest level since February 2022. While this is still historically fairly strong, it also offers some validity to those suggesting an interest rate-induced recession is on the way. \u201cThe labor market is clearly cooling, with job openings falling and job growth slowing closer to sustainable levels based on the most recent data, but remains tight,\u201d said Goldman Sachs\u2019 Joseph Briggs . While 3.8% unemployment isn\u2019t itself bad, it\u2019s the suggestion that it may just be the start of a wider, more malicious downturn that has economists and analysts terrified. There\u2019s some data that suggest that consumer spending has largely been propped up by savings and debt expenditures. In fact, credit card debt recently hit $1 trillion for the first time in history. Will the CPI Cause a Stock Market Crash? The fear is that a red-hot inflation report will invite more rate hikes, which will likely invite a slowdown in hiring, which will, in itself, invite a reversal in spending. When consumer spending falls, so do earnings. And when earnings crash, well, so does the wider stock market. The notion that the economy hasn\u2019t fully digested the full brunt of the Fed\u2019s previous rate hikes is an even more terrifying suggestion, given the overwhelming expectation that the central bank isn\u2019t done raising rates yet. Should everything hit all at once, the notion of a soft landing quickly devolves into an emergency landing as the economy slips into recession.

Energy is the one safe haven in September so far. In between earnings season, the market defaults to economic data for guidance and how that may impact earnings estimates. Right now what the bond market does is leading stocks, by being a vote on inflation trends that will drive the Fed\u2019s monetary moves. This week we\u2019ve watched the US 10yr go from below 4.20% to above 4.30%, and today back to just above 4.21% this morning. Stocks have generally followed these moves, though have taken more heat than bonds moves as the volatility on top of the cautious consideration of the weak seasonality of September has created more sellers than buyers. As of Friday morning, for the first 5 trading days of September we find the Dow down 0.9%, the S&P down 1.25%, both the NASDAQ and QQQ down 1.5%, with the Russell 2000 bringing up the rear at down 3.3%. The bias is to bigger, higher quality companies, though the megatech have certainly revealed they too react to interest rates. Things would be better without the noise in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has seen its worst worst back-to-back losses in almost 3 years on the news about China instructing government employees to not bring an iPhone to work. This has wiped out $200B in market value, though it is bouncing this morning, up 1.3% and still up 43.5% YTD. Energy prices are up again, with crude back over $87.50 and the XLE up 3% in September. Looking forward to next week, we\u2019ll get the CPI data on Wednesday, with forecasts for the headline to be higher and core to be flat. PPI rolls out Thursday and has the same trends expected in the forecasts. Importantly, have fallen to almost zero increase y-o-y, despite 94% occupancy rates, due to massive new supply, a 50-year high, and will be phased in over the months ahead putting downward pressure on inflation stats. Expectations are almost a consensus that the Fed will skip an increase on September 20th, so the tea leaf reading is not nearly as important as it would be if a Fed increase was a real possibility. Recession fears continue to ebb and earnings estimates remain firm or inching higher. With weakness continuing in , and Europe appearing headed for a recession, the US should continue to see investment flows coming our way, and help us get to the 4th quarter without too much further damage.

Following Sep 8, 2023, 09:25am EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin High inflation is more than a tax on everyday spending, it also impacts longer run costs through higher interest rates. Chart 1 shows the relationship between inflation (blue line), interest rates (orange line), and the rate paid by small business owners on their loans (gray line). The recent decline from near 10% inflation rates should work its way through to lower interest rates for consumer and businesses, assuming no \u201csetbacks\u201d like those experienced in the late 1970s and early 1980s. But just how much depends on what lenders \u201cexpect\u201d inflation to be in the future when loans are repaid. Inflation and Interest Rates. BLS, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, NFIB NFIB Here\u2019s how the transmission of inflation to interest rates works. Suppose a friend wanted to borrow $100 from you. You\u2019d have to take the money out of your bank account and give up any interest it would have earned. So, what interest will you charge? At least you would charge what the bank was paying you. But the loan is being paid back in the future, and with inflation rampant, that $100 won\u2019t buy the same amount of stuff it did when you made the loan. You need to add something to the rate to cover inflation. And how well do you know your \u201cfriend\u201d? There is a chance that the loan won\u2019t be repaid, interest or principal. You need to add an insurance premium to the rate you charge. This is the process that goes on in credit markets. A simple formula outlines the rate determination: Interest Rate = Risk Free Return + Risk Premium + Expected Inflation The risk-free return for any loan maturity can be determined from the yield on Treasury bonds and notes. For example, the 10-year Treasury bond yield will tell you what you could earn with your money with certainty if you loaned it to the government. The Risk Premium is the most difficult to calculate. Are you lending to Walmart or one individual? Check their financial statements if available and their credit score. If you made a lot of $100 loans you could look at the average loss experience. This is basically what banks do when making loans to many small businesses vs. a large well-established company. Then there is the inflation premium. Loan dollars repaid in an inflationary future lose purchasing power. If the dollars repaid will purchase 10% less stuff, your 5% interest is wiped out. Lenders must \u201cpredict\u201d future inflation to set their lending rates. The longer the maturity, the harder it is to forecast future inflation. Consider the inflation risk in a 20- or 30-year mortgage. Lenders are continually processing new information about the economy and borrowers to set their loan rates, but it\u2019s costly and imprecise (risky). Bond markets do provide some clues. The Treasury issues \u201cindexed bonds\u201d which increase in maturity value by the CPI inflation rate each year. With no risk from default or from inflation, the yield on those bonds compared to the yield on regular Treasury bonds reveals the \u201cmarket\u2019s\u201d view of the inflation premium for any given maturity. In 1981, the 10-year Treasury bond yielded 14.8%, and buying those guaranteed that yield for 10 years! The yield on the Indexed 10-year Treasury bond was 11.4%. The CPI inflation rate was 13.5% (1980:2), roughly the same as the inflation premium. With no default risk, the difference measures what investors were demanding for inflation protection after 1980 and Fed actions. Small business owners reported paying an average rate of 19.4 (1981:4), indicating an average risk premium of over 7%. Banks could always lend their money to the government, a safer alternative but a much lower interest rate (risk vs return tradeoff). The importance of dealing with inflation is obvious from the formula for interest rate determination. If no one expects future inflation, the inflation premium is 0 and interest rates will be lower. The prime rate of interest in the 1980s reached 21%, mostly because inflation was running at double digit rates, virtually guaranteeing an inflation loss on money repaid even in the very short run. Lower inflation means a lower tax at the cash register but also lower interest rates on credit cards, auto loans, and mortgages into the future.

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Shares of Apple are falling after China restricts use of iPhones. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty ... [+] Images) Getty Images Key Takeaways Apple AAPL Under Pressure Disney At Lowest Level In Nearly A Decade Volatility Still Low The big news this week has been the drop in Apple. Following an order from Chinese officials forbidding state workers from using iPhones and other foreign made phones, shares of Apple have come under pressure. Yesterday alone, Apple lost 2.9% and has lost $190 billion in market capitalization in just the past two days. According to an article in the Wall Street Journal, Apple owned 65% of the Chinese market for mobile phones priced over $600. China also accounted for 24% of all iPhone shipments in the second quarter, outpacing the U.S.\u2019s 21%. The ban on state employees has potential to trickle down to Chinese citizens and could seriously threaten Apple\u2019s biggest market. Apple isn\u2019t the only stock struggling this week. Shares of Disney closed at their lowest level since 2014. Investors had hoped Bob Iger\u2019s return would help turn the stock around, but the company has continued to languish. Disney is down a little over 1% for the week. Elsewhere, energy stocks continued their push higher of late. The energy component of the S&P 500 was the strongest performing sector yesterday, up 1.3% and is up 18% from its late June lows. The sector has seen a lot of activity of late, especially with crude oil prices surging. Our customers at tastytrade have been active both in listed and futures products tied to the sector. There is no major economic news today, but next week we will get a read on consumer prices. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is scheduled for release next. Analysts are looking for a month-over-month increase of 0.5% and for core CPI to be up 0.2% month-over-month. That number will be interesting to watch because, as I mentioned above, market\u2019s feel a bit stuck at the moment, and a reading outside of what is expected could be what markets need to get unstuck.

New Pixel 8 Pro Leaks Reveal Google s Smart Decision On Wednesday, I talked about 4460 in the S&P 500 being a support level many market technicians were watching. We have since fallen below that level, so we\u2019ll see if what was once support becomes resistance. Those same technicians are now looking for market support at 4410. One interesting thing to note here is the level of market volatility. Despite some big name companies taking hits this week, the VIX is still below 15. That is well below its historical average. Therefore, there isn\u2019t that sense of panic you might normally expect given some of the weakness we\u2019ve seen in the tech sector.

        "description": "Monday:ECB\u2019s Wunsch (hawk \u2013 non voter) remains in favour of raising interest rates again:Underlying inflation remains persistent, may need more rate hikes.I\u2019m inclined to say we maybe need to do a little bit more.The idea that we\u2019ll have to come to a pause at a certain point can\u2019t be excluded, but it\u2019s too early to talk about stopping hiking completely.The Switzerland Q2 GDP missed expectations as the monetary tightening is starting to bite more heavily:GDP Q2 0.0% vs. 0.1% expected and 0.3% prior. ECB\u2019s Lagarde (hawk \u2013 voter) is focused on the inflation expectations and keeping them in check:It is exactly when people are paying most attention that central banks should deliver their key communication to ensure that those expectations remain firmly anchored.It will be critical for central banks to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored while these relative price changes play out.Tuesday:Chinese Caixin Services PMI missed expectations by a big margin although remaining in expansion:Services PMI 51.8 vs. 53.6 expected and 54.1 prior.The RBA left the cash rate unchanged as expected at 4.10%: Inflation in Australia has passed its peak. But inflation is still too high and will remain so for some time yet.The Australian economy is experiencing a period of below-trend growth. Returning inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe remains the priority. There are significant uncertainties around the outlook.Services price inflation has been surprisingly persistent overseas and the same could occur in Australia.Some further tightening of monetary policy may be required.Will continue to pay close attention to developments in the global economy, trends in household spending, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market.ECB\u2019s Lane (dove \u2013 voter) didn\u2019t offer much in terms of forward guidance:August inflation data is welcome, but we need to see that continue.We do expect bumpiness in easing of energy, food inflation.Easing in services inflation helps limit narrative that tourism is keeping services inflation high.The Eurozone July PPI beat expectations, but the figures were still all negative:PPI M/M -0.5% vs. -0.6% expected and -0.4% prior.PPI Y/Y -7.6% vs. -7.6% expected and -3.4% prior. ECB\u2019s Schnabel (hawk \u2013 voter) touched on climate change and how it could bring downside tail risks:Climate change is an existential threat with large downside tail risks.Climate-related and environmental risks (C&E risks) are now an important focal point for supervisors.Climate change constitutes an existential threat, implying large downside tail risks.Dealing with financial risks is the core of prudential supervision. Physical climate risks tend to be correlated globally.The economic consequences of physical climate risks could be mitigated by closing the large climate insurance protection gap.In the EU, only a quarter of losses caused by climate-related catastrophes are insured.Fed\u2019s Waller (hawk \u2013 voter) changed his stance and he\u2019s now leaning towards a pause:I would say the risks to doing too much and too little are balanced.The data last week clearly showed the jobs market is starting to soften. Unemployment is about where it was a year ago, so change isn't that big.Recessions are often caused by shocks that come out of nowhere, but the data so far is pretty good (for a soft landing).I want to be very careful to say that 'we've done the job'.I want to see 'a couple months' of data.I don't think one more hike would send the economy into a recession.Data will drive whether the Fed hikes again.Recent data will allow the Fed to proceed carefully.We're starting to see the economy slow down.Treasury yields are about where they should be.The US economy is 'about 80% closed' so impacts from abroad will be smaller than for others.We've been keeping a very close eye on commercial real estate, will continue to roll over during the next 2 years or so.We're not sure about what prices CRE will be trading at in two years.Saudi Arabia announced that it would extend the voluntary 1 million barrels per day output cut through December and Russia quickly followed by saying it was cutting exports by 300k bpd through year end. Both added that caveat that the decision would be reviewed monthly. Fed\u2019s Mester (hawk \u2013 non voter) maintained her hawkish stance as she sees the need to go a \u201clittle bit\u201d higher on rates:The labour market has come more into balance.From what I see so far, we might have to go a bit higher, we might have to raise the policy rate a bit more.There is still a lot of time before our next decision in September and we will get a lot of data and information by then.Gasoline prices are rising again. We have to be very attentive to that.The longer inflation stays above 2%, the more likely it is that the risks will materialise.If we end up raising interest rates too much and the economy loses momentum more than necessary, we can lower interest rates.We will certainly not continue to raise interest rates until inflation has already fallen to 2%. Nor will we wait to lower interest rates until inflation is at 2%.There are upside risks to our inflation forecasts, in my view.Wednesday:The Australian Q2 GDP beat expectations:GDP Q2 0.4% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% prior.BoJ\u2019s Takata sounded optimistic on hitting the inflation target but remains wary of downside risks:Japan is seeing early signs of hitting 2% inflation.Japan's economy is recovering moderately.He believes that the Bank of Japan must patiently maintain easy monetary policy given the very high uncertainty on the outlook.At the same time, BOJ must respond nimbly to uncertainty with eye on economic, price outlook.There's a chance Japan will see shift in public perception prices and wages won't rise much.Japan seeing signs of change in corporate wage, price-setting behaviour.There is sign of change in Japan's trend inflation as rising wages push up inflation expectations.Inflation is already exceeding BOJ's 2% target but there is some distance to achieving it stably and in sustainable fashion.If overseas economies slow sharply, that could weigh on Japan's economy.Stronger than expected US economy having an impact on currencies.Overseas factors having greater impact on currencies.We need to stand ready to flexibly respond to uncertainty.Action in July was a flexible response.ECB\u2019s Villeroy (neutral \u2013 voter) is leaning more towards keeping interest rates high for longer rather than raising them more:There is a slowdown but no recession.Had first successes against inflation but need to persevere.Must bring inflation down to 2% level between now and 2025.We are near or very near the peak on interest rates.Our options are open at the next and upcoming rate meetings.Maintaining rates for a sufficiently long period now counts more than further rate hikes.ECB\u2019s Knot (hawk \u2013 voter) didn\u2019t sound much confident on a September rate hike:Markets may be underestimating September rate hike chances.Bringing inflation to 2% by the end of 2025 is the bare minimum.Rate hike is a possibility, not a certainty.The Eurozone July Retail Sales missed expectations on the M/M figure but beat on the Y/Y one:Retail Sales M/M -0.2% vs. -0.1% expected and 0.2% prior (revised from -0.3%).Retail Sales Y/Y -1.0% vs. -1.2% expected and -1.0% prior (revised from -1.0%).ECB\u2019s Kazimir (hawk \u2013 voter) favours one last rate hike:The preferable option would be to hike rates by 25 bps next week.One more, likely last rate hike, still needed.The alternative option would be to hike in October or December.Inflation remains stubbornly high, price growth expectations too far above 2%.Fed\u2019s Collins (neutral \u2013 non voter) is leaning towards a high for longer stance rather than a higher for longer one:It's time for monetary policy to be patient and deliberate.Fed should 'allow time' when making monetary policy choices.Too soon to say inflation sustainably moving back to target.Fed must balance lowering inflation against slowing economy too much.Fed can likely achieve goals without causing notable economic pain.Still too much job market demand.Wage growth remains elevated.Core services inflation moderation has been modest.Expects economy to slow into end of year.BoE\u2019s Bailey (neutral \u2013 voter) is expecting a \u201cmarked\u201d fall in inflation by year-end:Wage bargaining has surprised to the upside.There has been a very large terms of trade shock in this country.Many indicators are signalling a fall in inflation, which will be marked by the end of this year.Question is: As headline inflation comes down, will we see inflation expectations continue to come down and will that impact wage bargaining?There is not group think at the MPC at the moment.BoE\u2019s Dhingra (dove \u2013 voter) maintains her dovish stance as she expects the monetary policy lags to start affecting the economy more heavily:Labour market continues to ease as MPC's hiking cycle takes effect with a lag.Pass-through of level changes to wages would not necessarily pose a risk to our target in the medium term.Not yet evidence to suggest firms will seek to increase their margins.Domestic factors are likely to continue to ease the pressure on CPI inflation.The Bank of Canada kept interest rates steady at 5.00% as expected:The Canadian economy has entered a period of weaker growth. The tightness in the labour market has continued to ease gradually. Recent CPI data indicate that inflationary pressures remain broad-based. With the recent increase in gasoline prices, CPI inflation is expected to be higher in the near term before easing again. With recent evidence that excess demand in the economy is easing, and given the lagged effects of monetary policy, Governing Council decided to hold the policy interest rate at 5%.Governing Council remains concerned about the persistence of underlying inflationary pressures, and is prepared to increase the policy interest rate further if needed. Growth prospects in China have diminished. In the United States, growth was stronger than expected.The US ISM Services PMI beat expectations by a big margin coming at 54.5 vs. 52.5 expected and 52.7 prior:employment index 54.7 vs. 50.7 prior.new orders index 57.5 vs. 55.0 prior.prices paid index 58.9 vs. 56.8 prior.new export orders 62.1 vs. 61.1 prior.imports 52.3 vs. 52.3 prior.backlog of orders 41.8 vs. 52.1 prior.inventories 57.7 vs. 50.4 prior.supplier deliveries 48.5 vs. 48.1 prior.inventory sentiment 61.5 vs. 56.6 prior.The Fed release the Beige Book which provides recent anecdotal information on current economic conditions: Most Districts indicated economic growth was modest during July and August. Consumer spending on tourism was stronger than expected but other retail spending continued to slow, especially non-essential.Some Districts highlighted reports suggesting consumers may have exhausted their savings and are relying more on borrowing to support spending. New auto sales did expand in many Districts, but contacts noted this had more to do with better availability of inventory rather than increased consumer demand. Manufacturing contacts in several Districts also noted that supply chain delays improved. New orders were stable or declined in most Districts, and backlogs shortened. Nearly all Districts reported the inventory of homes for sale remained constrained.Some Districts reported higher delinquencies on consumer credit lines.Job growth was subdued across the nation. Nearly all Districts indicated businesses renewed their previously unfulfilled expectations that wage growth will slow broadly in the near term.Most Districts reported price growth slowed overall, decelerating faster in manufacturing and consumer-goods sectors.Thursday:BoJ Nakagawa thinks that it\u2019s appropriate to maintain easy monetary policy for now but there are signs that inflation is on path to achieve their target and the risk that it could even accelerate more than expected:Appropriate to maintain easy monetary policy for time being.Signs of change seen in Japan's corporate price, wage-setting behaviour.Still not at stage where we can say Japan has stably, sustainably achieved BOJ\u2019s price targetMonetary easing involves various side-effects.BOJ will conduct flexible market operation when 10-year JGB yield moves in range of 0.5-1.0% range with eye on interest rate levels and speed of moves.BOJ\u2019s July decision has heightened sustainability of its monetary easing framework.Japan's capex, consumption increasing moderately.Japan's economy likely to continue recovering moderately.Our baseline scenario is for consumer inflation to gradually re-accelerate after a period of slowdown.There is chance inflation could accelerate more than expected, though there is also chance pass-through of costs could moderate.Job market tightening but outlook for wages also depends on corporate earnings.Price rises for goods broadening, service prices also rising mainly for accommodation fees.Must be vigilant to risk of further slowdown in global growth.Sees equal degree of upside and downside risks to inflation.Can exit NIRP when economy is strong enough.But there is no preset idea on order or timing of that.It depends on financial developments at the time.Does not want to comment on FX levels.Strong outcome in next year's wage talks would be a necessary condition, though not a sufficient one to contemplate pursuing end of negative rates.Want to look at various factors beyond wages in deciding future policy changes.Further YCC tweak cannot be ruled out but is not an imminent issue now.The Chinese trade data beat expectations but the readings remain very poor:Exports Y/Y -8.8% vs. -9.2% expected and -14.5% prior. Imports Y/Y -7.3% vs. -9.0% expected and -12.4% prior. RBA\u2019s Lowe gave his final speech as Governor as Deputy Governor Bullock will take over as the new head on September 18:My recent focus is risk wages, profits run ahead of rates consistent with return to inflation target.If this risk materialised and inflation became sticky, would require tighter monetary policy.Will be difficult to return to the earlier world in which inflation tracked in a very narrow range.Inflation is likely to be more variable around target.Australia has been well served by a flexible inflation target.Possible that Australia can sustain unemployment rates below what we have had over the past 40 years.Now in an environment of stronger growth in nominal wages, which is positive.The recent productivity record isn\u2019t encouraging; solution fundamentally a political problem.Interest rates influence housing prices but are not reason Australia has some of the highest prices in the world.Issue that defined my term more than any other was forward guidance on rates during the pandemic.Guidance was widely interpreted as a commitment, rather than a conditional statement.With the benefit of hindsight, my view is that we did do too much during pandemic.The Switzerland August seasonally adjusted Unemployment Rate remained steady at 2.1% vs. 2.1% expected and 2.1% prior. The Eurozone Q2 Final GDP reading was 0.1% vs. 0.3% expected as the previous estimate was revised to 0.1%:Household consumption flat.Government expenditure 0.1%.Gross fixed capital formation 0.1%.External balance -0.4%.Changes in inventories 0.4%.The US Jobless Claims beat expectations by a big margin across the board: Initial Claims 216K vs. 234K expected and 228K prior. Continuing Claims 1679K vs. 1715K expected and 1725K prior. The BoC Governor Macklem delivered a hawkish speech titled \"staying the course\u201d:We are concerned that progress in bringing down inflation has slowed.We are prepared to raise rates again but don't want to raise rates than we have to.The longer we wait, the harder it is likely to be to reduce inflation.Monetary policy might not be restrictive enough to restore price stability.Bank is concerned that larger-than-normal price increases for goods and services remain broad based.We are not trying to kill economic growth.The biggest contribution to the slowing in inflation since the peak last year has been from energy, which accounts for two-thirds of the slowdown.Today, about 60% of CPI components are rising above 3% and about 45% are rising above 5%.Looking ahead, we want to see less-generalized price increases as well as a decline in the average price increase.The weakness in second-quarter GDP largely reflected a broad-based slowing in consumer spending and a decline in housing activity.We will be watching wage growth closely.Maybe we don't need to do more, maybe we do on interest rates.We will take decisions meeting by meeting.Expecting growth of 'a little less than 1%' over the next few quarters.You can expect headline inflation is going to go up in the near term, before it eases.Fed\u2019s Williams (neutral \u2013 voter) just expressed the uncertainty policymakers are currently facing:Labor market balances are evening out.There's still more data to come before next FOMC meeting.Inflation is far too high but moving down.Policy is in a good place, is data dependent.We are seeing movement in the right direction for the economy.It's an open question if monetary policy is restrictive enough.The latest consumer spending data has been strong.Expects unemployment rate to rise to low 4% range.Fed\u2019s Goolsbee (dove \u2013 voter) maintains his stance as he prefers to keep rates high for longer rather than higher for longer:It's possible we can get on 'golden path'.Monetary policy is working.Overall level of inflation is above where we want it.Clearly there are risks.China, US government shutdown are among possible risks.We have also had false dawns on inflation before.Want to see progress on core inflation, especially goods and housing.Market's expectations on inflation also have a major influence.I'd pay less attention to wage growth as an indicator of inflation.We are very rapidly approaching time when are argument is not about how high should rates go, but rather how long rates have to stay high.Collectively Fed forecast is that rates will have to stay up for a relatively extended period.You can't change the inflation target until you've hit your inflation target.We have to get to the 2% inflation target, retain credibility.A possible UAW strike could have an impact, it could be material to our decisions.Fed\u2019s Logan (hawk \u2013 voter) called for a skip at the upcoming September FOMC meeting:'Could be appropriate' to skip interest-rate increase in September.There is 'work left to do' to get to sufficiently restrictive policy.Skipping does not imply stopping rate hikes.Not yet convinced we've extinguished excess inflation.Fed needs to calibrate policy 'carefully,' must proceed gradually.Significantly lower inflation in recent months 'encouraging,' but too soon to confidently say on path to 2% in timely way.Job market strength suggests we have not finished the job of restoring price stability.If stronger economic activity continues, could lead to a resurgence of inflation.Friday:Japan July Average Cash Earnings growth slowed down more, and the wages data is something the BoJ is particularly focused on:Average Cash Earnings Y/Y 1.3% vs. 2.3% prior. Real Wages Y/Y -2.5%.Household spending -5.00% vs. -4.2% prior.The Japanese Final Q2 GDP missed expectations and the previous reading was revised downwards:Japan Q2 GDP 1.2% vs. 1.3% expected and 0.8% prior (revised from 1.5%).GDP Growth Annualised 4.8% vs. 5.5% expected and 3.2% prior (revised from 6%).The Canadian Jobs report showed another pick up in wage growth which is something the BoC is particularly focused on:Employment change 39.9K vs. 20.0K expected and -6.4K prior.Full time 32.2K vs. 1.7K prior.Part time 7.8K vs. -8.1K prior.Participation rate 65.5% vs. 65.6% expected and 65.6% prior.Average hourly wages permanent employees 5.2% vs. 4.7% expected and 5.0% prior.Unemployment rate 5.5% vs. 5.6% expected and 5.5% prior.The highlights for next week will be:Tuesday: UK Labour Market report, German ZEW, US NFIB Small Business Optimism Index.Wednesday: Japan PPI, UK GDP, EZ Industrial Production, US CPI.Thursday: Australia Labour Market report, Japan Industrial Production, Switzerland PPI, ECB Policy Decision, US Jobless Claims, US PPI, US Retail Sales.Friday: NZ Manufacturing PMI, China Industrial Production and Retail Sales, Eurozone Wages data, US University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment.

        "content": "While flash floods and blizzards may be more associated with New York State when it comes to natural disasters, tornadoes can happen too. In fact, there were a reported 13 tornadoes in New York state in one day on May 31, 1998, according to . To this day, that holds the record for most tornado activity in recorded state history But we've had quite other active days for severe weather, including more recent years. A storm system in early August 2023 spawned six tornadoes across the area, in almost a decade. But how likely are you getting struck by a tornado while living in New York? Where in New York are tornadoes most prevalent? The website used data from to find the counties in New York that have experienced the most tornadoes since 2000. While tornadoes have been recorded for years before tha by meteorologists, forecast accuracy has greatly increased since the 1990s, according to There have been three recorded F4s that have touched down in New York state, according to . The first happened on August 28, 1973 in Columbia County over mostly open land, before moving into Massachusetts. Another F4 first touched down near Erie, Pennsylvania May 31, 1985, and then moved over the state line into New York. This was part of deadly outbreak of tornadoes that hit NY, PA, OH, and Ontario that same day. The third was a nearly mile-wide tornado that touched down in Montgomery County on July 10, 1989. The storm would stay on the ground for 42 miles, traveling four counties (Greene, Montgomery, Schoharie, and Albany Counties). You also have to consider that many of these weather records generally only go back to the late 1800s, so there is no telling how many storms hit before those times.",

        "description": "The magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit remote High Atlas mountain region, killing 2,012 people and leaving many homeless.",
        "content": "Rescuers searching for survivors dug through the rubble of collapsed houses in remote mountain villages of Morocco on Saturday, as armed forces were pressed into action in the wake of the country\u2019s deadliest earthquake in more than 60 years. Authorities declared three days of national mourning after the magnitude 6.8 earthquake killed more than 2,012 people and injured 2,059, with many left homeless. Morocco\u2019s King Mohammed VI ordered the armed forces to mobilise specialised search and rescue teams and a surgical field hospital, according to a statement from the military. The quake that struck in Morocco\u2019s High Atlas mountains late on Friday night damaged historic buildings in Marrakesh \u2013 the nearest city to the epicentre \u2013 while most of the fatalities were reported in mountainous areas to the south in the Al-Haouz and Taroudant provinces. In the mountain village of Tafeghaghte near the quake\u2019s epicentre, virtually no buildings were left standing. The traditional clay bricks used by the region\u2019s Berber inhabitants proved no match for the rare quake. \u201cThree of my grandchildren and their mother were killed \u2013 they are still under the rubble,\u201d villager Omar Benhanna, 72, told AFP. \u201cJust a while ago, we were all playing together.\u201d The epicentre of the earthquake was at a depth of 18.5km (11.5 miles) and occurred about 72km (44 miles) northeast of Marrakesh, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said. Lahcen Haddad, a Moroccan senator and former minister, says the authorities are responding quickly despite the many challenges, including difficult terrain. \u201cMoroccan authorities are \u2026 getting people to hospitals in Marrakesh. There has been a call to give blood. After the Al Hoceima earthquake in 2004, [authorities] put together a mega plan for a rapid intervention,\u201d he told Al Jazeera. In historic Marrakesh, people could be seen on state TV clustering in the streets, afraid to go back inside buildings that might still be unstable. The city\u2019s famous Koutoubia Mosque, built in the 12th century, was damaged but the extent was not immediately clear. Its 69-metre (226-foot) minaret is known as the \u201croof of Marrakesh\u201d. Moroccans also posted videos showing damage to parts of the famous red walls that surround the old city, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The Royal Moroccan Football Federation announced that a Cup of African Nations qualifier against Liberia, due to have been played on Saturday in the coastal city of Agadir, had been postponed indefinitely. The Red Cross said it was mobilising resources to support the Moroccan Red Crescent but its Middle East and North Africa director, Hossam Elsharkawi, warned: \u201cWe are looking at many months if not years of response.\u201d The Moroccan armed forces will deploy rescue teams to provide affected areas with clean drinking water, food supplies, tents and blankets, authorities said. In the village of Amizmiz, near the epicentre, rescue workers picked through rubble with their bare hands. Outside a hospital, about 10 bodies lay covered in blankets as grieving relatives stood nearby. \u201cWhen I felt the earth shaking beneath my feet and the house leaning, I rushed to get my kids out. But my neighbours couldn\u2019t,\u201d Mohamed Azaw told Reuters news agency. \u201cUnfortunately, no one was found alive in that family. The father and son were found dead and they are still looking for the mother and the daughter.\u201d Rescuers stood atop the pancaked floors of one building in Amizmiz, about 55km (34 miles) south of Marrakesh, bits of carpet and furniture protruding from the rubble. A long queue formed outside the only open shop as people sought supplies. Underlining the challenges facing rescuers, fallen boulders blocked a road from Amizmiz to a nearby village. Journalist Younis Ezzouhir told Al Jazeera from Marrakesh that efforts are continuing to clear roads to get to more survivors in affected areas in al-Haouz province, especially the small town of Talat N\u2019Yaaqoub and rural commune there. \u201cThis road faced landslides. It is a mountain road but the nature of the road is that the ground is mud soil, so it is fragile, and with rainfall or earthquakes there can be major amount of dirt and stones falling from the mountains,\u201d Ezzouhir said. Tremors were felt as far away as Huelva and Jaen in southern Spain. The World Health Organization said more than 300,000 people were affected in Marrakesh and surrounding areas. As news emerged of Morocco\u2019s unfolding earthquake disaster, reactions poured in from the international community. Turkey, where powerful earthquakes in February killed more than 50,000 people, was among nations expressing solidarity and offering support. Algeria, which broke off ties with Morocco in 2021 after escalating tensions between the countries focused on the Western Sahara conflict, said it would open its airspace for humanitarian and medical flights. Despite an outpouring of offers of help from around the world, the Moroccan government has not formally asked for assistance, a step required before outside rescue crews could deploy. The quake was recorded at a depth of 18.5km, typically more destructive than deeper quakes of the same magnitude. It was Morocco\u2019s deadliest earthquake since 1960 when a quake was estimated to have killed at least 12,000 people, according to the US Geological Survey.",

Ellen Burstyn , who has shown an impressive commitment to amplifying new, independent voices in her older years, plays the mother of the title, sat on a couch in an unusual vintage furniture store, refusing to get up. Her sons, played by Ewan McGregor and Rhys Ifans, and daughter, played by Lara Flynn Boyle, all try different tactics to get her to leave, aided by Taylor Russell\u2019s accommodating store-owner\u2019s daughter.

We\u2019re attached for the entirety to McGregor\u2019s put-upon problem-solver, the youngest son lumped with the responsibilities that his more wayward siblings refuse to confront, a peacekeeper growing tired of his role, helping a parent who never really helped him while also becoming a parent of potentially similar incompetence. It\u2019s his finest work for a while, the actor often blandly miscast in films that smooth down the edges that made him famous, and he tries hard, at times exhaustingly so, to add texture to a character with very little, attempting to fire up an emotional core that never really sparks (in a merciful twist, especially for McGregor, the film is accent-free, each of the three children speaking in their natural dialect). It\u2019s all one long stress dream for him and for us, the film flirting with flashes of horror as sound design and brief moments of violence that keep things uncomfortably tense, and with Burstyn\u2019s psyche disintegrating, there are scenes that recall her Requiem for a Dream breakdown, albeit with a softer touch. Larsson\u2019s skill as a director increasingly outpaces his ability as a writer and the film is visually involving even when it\u2019s narratively alienating (if nothing else, it\u2019s a remarkably assured sizzle reel for Larsson, film-maker, one that feels prepped to be mailed straight to the A24 offices). His actors remain so very committed throughout, even as the film revels in maddening incoherence, that you\u2019re tempted to believe in whatever it is they\u2019re apparently seeing. It\u2019s especially rewarding to see Boyle return in her most notable role for years, chain-smoking and barking through the chaos, convincing us that there might be a late-stage career switch to character actor for the one-time leading lady. She\u2019s so good that it\u2019s then frustrating to see her sidelined, a big introduction that fades into nothing, one of too many thinly written characters left stranded as the film descends into a nonsensically twee finale. It\u2019s all a bit of a hopeless muddle dragged to the finish line by a troupe of impressively hopeful actors giving us brief bursts of electricity, almost insisting that we stay put, but unlike Burstyn\u2019s stubborn mother you\u2019ll be itching to be somewhere, anywhere else.

        "content": "SPOILER ALERT: The story includes details about Episodes 509 ( Angel\u2019s Peak ) and 510 ( Labor Day ) of Netflix\u2019s series Virgin River . Part 1 of Virgin River \u2018s fifth season came to a close with eventful last two episodes. In typical Virgin River fashion , there were bombshell revelations \u2014 Lizzie is pregnant, baddie Calvin is the father of Charmaine\u2019s twins, and the big one is the cliffhanger that set up the upcoming Christmas-themed two-episode Part 2 \u2014 Mel\u2019s biological father is likely a man from Virgin River, identity unknown (for now).

In other developments, Jack takes Mel on a hike to Angel\u2019s Peak to have a heart-to-heart after she had pulled away following her miscarriage. They get lost and rained on, reaching the bottom physically and metaphorically before an impersonate speech by Jack ( Martin Henderson ) at the top wins Mel ( Alexandra Breckenridge ) back. The same pouring rain also interrupts a baseball game Brie had asked Mike to join and leads to the two of them kissing to kick off a new Virgin River romantic relationship. (L to R) Teryl Rothery as Muriel St. Claire, Mark Ghanime as Dr. Cameron Hayek in episode 510. Netflix Another new couple alert, Cameron and Muriel, make if official, getting permission from Doc and going public at the Labor Day Carnival, the latest in a long list of Virgin River community events featured as backdrop to major episodes on the show. Preacher and Kaia also are going from strength to strength until she gets a call that the fire clean-up has uncovered a mystery buried body, which stops Preacher in his tracks as he was the one who put that body into the ground to help Paige. After Jack and Mel get on the same page about starting a family even if not in the way they originally had envisioned, Mel takes him to Lilly\u2019s burned-down farm where part of the charred tree is still standing with the swing where the two had a sweet chat in Season 1 miraculously intact. She wants them to buy the plot of land and build their dream house to raise a family and he loves the idea. The reason why the duo needs a new property is that Jack\u2019s existing one has been temporarily seized by the FBI. The final two episodes wrapped the glamping drug scheme plot line, with Jack catching Brady (Benjamin Hollingsworth) cooking the books moments before Brady gets abducted by Melissa Montgomery\u2019s goons. With help from Mike, Jack tracks them down and Melissa is arrested but Mike gets shot in an altercation. Brie keeps vigil at his bedside and the two hang out when he finally wakes up. Doc tells Hope that he has enrolled in the risky clinical trial and she vows to support him in his decision. In an interview with Deadline, Andy Mikita, who directed Episodes 509 and 510, dissects all major plot developments and talks about new Virgin River couples while giving props to Hope and Doc, played by Annette O\u2019Toole and Tim Matheson. (\u201cThey are two of my favorite characters and favorite people and favorite actors. I can watch those two all day long.\u201d) He also describes how the Mel-Jack scene in \u201cAngel\u2019s Peak\u201d was shot using rain effects that prompted an improvisation by Breckenridge and reveals that the Labor Day carnival was filmed in pouring rain with the use of special machinery to shield the actors and conceal the inclement weather that was not written into the show. Mikita also explains the use of flashbacks in the two episodes, shares how crew members stepped in twice to serve as background performers, reveals whether Mel and Jack really go back to Lilly\u2019s farm and other behind-the-scenes details. (For a deep dive into the wildfire-themed Episodes 505 and 506, read our interview .) DEADLINE: What were the biggest challenges filming Jack and Mel\u2019s hike to Angel\u2019s Peak? MIKITA : One of the challenges certainly from a directorial standpoint, coming right from the wake of the episodes involving the fire , we had to demonstrate some areas of post-fire destruction. We had to create a bit of an aftermath and then enhance that with visual effects because you wanted it to feel the devastation of what they just experienced and with their own personal turmoil that they were both going through, with Jack really trying to reach out to Mel to try to get through to her because she had been quite distant from the end of Episode 8 and into 9. He had to coax her into going out to have a little bit of a soul-searching walk together where they could clear their minds and discuss what\u2019s happened and what the future has for them. We were checker-boarding their conversation through the rest of the episode as they are getting deeper into the forest and ultimately reach Angel\u2019s Peak, which is a beautiful mountain location in Squamish, a spectacular vista. There were some production challenges getting the crew and the equipment and everything up to that spot. The journey itself, we\u2019d broken it up into four different locations, three of which we used the same vicinity but created different environments, and the way that those things were shot, I tried to give a lot of space if that makes sense, lots of wide shots to show almost the insignificance of them as individuals in the grand scheme of the environments with those nice big, epic wide shots combined with tight, closeups for the emotional impacts of the scenes. At one point, again from a technical standpoint, a rain storm hits when they get lost. We had to generate rain so we had to bring in rain towers and approach that one pretty carefully because once they get wet, they\u2019re wet. We were not in a position to be able to send them back to the trailers to get changed and dried off again, should something go wrong, so we had to be pretty careful with our approach to that but Alex and Martin are so great and such a pleasure to work with, they made it easy and fun. DEADLINE: I assume the rain scene was shot in one take? MIKITA : That\u2019s right. We had to get the rain essentially in one take so we did all our rehearsals very, very carefully and camera placements. Once the rain came down, I don\u2019t think Alex was expecting it to come down as fast and hard as it did so she started to laugh but used that in context of the scene, the absurdity of the situation of being washed up in the forest \u2014 What more could happen?! And then the rain starts. Once she started laughing, she used that because she knew, oh I need to stay in character, that was pretty fun. DEADLINE: So the laugh was not scripted? MIKITA : It wasn\u2019t no, no, it was just her take on it. We kind of knew that it was coming; the anticipation of having these big rain towers overhead, everybody with their finger on the button. So she was anticipating it but it\u2019s never what you expected. DEADLINE: A kiss in the rain is a hallmark of a romantic movie. You had not one but two in the Angel\u2019s Peak montage, between an established couple, Mel and Jack, and a brand new one, Brie and Mike. How did that juxtaposition come about? MIKITA : That I have to give full credit to [writer] Ildiko [Susany], she had created the sequence in the structure of the script such that we could have those concurrent moments. With Brie and Mike, they are having a baseball game, which was a lot of fun in itself because neither of them \u2014 well, Marco plays a little bit of baseball but the extras that showed up couldn\u2019t really play baseball. So we ended up having to get some of our key crew members in on it. DEADLINE: So some of those players on the field are actually crew members? MIKITA : Yeah, there\u2019s a few of them. Our production manager, Neil [Williams], was in there, I threw him into the game. And there\u2019s a couple of other crew members as well; I had to bring them in to make it look a little bit more realistic. And it worked out fine because it was created as a montage, so it wasn\u2019t like they had to sustain long shots. But thank goodness for the crew members that stepped up and helped out with that sequence. That\u2019s so indicative of everybody on Virgin River . It\u2019s such a great family, the crew and the cast, everybody really enjoys coming to work. DEADLINE: To wrap up Mel and Jack\u2019s hike, can you share your experience filming Jack\u2019s emotional \u201cI was lost, I was broken\u201d speech on Angel\u2019s Peak? MIKITA : Well, the two of them are so great together and they work so well together and support one another, both as friends off-camera and supporting one another on camera. It was obviously a big moment for Jack and for Martin as the actor to be able to articulate it in a not too melodramatic way. Martin is very self-aware, and he\u2019s always very, very concerned that he\u2019s not being disingenuous and has been truthful. The way that he had that on the day was just to stay really relaxed and having fun, drinking tea. His partner was there visiting from New Zealand at the time as well which really kept him at ease because she\u2019s such a wonderful person. There is a lot of friendships and camaraderie on this set anyway, and it was very loose and fun. The weather was great. And we were just trying to keep everything really relaxed and didn\u2019t draw too much attention to the scenes themselves ahead of time. We didn\u2019t even really rehearse much \u2014 we ran the lines maybe once \u2014 we wanted it to be spontaneous and real and genuine. Martin was so great, and I think he felt good about it after we had done it because even for a lot of us on-set \u2014 myself and other crew members \u2014 were very affected by his speech because everybody has baggage in their lives and to hear somebody speak from the heart is always something special. DEADLINE: Moving towards Episode 10, there is a change of genres, with a crime caper element involving Jack\u2019s glamping site discovery, Brady\u2019s abduction and the Jack-led rescue operation. It feels like almost a different show within the show. Barbara Pollard as Melissa Montgomery in episode 510. Netflix MIKITA : Yeah, I agree with you completely on that. I feel the same way. It was a real turn of events, the cliffhanger at the end of nine where Jack makes the discovery, catching Brady red-handed. I thought it was a great, very well crafted, well written, ending and cliffhanger for 509 and then to just continue that momentum and build that momentum. It\u2019s like you said it\u2019s like a different genre that now all of a sudden we\u2019re in a heavy crime drama with an action sequence and fighting and gunfire, all sorts of stuff happening, and it\u2019s very unusual for Virgin River . And again, hats off to Martin, to Ben and to everybody that was part of that for being able to slip so effortlessly into what is essentially a whole different format for the show, and it showed us that these guys are good action actors as well. We had some careful fight choreography that we had done ahead of time. To stage the fight sequence in a short amount of time on location, there\u2019s always challenges in doing that, but it all came together really, really well. Obviously, that\u2019s a big moment with Mike being shot and that was the uncertainty of what could potentially happen there and with the guilt that Brady would be feeling as a result of all of this, and the discovery of the drugs, the displacement of the people and all the rest, that was a really brave transition for the writers to take the story there. But at the same time, in the midst of that, we easily move ourselves into a Labor Day carnival, which at first blush when I read it, I felt that might be a bit too abrupt of a transition to go from such a heavy drama, action sequence to a carnival situation, but I thought it would work well. DEADLINE: Well, it\u2019s another hallmark of the show. We\u2019ve had Renaissance Fair, Lumberjack Games, Moonlight Mingle. Every season, there is a big community event. MIKITA : A big community set piece, yeah. And the real challenge with the carnival was, we experienced what\u2019s called an atmospheric river event during the shooting of that carnival. First of all, we were bound by only having access to that carnival rides and everything for a three-day window because it was booked for some other events somewhere so we had to shoot it on those particular three days. We had heavy, heavy, heavy rain throughout the time that we were shooting the carnival, so we had to bring in big construction cranes and build what are called fly swatters, which are basically just big tarps that they could put over top to try to alleviate as much of the rain showing on camera as possible. But it was really difficult to do. Same thing again, back to the crew coming to the rescue. There were several rides, where the extras didn\u2019t want to be going on these rides in the epic rain for extensive periods of time so the crew jumped in and volunteered to be carnival-goers. So, in spite of the horrible weather, we still were able to laugh and have fun and make the best of the situation. DEADLINE: So all the carnival scenes were filmed in rain conditions? I couldn\u2019t tell. MIKITA : Yeah, there were only one or two scenes that were not in full rain, but I\u2019d say 80% of it was in heavy, heavy rain. DEADLINE: Did you consider changing the script to incorporate the rain or was it, we already had plenty of rain in \u2018Angel\u2019s Peak\u2019, no more this season? MIKITA : Yeah, it didn\u2019t track and it didn\u2019t really make sense. I was at the time advocating for it \u2014 we\u2019re in Northern California it does rain, and it exemplifies the resilience of the people of Virgin River that in spite of weather, they\u2019re happy to go out and participate in community events. There was a scene that we did have to change around a little bit; it was one of the first scenes where Lizzie\u2019s doing all the preparation [for the carnival]. I was pretty adamant that they wear appropriate costuming \u2014 wear a raincoat or carry an umbrella because it is really raining, there is no hiding it. After that scene, we had all together decided, let\u2019s make best efforts to try to hide the rain as best we can. And that\u2019s what we did. DEADLINE: There were a few revelations during the carnival, including Charmaine\u2019s encounter with her twins\u2019 father. You also directed the finale last season when the cliffhanger was her telling Jack that he was not the father. When you were filming that, did you know who the father was and did you have any inkling it would be Calvin? MIKITA : I did not. I think I was just as surprised as anybody when that was revealed. I was kind of floored actually because I had no idea at the end of Season 4 that he would be the father, I did not see that coming. We all talk about it, all the crew, we\u2019re always quite anxious to read the scripts when they come out because we\u2019re just like the audience; we\u2019re wondering and curious ourselves as to how are we going to get out of this mess, who is it going to be? DEADLINE: Also immediately after the carnival, Mel takes Jack to the tree with the swing at Lilly\u2019s burned-down farm and they reminiscent about their conversation in the same spot during Season 1, before deciding to buy the land. Did you happen to direct that episode that was used for the flashbacks? MIKITA : Yes, I did direct that. We didn\u2019t go to exactly the same spot, we recreated the aftermath at a different location. For all sorts of logistical reasons, we didn\u2019t go there and because we were going to be there at nighttime and all the burnt aftermath, it wasn\u2019t essential to go back to the same spot even though I wanted to go back to that spot. But, for many production reasons, it didn\u2019t make sense. DEADLINE: What was your reaction when you saw in the script a reference to something that we had pretty much forgotten about coming full circle and footage previously shot being used again? MIKITA : I wondered at first if it made sense for us to use the flashbacks. I didn\u2019t know whether that was necessary from a story perspective at the time when I read it. But I think it made sense to refresh the audience and to make that connection because I think it would have been out of people\u2019s minds. I don\u2019t think they would have recognized or remembered the tree swing. DEADLINE: I didn\u2019t. And speaking of flashbacks, one was used when Preacher hears that a body has been found. Was this also a decision to refresh viewers\u2019 memories and to make it clear we are talking about the same body that Preacher buried? That death was a more recent development than the swing scene, and the flashback felt more on the nose. MIKITA : I thought that also at first, is it a bit too much, a bit too on the nose but I think it was just important to do that. I don\u2019t think that the footage that was used was necessarily from the show, it was footage that was shot but had not aired previously, I believe. (L to R) Teryl Rothery as Muriel St. Claire, Mark Ghanime as Dr. Cameron Hayek in episode 509. Netflix DEADLINE: The last act of the finale provided updates on all of Virgin River \u2018s couples, Mel and Jack, Lizzie and Denny, Doc and Hope, Preacher and Kaia, Brie and Mike and Cameron and Muriel. What was the most surprising couple development for you? It was kind of brave for the writers to pursue a Muriel-Cameron relationship with an age gap rarely seen on television. It is way more common when the gap is in the other direction, with an older man. MIKITA : Well, that was the most surprising for me, because I honestly didn\u2019t see that one coming. Muriel\u2019s character is so outgoing and fun and brave to begin with that, when it did start to surface it was like, oh, yeah, I could see her doing that, I could see her being in a way the instigator in the relationship. First of all as you say, it\u2019s brave on behalf of the writers because of that obvious age gap. But at the same time it makes sense and it\u2019s perfectly acceptable. I felt good about it and enjoyed it and enjoyed the way they played it and how they presented themselves as a couple. For Cameron, he has to be so cautious and a little bit more self aware and self-conscious. At the same time, he says okay, we\u2019re going to the carnival. It\u2019s so much fun to see how everybody else reacts. So that was the fun one for me and perhaps the Brie and Mike development. I didn\u2019t really see that one coming so much. For Brie and Brady, we always knew that was never really going to be something that was going to get onto solid ground. So I think that we saw coming. But Mike I thought that was an interesting one, too. DEADLINE: The Lizzie and Denny scene, in which he tells her that he wants to leave Virgin River but she surprises him with the pregnancy news. How was it filming Denny\u2019s (Kai Bradbury)\u2019s reaction of utter shock? Sarah Dugdale as Lizzie in episode 510. Netflix MIKITA : That was all Kai. He\u2019s a terrific actor, I think he is underrated. I\u2019ve worked with him on another show and saw the depth of his abilities as a performer. There were a lot of distractions for him during that scene \u2014 we had the weather distraction of the rain. The amount of noise generated by the machinery of all the rides that were happening, the extras around them, everything, all the noise from the carnival was difficult, and we had to re-voice a lot of the scenes. That was one of them where he had to do some ADR for that, both of them had to, and Doc and Hope had to re-voice theirs. Hats off to Kai for being able to be in the moment and not be distracted by everything that was going on around him. It\u2019s a testament to his ability as an actor and generally for all of our actors on Virgin River that they can work through all these other distractions and stay focused on their job as actors and stay in character. DEADLINE: And now onto the flash-forward at the end of the finale that teases the two holiday episodes. What was your reaction when you read that scene and the final line about Mel\u2019s real father? MIKITA : I was a bit floored by that. And it became a running joke on set, we were all speculating, everybody is wondering what the answer is. I was literally going through my database of okay, who could it possibly be? I didn\u2019t see it coming. None of us did. But we all wanted to have the answer so we could understand it to give it context when we were shooting the scenes.",

        "content": "A powerful magnitude Friday night, the largest tremor to hit the country in at least 120 years. Officials report and expect the death toll to rise as rescuers reach remote afflicted areas. Such strong earthquakes are rare in North Africa, which means few structures are designed to withstand them and residents have little experience responding when a quake occurs. But earthquakes can still be deadly in earthquake-prone regions. In February, a huge magnitude early Monday morning. Another quake with a magnitude of 7.7 rocked the region a few hours later. The quakes and toppled more than . Two major fault lines cross the Turkey and trigger shocks on a regular basis. Larger quakes are less frequent, but still a regular occurrence. Last November, Turkey suffered a . A between Turkey and Greece in 2020. While scientists have drastically improved their understanding of where earthquakes are likely to occur, forecasting when one will occur is still impractical. The rumbling earth can easily catch people off-guard, worsening the ensuing death and destruction. In light of the recent disasters, here\u2019s a refresher on earthquakes, along with some of the latest science on measuring and predicting them. 1) What causes earthquakes An earthquake occurs when massive blocks of the earth\u2019s crust . These blocks, called tectonic plates, lie on top of the earth\u2019s mantle, a layer that over millions of years. That means tectonic plates jostle each other over time. They can also slide on top of each other, a phenomenon called subduction. The places on the planet where one plate meets another are the most prone to earthquakes. The specific surfaces where parcels of earth slip past each other are called faults. As plates move, pressure builds up across their boundaries, while friction holds them in place. When the former overwhelms the latter, the earth shakes as the pent-up energy dissipates. Scientists understand these kinds of earthquakes well, which include those stemming from the San Andreas Fault in California and the East Anatolian Fault in Turkey. However, earthquakes can also occur within tectonic plates, as pressure along their edges cause deformations in the middle. These risks are harder to detect and measure. \u201cOur understanding of these within-plate earthquakes is not as good,\u201d said Stanford University geophysics professor Greg Beroza. An earthquake within a tectonic plate has fewer telltale signs than those that occur at fault lines, he added. 2) The Richter scale isn\u2019t the only measurement game in town anymore The Richter scale, developed by Charles Richter in 1935 to measure quakes in Southern California, has fallen out of fashion. It uses a logarithmic scale, rather than a linear scale, to account for the fact that there is such a huge difference between the tiniest tremors and tower-toppling temblors. On a logarithmic scale, a magnitude 7 earthquake is 10 times more intense than a magnitude 6 and 100 times more intense than a magnitude 5. The Richter scale is actually measuring the peak amplitude of seismic waves, making it an indirect estimate of the earthquake itself. So if an earthquake is like a rock dropped in a pond, the Richter scale is measuring the height of the largest wave, not the size of the rock nor the extent of the ripples. And in the case of an earthquake, the ripples aren\u2019t traveling through a homogenous medium like water, but through solid rock that comes in different shapes, sizes, densities, and arrangements. Solid rock also supports multiple kinds of waves. (Some geologic structures can dampen big earthquakes while others can amplify lesser tremors.) While Richter\u2019s scale, calibrated to Southern California, was useful to compare earthquakes at the time, it provides an incomplete picture of risks and loses accuracy for stronger events. It also misses some of the nuances of other earthquake-prone regions in the world, and it isn\u2019t all that useful for people trying to build structures to withstand them. \u201cWe can\u2019t use that in our design calculations,\u201d said Steven McCabe, leader of the earthquake engineering group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. \u201cWe deal in displacements.\u201d Displacement, or how much the ground actually moves, is one alternative way to describe earthquakes. Another is the moment magnitude scale. It accounts for multiple types of seismic waves, drawing on more precise instruments and better computing to provide a reliable measuring stick to compare seismic events. When you hear about an earthquake\u2019s magnitude in the news \u2014 like Turkey\u2019s recent magnitude 7.8 quake \u2014 moment magnitude is usually the scale being used. But this is still a proxy for the size of the earthquake. And with only indirect measurements, it can take up to a year to decipher the scale of an event, like the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, said Marine Denolle, an earthquake researcher at Harvard University. \u201cWe prefer to use peak ground acceleration,\u201d she said. This is a metric that measures how the speed and direction of the ground changes and has proven the most useful for engineers. So, yes, earthquake scales have gotten a lot more complicated and specific over time. But that\u2019s also helped scientists and engineers take much more precise measurements \u2014 which makes a big difference in planning for them. 3) We can\u2019t really anticipate them all that well Predicting earthquakes is a touchy issue for scientists, in part because it has long been a game of who claim to be able to forecast earthquakes. (Their declarations have, of course, .) Scientists do have a good sense of earthquakes could happen. Using historical records and geologic measurements, they can highlight potential seismic hot spots and the kinds of tremors they face. (You can check out the of fault lines and of seismic events.) As for quakes will hit, that\u2019s still murky. \u201cLots of seismologists have worked on that problem for many decades. We\u2019re not predicting earthquakes in the short term,\u201d said Beroza. \u201cThat requires us to know all kinds of information we don\u2019t have.\u201d It\u2019s difficult to figure out when an earthquake will occur, since the forces that cause them happen slowly over a vast area but are dispersed rapidly over a narrow region. What\u2019s amazing is that forces built up across continents over millions of years can hammer cities in minutes. Forecasting earthquakes would require high-resolution measurements deep underground over the course of decades, if not longer, coupled with sophisticated simulations. And even then, it\u2019s unlikely to yield an hour\u2019s worth of lead time. So there are ultimately too many variables at play and too few tools to analyze them in a meaningful way. Some research shows that foreshocks can precede a larger earthquake, but it\u2019s difficult to distinguish them from the hundreds of smaller earthquakes that occur on a regular basis. On shorter time scales, can actually race ahead of seismic waves. In the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan, for example, warnings from near the epicenter reached Tokyo 232 miles away, buying residents about a minute of warning time. Many countries are now setting up to harness modern electronic communications to detect tremors and transmit alerts ahead of shaking ground, buying a few precious minutes to seek shelter. Meanwhile, after a large earthquake, aftershocks often rock the afflicted region. \u201cIf we just had a big one, we know there will be smaller ones soon,\u201d Denolle said. When it comes to prediction, researchers understandably want to make sure they don\u2019t overpromise and underdeliver, especially when thousands of lives and billions of dollars in damages are at stake. But even this caution has had consequences. In 2012, six Italian scientists were for accurately saying the risks of a large earthquake in the town of L\u2019Aquila were low after a small cluster of earthquakes struck the region in 2009. to assess the risk, a large quake struck and killed 309 people. Those convictions were and the ordeal has become a for how scientists convey uncertainty and risk to the public. 4) Sorry, your pets can\u2019t predict earthquakes either Reports of animals acting strange ahead of earthquakes date back to ancient Greece. But a useful pattern remains elusive. Feathered and furry forecasters emerge every time there\u2019s an earthquake and there\u2019s a cute animal to photograph, but this phenomenon is . Animals do weird things (by our standards) all the time and we don\u2019t attach any significance to them until an earthquake happens. \u201cOn any given day, there will be hundreds of pets doing things they\u2019ve never done before and have never done afterward,\u201d Beroza said. Bottom line: Don\u2019t wait for weird animal behavior to signal that an earthquake is coming. 5) Some earthquakes are definitely man-made The gargantuan expansion of hydraulic fracturing across the United States has left an in its wake. It\u2019s not the actual fracturing of shale rock that leads to tremors, but the injection of millions of gallons of wastewater underground. Scientists say the injected water makes it easier for rocks to slide past each other. \u201cWhen you inject fluid, you lubricate faults,\u201d Denolle said. The US Geological Survey calls these \u201cinduced earthquakes\u201d and reported that in Oklahoma, the number of earthquakes surged to 2,500 in 2014, 4,000 in 2015, and 2,500 in 2016. \u201cThe decline in 2016 may be due in part to injection restrictions implemented by the state officials,\u201d the USGS . \u201cOf the earthquakes last year, 21 were greater than magnitude 4.0 and three were greater than magnitude 5.0.\u201d This is up from an average of two earthquakes per year of magnitude 2.7 or greater between 1980 and 2000. (\u201cNatural\u201d earthquakes, on the other hand, are not becoming more frequent, according to Beroza.) Humans are causing earthquakes another way, too: Rapidly drawing water from underground reservoirs has also been shown to cause quakes in cities like Jakarta, Denolle said. 6) Climate change could have a tiny effect on earthquakes In general, scientists haven\u2019t measured any effect on earthquakes from climate change. But they\u2019re not ruling out the possibility. As average temperatures rise, massive ice sheets are melting, shifting billions of tons of water from exposed land into the ocean and allowing land masses to rebound. That global rebalancing could have , but signals haven\u2019t emerged yet. \u201cWhat might occur is enough ice melts that could unload the crust,\u201d Beroza said, but added there is no evidence for this, nor for which parts of the world will reveal a signal. Denolle agreed that this could be a mechanism, but if there is any impact from climate change on earthquakes, she says she suspects it will be very small. 7) We\u2019ve gotten better reducing earthquake risks and saving lives About occur in the Ring of Fire, the region around the Pacific Ocean running through places like the Philippines, Japan, Alaska, California, Mexico, and Chile. The ring is also home to three-quarters of all active volcanoes. Mexico is an especially interesting case study. The country sits on top of three tectonic plates, making it seismically active. In 1985, an earthquake struck the capital, . Denolle noted that the geology of the region makes it so that tremors from nearby areas are channeled toward Mexico City, making any seismic activity a threat. The Mexican capital is built on the site of the ancient Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, an island in the middle of a lake. The dry lakebed that is now the foundation of the modern metropolis amplifies shaking from earthquakes. The 1985 earthquake originated closer to the surface, and the seismic waves it produced had a relatively long time between peaks and valleys. This low-frequency vibration sends skyscrapers swaying, according to Denolle. \u201cThe recent earthquakes were deeper, so they had a higher frequency,\u201d she said. The biggest factor in preventing deaths from earthquakes is building codes. Designing buildings to move with the earth while remaining standing can save thousands of lives, but putting them into practice can be expensive and frequently becomes a political issue. \u201cUltimately, that information has got to get implemented, and you can pretty much get that implemented in new construction,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cThe trickier problem is existing buildings and older stock.\u201d Earthquake-prone countries know this well: Japan has been regularly to withstand earthquakes. The revised standards have in part fueled Japan\u2019s construction boom despite its declining population. Mexico has also raised standards for new construction. Laws enacted after the 1985 earthquake required builders to account for the soft lakebed soil in the capital and tolerate some degree of movement. Meanwhile, Iran has gone through several versions of its national building standards for earthquake resilience. And Alaska has been developing earthquake damage and for years. But , and the new rules only apply to new buildings. A school that collapsed in a 2017 Mexico City earthquake apparently was an older building that was not earthquake-resistant. And because the more recent earthquakes in Mexico shook the ground in a different way, even some of the buildings that survived the 1985 earthquake in 2017. In countries like Iran, there is a wide gulf between how buildings are constructed in cities versus the countryside. More than a quarter of the country\u2019s population , where homes are built using traditional materials like mud bricks and stone rather than reinforced concrete and steel. This is a big part of why casualties are so high when earthquakes strike remote parts of the country. The biggest risks fall to countries that don\u2019t have a major earthquake in living memory and therefore haven\u2019t prepared for them, or don\u2019t have the resources to do so. A led to many of the more than in Haiti stemming from the 2010 magnitude 7.0 earthquake. 8) The big one really is coming to the United States (someday) The you keep hearing about is real. The New Yorker won a Pulitzer Prize in 2015 for its reporting on the potential for massive earthquake that would rock the Pacific Northwest \u2014 \u201cthe worst natural disaster in the history of North America,\u201d which would impact 7 million people and span a region covering 140,000 square miles. The potential quake could reach a magnitude between 8.7 and 9.2, bigger than the largest expected earthquake from the San Andreas Fault, which scientist expect to top out at magnitude 8.2. Large earthquakes are also in store for Japan, New Zealand, and other parts of the Ring of Fire. We don\u2019t know when these earthquakes will rock us; we just have a rough estimate of the average time between them, which changes from region to region. \u201cIn the business, we\u2019ve been talking about that [Pacific Northwest] scenario for decades,\u201d Beroza said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re overdue, but it could happen at any time.\u201d \u201cIt is a threat,\u201d echoed Denolle. \u201cWe forget about this threat because we have not had an earthquake there for a while.\u201d \u201cA while\u201d means more than 300 years. So while California has long been steeling itself for big earthquakes with building codes and disaster planning, the Pacific Northwest may be caught off guard, though the author of the New Yorker piece, Kathryn Schulz, helpfully provided a .",

        "description": "Prepare your home to handle any natural disaster or emergency with these crucial essentials.",
        "content": "Preparing for an emergency is the last thing you want to be doing during an emergency. There's never enough food, flashlights, batteries, or fuel to go around once you hear of an impending hurricane, blizzard, or wildfire, because everyone else in town is going to out fighitng over the same limited stock of items. It's better to stock up in advance and avoid the battle royal. Forget the milk and eggs. We've rounded up all the essentials for your emergency kit. Be sure to check out more guides to keep your home stocked and yourself prepared, such as How to Build a Home Tool Kit , Essentials You Need to Keep In Your Car , Best Multi-Tools , and How to Winterize Your Home . Updated September 2023: We've swapped headlamps, AM/FM radios and small stoves, as well as adding an insulated water bottle, a hammer, and a summer sleeping bag. We've also updated pricing and availability. Special offer for Gear readers: Get a 1-year subscription to WIRED for $5 ($25 off) . This includes unlimited access to WIRED. com.

The Fenix E20 V2 for $45 is my top pick for an affordable emergency flashlight, but the ThruNite Archer 2A V3 for $30 is another solid choice. At 350 and 500 lumens, respectively, they're bright enough while remaining compact, and they last long on lower-light settings\u2014200 hours at 5 lumens for the Fenix and 51 hours at 17 lumens for the ThruNite. Both use two AA batteries, and in an emergency your main concern is to have a good supply of replacement batteries. If you're using alkaline batteries, remove them from the flashlight if it's going to sit unused for a long time, otherwise they'll leak and cause problems. Store them near the flashlight so you can easily find them. Try taping the batteries to the flashlight barrel. Pro tip: The best-performing flashlights are built specifically to use lithium-ion batteries or have nonremovable rechargeable batteries, which won't do you any good if the power is out for a long time. Rechargeable nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) AA batteries maintain their performance better over the lifetime of the battery, whereas alkalines\u2019 performance drops off more as they deplete, so buy some Panasonic Eneloops for $43 . They're better for the environment, but if they run out of charge you can still use regular alkaline AAs. You may prefer to keep a headlamp handy. The Black Diamond Astro 300 for $20 runs on three easily found AAA batteries and has three brightness settings, the brightest of which throws 300 lumens. That's more than powerful enough for tasks outside the home, while you can squeeze 140 hours of runtime out of the lowest setting for general tasks indoors. Coleman 4D LED Camp Lantern Coleman discontinued our previous favorite pick, the Divide+ Push Lantern, so the Coleman 4D LED Camp Lantern for $22 is the next-best choice for not a lot of coin. Flashlights do a poor job when you need to light up a whole room or if you need your hands free for a task. This basic lantern offers a single setting of 54 lumens, with a runtime of 175 hours on four D-cell batteries. That sounds like a lot, but next to other full-size battery-powered lanterns, such as the Coleman Twin LED lantern that uses eight D cells, it's economical. Fifty-four lumens is not what I'd call bright, but it is plenty bright enough for most tasks, even reading, while conserving battery life. If you want to save batteries or just prefer hanging out by gentle flickering candlelight, keep a spare emergency candle or two. The Coghlan's 36-Hour Survival Candle for $15 has three wicks that'll last for 12 hours each. Keep a lighter or some matches nearby. Lifestraw Go Water Bottle Most of the time, your water supply will work even when the power goes out. But major natural disasters can knock it out or damage it, and you might get dirty water. The LifeStraw Go Series Water Purifier Bottle for $45 marries the straw component of the LifeStraw Personal Water Filter with a BPA-free plastic bottle to filter out 99.99 percent of waterborne bacteria for up to 26 gallons of water. The original, bottle-less straw is still a good backup option for $17, and it'll filter up to 1,000 gallons. Another option is the Katadyn Steripen Adventurer for $120 , which purifies using ultraviolet light. Dunk it in your water and stir. It won\u2019t filter out sediment, but it\u2019s small, lightweight, and runs on replaceable CR123 batteries. You can also try Katadyn Micropur tablets for $16 . They're cheap and easy to store. Drop them in water and wait briefly. The taste isn\u2019t great, but no water-treatment tablets or droplets are, in my experience. If you have a large household, you may prefer something like the MSR AutoFlow XL Gravity Filter for $125 . Gravity filters take longer to purify water. You can boil water, but it won\u2019t filter out sediment, and boiling uses fuel and takes time. Coway Airmega 200M Wildfires are becoming an annual hazard, especially on the West Coast of the US, and they can spread dangerous amounts of particulate throughout the air. Homes aren't very airtight at all. Keep that toxic, carcinogenic junk out of your indoor air (and out of your lungs) by purchasing an air purifier for your home. The Coway Airmega 200M for $197 is my favorite affordable model for a small room, such as a bedroom or home office. For a larger room (up to 930 square feet), the Coway Airmega 250 for $400 is our top pick. Like the 200M, it has a smart setting that ramps up the filtering power automatically when needed; after several years of testing, both models are still going strong. Check out our Best Air Purifiers guide for more recommendations from the WIRED Gear Team. You probably already have some face masks at home, but if you don't and you live in a region susceptible to wildfires, you should pick up a box of disposable, medical-grade masks so you can breathe easier if the air becomes saturated with smoke. Fortunately, the best masks that protect against Covid-19 also protect well against smoke. We recommend the Powecom KN95 10-Pack for $12 . If these are out of stock, as many masks frequently are, check out our Best Disposable Face Masks guide. Coleman Gas Camping Stove Safety note: Don't use any of these stoves indoors. All of these fuels give off potentially deadly fumes that can accumulate and kill. Still made in the US, the classic Coleman Propane Camp Stove for $48 really hasn't changed much over the years. Propane is easy to use if you remember to stock up, and it's clean-burning. If propane is not your thing, get the Coleman Guide-Series Dual Fuel Camp Stove $198 . Camp fuel (also known as Coleman fuel and white gas) burns relatively cleanly, is easy to find for sale, and is an ideal camp stove fuel. You can also use gasoline in the Dual Fuel, but gasoline contains a lot of additives that gunk up the stove's internals, and you'll need to clean the stove out much more frequently. Get a Coleman Filtering Funnel for $11 if you purchase a liquid-fuel stove. The Sterno Outdoor Folding Camp Stove for $14 folds up so small that it's an easy option for people without room to keep a full-size stove around. It's an inexpensive backup that's handy to have, even if you've got a nice camp stove or a backpacking stove like an MSR Pocket Rocket for $85 . Our previous pick, the Jetboil Zip for $95 , is a fine stove for making single-serve hot drinks and soupy meals, but with the MSR you can use your regular cookware to make multiperson meals. It's not as fancy as the Colemans, but it's a lot easier to store in a crowded apartment. Make sure you grab an MSR IsoPro Fuel Canister for $11 . This large, 16-ounce size is best, in case the emergency lasts for several days. GSI Outdoors Pioneer Table Set Your regular cooking utensils, eating utensils, and metal, plastic, and wooden cookware can all be used during an emergency, but glass or ceramic drinking glasses and plates are a different case, as they can shatter. It'll be tough cleaning up the pieces with no power. When the lights go out, switch to this enameled steel dishware, such as the GSI Outdoors Pioneer Table Set for $130 . If somebody drops a piece, no big deal. Assuming your home's water supply is still working (and clean), the water will come out of the pipes somewhat cooler than the ambient air temperature. Having an insulated bottle will help conserve that precious coolness if you don't like drinking room-temperature water. The Klean Kanteen Insulated Classic for $34 is much easier to find for sale than the Miir\u2014the top pick in our Best Reusable Water Bottles guide\u2014and I found it remarkably durable. For more drinkware, check out our Best Insulated Travel Mugs guide. Stock up on items that don't require refrigeration and have long shelf lives. Rather than making a grocery run for eggs and milk, pick up foods such as instant rice, dried fruit, and oatmeal. If you don't have room for a camp stove or live in a busy city where it may be tough to cook outside when the power goes out, or if you just don't like to cook, pick up a Mountain House 3-Day Adventure Dehydrated Meal Kit for $105 . All you need to do is add water. If the power does go out, keep your refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible, to keep the stuff inside fresh for as long as possible. Leatherman Wave Plus For small jobs, a good do-it-all multi-tool such as the Leatherman Wave Plus for $120 is a lifesaver. When the lights are out and there's emergency gear spread out all over the home, it's especially annoying to keep going out to the garage to retrieve one tool after another. Carry them all in one tool in your pocket and cut the number of trips way down. If you only need a knife, the made-in-France Opinel No. 8 folding knife for $19 is an excellent choice. For such little money, the stainless steel blade\u2014which can be locked open or closed\u2014is remarkably sharp and well-shaped. Because it's so light, I often take it hiking instead of a chunkier knife. You may have to board up windows. Nails have increased sheer strength (that is, strength against forces perpendicular to the head). You'll need a good hammer. Since the slightly more affordable Plumb we recommend in my How to Build a Home Tool Kit guide is sold out, you may as well step up to my favorite hammer, the Vaughan 20-ounce Smooth Face Hickory-Handle Hammer, for $27 . Forget metal-handled hammers. They transit a lot of striking force to your hand through the handle. Fiberglass or wood is more forgiving. Pick up a pound or two of common nails while you're at it. You may need to repair items around the home, too, so it wouldn't hurt to have a good drill handy. The DeWalt 20V Max 1/2-Inch Cordless Drill for $99 is my favorite drill, and the best deal in cordless drills on the market. I recommend it for all homeowners, but it comes especially in handy when you have a lot of screws to drive in a hurry. A DeWalt 14-piece Screw Bit Set for $11 is a solid, affordable set of drill bits to use with your drill. It's difficult for most people to store a bunch of spare lumber in case of an emergency\u2014you'll just have to go to the hardware store to stock up at the earliest sign of trouble\u2014but it's easy to go ahead and store a big box of general purpose screws. Some 2-inch wood screws should do the trick. Make sure they're wood screws, which are designed specifically to go into wood. Some odds and ends will come in handy, too. Always keep a roll of duct tape for $8 handy, and a screwdriver in case your cordless drill runs out of power and you're unable to recharge it. A Channellock 6-in-1 Screwdriver for $8 has the main screwdriver bit sizes, both flathead and Phillips, and keeps everything compact by storing the bits inside itself. Mosey on over to our article How to Put Together a Home Tool Kit and our guide to the Best Multi-Tools for most information on preparing your home for natural disasters. Coleman Quick Bed Single High Airbed Mattress You'll need more beds if other folks stay with you during an emergency. Generally, I hate how inflatable mattresses deflate under my body weight by the early morning hours. The only exceptions I've found are Coleman mattresses, which have air nozzles designed to seal tighter when bodyweight is on top of the mattress. When I used the Quick Bed Single High Mattress Queen-Size for $53 last, I slept three nights before having to top it off with more air. Pick up a manual air pump if you don't already have a bicycle or sports pump. There's also the Coleman Pack-Away Camping Cot for $76 . Unlike most cots, this one doesn't have horizontal bars across the head and foot ends. Bars like that are evil. I've whacked my head and ankles on them enough for two lifetimes. You can use a rectangular sleeping bag (instead of a mummy bag) so that you have more room to stretch out. The Coleman Brazos 30 Sleeping Bag for $47 and Alps Mountaineering Crescent Lake 20F Sleeping Bag for $55 are solid options that won't break the bank. For warmer seasons when you might need something during cool nights, the Marmot NanoWave 55 Sleeping Bag for $79 is a personal favorite. It's rated to 55 degrees Fahrenheight and is just roomy enough not to feel constricting while also packing down into the size of a water bottle. Keep in mind that temperature ratings on sleeping bags are often overly optimistic, especially for women, who tend to sleep colder than men. Anker Portable Charger Anker makes my favorite power banks, which I use when traveling and during power outages to keep my phone topped off. That's important during emergencies for communicating with people. You can get by for days with a slim model like the Anker PowerCore Slim 10,000-mAh Portable Charger for $24 , but if you know you'll be on your phone much more or using an iPad, steer toward the PowerCore 26,800-mAh for $26 . Remember to check it periodically, pre-emergency, to keep it fully charged. Read our Best Portable Chargers guide for more. If you'd like to plan for longer emergencies, in situations where you may run down a battery bank before the power comes back on, consider the Powerfilm Solar Lightsaver for $200 . Barely the size of a small flashlight when rolled up, this compact solar panel charges fully in only six hours. Once it's charged, connect it via a USB cable to whichever device needs extra juice. It can also double as a standard battery bank if you charge it via a wall outlet, which takes about three hours with the included micro USB cable. You'll also want a portable radio, such as the Sony Portable AM/FM Radio for $40 , to hear weather reports and emergency broadcasts. Even if you don't ordinarily listen to terrestrial radio, you should have one and not rely on your phone. As with your flashlight, take the batteries out and store them with the radio. Fjallraven jacket Make sure you\u2019ve got warm clothing to wear indoors if the power goes out. The Uniqlo Fluffy Yarn Fleece Jacket ( men , women ) for $40 and REI Co-Op 650 Down Jacket 2.0 ( men , women ) for $100 are insanely warm, as are Uniqlo\u2019s Heattech long john tops ( men , women ) for $30 and bottoms ( men , women ) for $30 . If you end up outside cutting up trees and fixing busted fences after a disaster, you might not want to get your regular jacket torn up or muddy. My Carharrt Duck Sherpa-Lined Coat for $130 is very warm and very tough; I\u2019ve subjected it to all kinds of abuse. There's a similarly tough Carharrt Duck Sherpa-Lined Coat in women's sizing for $130 . Fjallraven is another tough outerwear brand that makes jackets we like. While you\u2019re at it, check out our gift guide for people who're always cold . Don\u2019t forget a cozy blanket, such as the L.L.Bean Wicked Plush Throw for $30 , and keep your feet warm with Glerups' Wool Slippers for $100 and Darn Tough wool socks for $23 . They're expensive, but they\u2019ve kept my feet warm through a few disasters. Hario Skerton Pro. Mr. Coffee and Keurig don't work when the power's out, but you'll still want your morning cup of joe. I'm one of WIRED's many coffee-worshiping zealots, and my favorite coffee grinder is the manual Hario Skerton Pro for $51 . Its base is made of thick glass that's survived more than a few drops onto my hardwood floor, and you can adjust the grind size to be suitable for anything from espresso to French press. For pour-overs, the ceramic Hario V60 Size 02 for $21 is perfect for making a big cup for one person at a time. If you do pour-over, you'll need to keep coffee filters for $6 around, and you'll need a gooseneck kettle to control the pour. The best stovetop one I've used is the Hario V60 Jino Gooseneck Kettle for $44. For French press, the Frieling 23-Ounce for $120 is my pick. It's double-wall insulated, so you won't burn your hands, and it's big enough to make a couple of big cups of coffee at a time. The AeroPress for $40 also comes highly recommended by another WIRED coffee addict. Check out our Best Insulated Travel Mugs and Best Portable Coffee Makers guides for more. Luggable Loo Your shower is likely to work just fine, but the Simple Shower Gravity Shower Kit for $12 is an inexpensive, compact backup if your home loses its supply of clean tap water. This kit screws onto a common soda bottle. Hang it upside down and it'll feed water onto the bather. You can use it anywhere, but you may as well set it up in your regular shower. If you hang it off the showerhead pipe, just make sure the weight won't tear it out of the wall or bend it. This product tends to go in and out of stock, so if it's currently unavailable, just keep an eye on the product page. Toilets usually will still flush fine in an emergency, and if they stop refilling you can flush a toilet by pouring water into the back tank (not the bowl). If your home's water supply is broken for days, eventually you'll need somewhere else to go. Buy a Luggable Loo Toilet Seat Lid for $16 and a 5-Gallon Bucket for $5 to construct a makeshift toilet. Don't forget waste bags for $14 to line the bucket. Keep a bag of kitty litter nearby, along with a cheap trowel for $6 for scooping it into the bucket after each use, extra toilet paper, and hand sanitizer. Champion Dual Fuel 3650-Watt Most of the time, you can get by without a generator and manage to stay warm, cook, and keep some lights on. You have to maintain generators, make sure you store enough fuel, and empty their tanks before they sit unused for a long time\u2014or use a fuel stabilizer for $9 . If you need a generator for medical equipment or think the luxury is worth the hassle, Honda makes excellent ones; Briggs & Stratton motors are solid too. But honestly, if you have to buy a big, hulking generator that\u2019ll sit unused most of the time, and you\u2019re watching your pennies, you can get by with a cheap one such as the Champion Dual Fuel 3650-Watt for $575 . Pro tip: Change the spark plug to a brand-name one as soon as you bring it home. The stock spark plugs that come with these Chinese generators tend to be junk. Just remember that gasoline spoils relatively quickly, needs to be prepared for inactivity with fuel stabilizers, and must be drained after a year. This is why, for most people, a generator isn't worth it (especially if you follow the rest of this guide). You should keep some spare gas around, as well. Whether you need it for your generator or your car, buy a fuel can that's made specifically for storing fuel safely. The Garage Boss Press N Pour for $28 will hold 5 gallons of gasoline and comes with a safety nozzle that only releases fuel when the spout is pressed to the gas tank opening. Just remember that cans are typically color-coded to the types of fuel they hold, in order to reduce the chance of costly or dangerous mix-ups. Gasoline goes in red canisters, and diesel goes in yellow . You probably have most of the medical essentials such as bandages and ibuprofen, but you should have a more robust medical kit for emergencies. Check out my guide on How to Make a First Aid Kit . It'll tell you how to build a bomber kit for less money than the storebought versions. If that sounds like a daunting task, the Adventure Medical Kits Mountain Series Explorer Medical Kit for $70 will cover the bases.. They also make medical kits that include directions for pets and their humans for $57 . If someone gets hurt badly, you might not be able to get to a hospital right away. It's a good idea to learn some first aid. You can take NOLS Wilderness First Aid courses through REI. From my experiences over the past four years, NOLS has fantastic instructors and a thorough hands-on curriculum. Natural disasters can be pretty boring during the non-panicky parts. Power outages involve lots of sitting around, so pick up a card game or a board game to play. I recommend Exploding Kittens for $20 to soothe everybody's nerves\u2014or aggravate them in an entertaining manner. It also has no small pieces to lose in the dark. For board games, check out one of our favorites: Ticket to Ride for $48 . Check out more of WIRED's Favorite Board Games for ways to pass the time during trying times. Finally, you should read WIRED senior associate reviews editor Adrienne So's article on why the best emergency gear is other people . Having a network of people to communicate with and who will check in on you is incredibly important.",

        "content": "close Video MSNBC host asks what will change voters' mind on the issue of climate change when 'frequent death and destruction' is not doing it During a recent interview with a climate change expert, MSNBC host Chris Jansing wondered what more than \"frequent death and destruction\" caused by climate-related natural disasters will convince voters to take the issue seriously. A California scientist admitted that he \"left out the full truth\" about climate change, blaming it primarily on human causes, to get his study published in a prestigious science journal. Patrick T. Brown, a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University and doctor of earth and climate sciences, admitted in an online article in The Free Press , a blog post and a series of social media posts that h e distort ed th e findings of his studi es to app eal to th e e ditors at Nature and Science magazines, which are prestigious online science journals. \"And the editors of these journals have made it abundantly clear, both by what they publish and what they reject, that they want climate papers that support certain preapproved narratives\u2014even when those narratives come at the expense of broader knowledge for society,\" Brown wrote in The Free Press. WILDFIRES AREN'T GETTING WORSE BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE REAL CULPRIT WILL SURPRISE YOU Patrick T. Brown's study published in Nature magazine on Aug. 30 stated that climate change affected extreme wildfire behavior like the devastating fires in California and Maui. (AP Photo/Eric Thayer) Brown's study published in Nature on Aug. 30 stated that climate change affected extreme wildfire behavior like the devastating fires in California and Maui . The established scientist now admits that he \"focused narrowly\" only on the human influence of wildfires, instead of focusing broadly on the complexities of other \"obviously relevant factors.\" He blamed his angle on the pressure scientists face to get their studies published in prestigious articles and the need to create catchy abstracts that can be turned into headlines. Brown said in The Free Press he is not \"disowning\" his paper by criticizing how he chose to approach the piece, but admitting it is less \"useful than it could have been.\" \"You might be wondering at this point if I\u2019m disowning my own paper. I\u2019m not,\" Brown wrote. \"On the contrary, I think it advances our understanding of climate change\u2019s role in day-to-day wildfire behavior. It\u2019s just that the process of customizing the research for an eminent journal caused it to be less useful than it could have been.\" Brown wrote that the study didn\u2019t look at poor forest management and other factors that are just as important to fire behavior because he \"knew that it would detract from the clean narrative centered on the negative impact of climate change and thus decrease the odds that the paper would pass muster with Nature\u2019s editors and reviewers.\" He added such bias in climate science \"misinforms the public\" and \"makes practical solutions more difficult to achieve.\" \"Identifying and focusing on problems rather than studying the effectiveness of solutions makes for more compelling abstracts that can be turned into headlines, but it is a major reason why high-profile research is not as useful to society as it could be,\" Brown wrote in an X (formerly Twitter) thread on Sept. 5. Brown admitted his study didn\u2019t look at poor forest management and other factors important to fire behavior because he knew that would \"decrease the odds that the paper would pass muster with Nature\u2019s editors and reviewers.\" (AP Photo/Noah Berger) California Assembly leader James Gallagher, a Republican, blasted liberals by saying that they \"cherry-pick data\" to \"fit their agenda.\" \"Patrick Brown is saying the quiet part out loud - liberals are cherry-picking data to fit an agenda and push radical policies that drive up the cost of living,\" Gallagher told Fox News Digital. \"Climate change is Democrats\u2019 excuse to avoid blame for turning our forests into tinderboxes.\" BIDEN TRASHED FOR EMBELLISHING HOUSE FIRE WHILE TRYING TO RELATE TO NATURAL DISASTER VICTIMS: \u2018LYING AGAIN\u2019 \"If they don\u2019t get serious about forest management, we\u2019re going to see even more mega-fires destroying the landscape,\" Gallagher continued.

        "description": "For more than two weeks, the largest fire in decades in the Bull Run watershed has raged in the protected area that serves as Portland\u2019s primary drinking water source, triggering fears about water supply availability, water quality and the watershed\u2019s resilience to climate change.",
        "content": "For more than two weeks, the largest fire in decades in the Bull Run watershed has raged in the protected area that serves as Portland\u2019s primary drinking water source, triggering fears about water supply availability, water quality and the watershed\u2019s resilience to climate change. As of Friday, the lighting-sparked fire was estimated to be about . It has crept within a mile of one of the watershed\u2019s two drinking water reservoirs and about 2 miles from the Headworks treatment plant, which disinfects all Bull Run water. Water from the Bull Run \u2013 about 25 miles east of downtown Portland in Mount Hood National Forest \u2013 serves about 1 million Portland-area residents and provides water to 19 water districts through wholesale contracts, including the cities of Gresham, Sandy and Tualatin. Here\u2019s what you need to know. Though , the Camp Creek fire \u2013 named for the nearby Camp Creek Trail \u2013 is by far the largest in decades, said Edward Campbell, the Portland Water Bureau\u2019s deputy director. \u201cThis is definitely the closest fire we\u2019ve had to our facilities in at least a half-century,\u201d Campbell told The Oregonian/OregonLive.com. Water from the Bull Run River \u2013 which mostly comes from rainfall \u2013 is diverted by dams to two reservoirs in the forest, then treated and piped to Portland and other cities. The 2017 Eagle Creek Fire, which burned through nearly 49,000 acres of forest in the Columbia River Gorge, came close, . The Water Bureau is closely monitoring water in the reservoirs and says the water is safe to drink. But the fire could, under certain conditions, lead to the shutdown of the Bull Run system. If it gets too close to the Headworks plant, staff will have to evacuate, prompting a shutdown of the treatment plant and the Bull Run water source. As of this week, five to 15 staff members continue to work in the watershed, depending on the day, managing the treatment facility, conducting water quality testing, performing critical maintenance and monitoring and removing vegetation to help contain the fire, water officials said. Bull Run would also be shut down if the fire impairs water quality in the reservoirs. Heavy rains could wash ash, other burned materials and higher-than-average volumes of dirt into streams and reservoirs, leading to an increase in turbidity (the amount of particles suspended in the water). And because high turbidity decreases the effectiveness of water disinfection, it can make water unsafe to drink. To be clear, fires don\u2019t cause turbidity, Campbell said. The Water Bureau has shut down the Bull Run water source 11 times since 1985, most recently in November 2022 after a big storm. But fire can potentially increase turbidity, he said. Higher volumes of burned materials in the reservoirs can also increase the amount of phosphorus and other nutrients, leading to an increase in algae blooms. Ash and sediment can also react with chlorine, leading to health problems. The bureau has worked for years with the U.S. Forest Service, the Oregon Department of Forestry and local fire districts to prepare. The Forest Service, in conjunction with the other agencies, drafted the , which prioritizes protecting the drinking water source. The plan, reviewed annually, includes guidelines on fire prevention and fire response strategies, including minimizing erosion and sedimentation by avoiding fireline construction near streambanks and reducing pollution in the watershed by capturing spills from heavy equipment and routing road runoff away from streams. The bureau also uses a lightning detection service. Each time lightning strikes, staff can see where the strikes occurred and are able to check the area for fire starts. A fire retardant called was used on Aug. 25 and 26 inside the watershed, said Karen Dante-Wood, a spokesperson for the Great Basin Incident Management Team in charge of fighting the fire. The decision to use fire retardant \u2013 or any other firefighting strategy \u2013 is made by the federal firefighting agencies. Water Bureau officials told The Oregonian/OregonLive.com that\u2019s the only time retardant has ever been used in the watershed. Phos-Chek \u2013 composed of 85% water, 10% fertilizer and 5% other ingredients \u2013 is the most commonly used retardant in Oregon and Washington, Dante-Wood said, and is generally sprayed when high-value resources are at risk. Some , saying it can harm soil, plants, fish and other species and cause more plants to grow, adding fuel to future fires. But the Multnomah County Health Department has determined that the risk to human health from using fire retardant in the Bull Run watershed is negligible, Water Bureau spokesperson Felicia Heaton said. The Water Bureau hasn\u2019t detected the chemical associated with the fire retardant (namely, phosphorus, a key ingredient in fertilizer) in any of the samples it regularly takes in or near the reservoirs, Heaton said. Even if it were detected, the reservoir near the fire holds 7 billion gallons of water, meaning the dilution rate would be so high that the retardant would have little impact on water quality. No preventive forest management \u2013 including or tree thinning when no fires are active \u2013 has been done to date in the Bull Run watershed. That\u2019s in part because in the Bull Run. It\u2019s also because of the distinct ecology of the Bull Run forest \u2013 a temperate old growth rainforest where regrowth is so productive that forest management can actually increase fire risk by stimulating new growth, said Campbell, the Water Bureau deputy director. When the Bull Run system shuts down, the Water Bureau relies on its . That system has enough water to serve as the region\u2019s sole water source for 60 days, Campbell said. Typically, groundwater serves as a supplemental water source during dry summer seasons, for about a month on average. In late August, due to high temperatures, not the fire. But groundwater is also Portland\u2019s emergency backup supply. Since the groundwater system came online in 1985, the city has relied exclusively on groundwater 19 times due to Bull Run system disruptions. The longest emergency groundwater use happened in 2017 for 31 days due to the detection of . If the system had to be shut down for longer, Edwards said, Portland would ask its wholesale customers to rely on their other drinking water sources and the public to restrict water use. The possibility that the fire will destroy Headworks is slim, Campbell said. If fire directly threatens the plant, firefighters will wrap it in fireproof material. They\u2019ll also clear brush around it and set up sprinklers to keep it wet. The same approach was successfully used in the Eagle Creek fire , he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of optimism that we can protect our facility even if we do have to evacuate it,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe\u2019re not expecting any real devastating impacts at this point.\u201d The Water Bureau is evaluating the possibility of building a temporary treatment facility in the unlikely scenario that the Camp Creek fire damages the Headworks plant beyond repair, said Heaton, the Water Bureau spokesperson. Plans would be finalized only after the existing plant sustains damage, she said. In the meantime, the Water Bureau plans to break ground in September on a massive new Bull Run water filtration plant, to be located just outside the Bull Run watershed. When completed in 2027, the new facility will increase the system\u2019s resilience to wildfires, Campbell said, by reducing the impacts of water turbidity. (Per federal mandates, the new plant also will help filter out the parasite cryptosporidium, which occasionally shows up in Bull Run water.) Earlier this summer, Portland officials said the price tag for the new plant , a nearly four-fold increase from the $500 million plan first approved by Portland\u2019s elected leaders six years ago. The increase is due to ballooning construction costs and a tight labor market, city officials said. Construction costs will be paid by ratepayers through a series of annual water rate hikes and by a low-interest loan from the federal Environmental Protection Agency. The fire has strengthened the relationships and partnerships within the city and with local and federal firefighting agencies, Campbell said, reinforcing the need for continued coordination, planning and sharing of information. It also has highlighted the need to do more work on how climate change amplifies the frequency and intensity of natural disasters and how individual disasters can affect the Bull Run\u2019s water supply, he said. The Water Bureau already employs climate scientists who analyze water supply availability, but their focus has been on long-term projections rather than the impact of particular natural emergencies such as wildfires, Campbell said. The fire is also a good reminder that Portlanders should prepare in case of future water restrictions, which may become more common due to climate change. \u201cDisruptions to water service,\u201d Heaton said, \u201ccan happen at any time.\u201d \u2013 Gosia Wozniacka; ; @gosiawozniacka",

        "description": "Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily BeastChristianity and sex positivism are hardly synonyms. Christianity conjures up ideas about perpetual virgins, strict sexual codes, alarmingly large families, purity culture, threats of eternal judgment, and a general absence of fun. It might come as some surprise, therefore, to realize that the Divine Plan included more seductresses than shrinking wallflowers.Let\u2019s begin with Rahab\u2014the woman who helped bring down the city of Jericho. After being freed from enslavement in Egypt, and wandering for forty years in the wilderness, the Israelites found themselves in Canaan (aka the Holy Land). Canaan wasn\u2019t empty and thus began a period of violent and bloody conquest. According to the Hebrew Bible, Joshua (who had succeeded Moses as the people\u2019s leader) sent two spies to scout out the military resources of the well-defended city of Jericho.

        "content": "Christianity and sex positivism are hardly synonyms. Christianity conjures up ideas about perpetual virgins, strict sexual codes, alarmingly large families, purity culture, threats of eternal judgment, and a general absence of fun. It might come as some surprise, therefore, to realize that the Divine Plan included more seductresses than shrinking wallflowers. Let\u2019s begin with Rahab\u2014the woman who helped bring down the city of Jericho. After being freed from enslavement in Egypt, and wandering for forty years in the wilderness, the Israelites found themselves in Canaan (aka the Holy Land). Canaan wasn\u2019t empty and thus began a period of violent and bloody conquest. According to the Hebrew Bible, Joshua (who had succeeded Moses as the people\u2019s leader) sent two spies to scout out the military resources of the well-defended city of Jericho. Their deceptive plan was quickly uncovered, and the two spies took refuge at the house of a sex worker named Rahab. Instead of handing the spies over to her neighbors, Rahab hid them underneath the bundles of flax that were drying on the roof of her house. In exchange for her assistance the spies promised to save Rahab and her family from the impending invasion. They were spared when, according to the book of Joshua, everyone in the city\u2014man, woman, child, and pets alike\u2014were slaughtered (if this part of the story gives you pause it will come as some consolation that there\u2019s no archeological evidence to support it). Sex worker Rahab helped hide spies in her house. Lebrecht/Getty While some Christians might protest that Rahab\u2019s profession is incidental to the story, there\u2019s some academic debate about this. In one recent article Dr. Alexiana Fry asks \u201cDid the spies encounter Rahab because they were seeking sex?\u201d If James Bond has taught us anything, it\u2019s that spies have voracious sexual appetites. If that\u2019s the case then Rahab\u2019s profession is critically important. Then there\u2019s the messier and lesser-known story of Tamar in the book of Genesis. Tamar married Er, the son of Judah (the eponymous founder of the tribe of Judah) but Er died before they had any children. Judah commanded that Tamar marry Er\u2019s brother Onan in what is known as a levirate union. In this arrangement, when a man died without children, his brother would procreate with his widow and the resulting male offspring would become the deceased\u2019s legal heirs. (Yes, you did read that correctly. There\u2019s even a story in the New Testament in which Jesus is quizzed about a hypothetical situation in which a woman married seven brothers in succession). Onan, Er\u2019s younger brother, was perfectly happy to have sex with Tamar, but he didn\u2019t want to lose his additional share of Er\u2019s inheritance to a new baby. So, in the Bible\u2019s first instance of contraception, he withdrew and \u201cspilled his seed on the ground.\u201d God is unimpressed and kills Er, leaving Tamar widowed again. There is a third brother, Shelah, but he is too young to marry and so Tamar waits in her father-in-law\u2019s house for the boy to reach manhood. When he does, Judah reneges on his promise. Alone, used, and deceived, Tamar takes things into her own hands. Judah himself recently became a widower and when Tamar learned he was taking a trip she dressed herself up as a sex worker, veiled her face, and placed herself in his path. Judah did not recognize his daughter-in-law on the roadside and propositioned her. In their negotiations over the price of sex Tamar accepted the offer of a young goat but asked for Judah\u2019s seal, cord, and staff (the equivalent of his driver\u2019s license) as collateral until the goat arrived. Judah agreed and they exchanged goods. When Judah returns to swap out the goat for his personal effects the \u201cshrine prostitute\u201d had vanished. The embarrassed Judah decides to keep quiet about the whole thing. Judah and his daughter-in-law Tamar. Sepia Times/Getty Predictably, however, Tamar becomes pregnant, and her male relatives are on the cusp of burning her to death when she produces the seal, staff, and cord. Judah recognizes his property and concludes that her act of deception and prostitution was fair play: \u201cShe is more righteous than I,\u201d he says, \u201csince I wouldn\u2019t give her to my son Shelah.\u201d Tamar didn\u2019t have to sleep with her in-laws anymore and her twin sons became the heirs to Judah. In the New Testament, as is relatively well-known, Jesus regularly fraternizes with sex workers (not like that, though). In one story, that appears in various versions in the Gospels, a woman bursts into the home of Simon the leper in Bethany and anoints Jesus with a costly jar of perfumed ointment. (In 591 CE Pope Gregory the Great mistakenly identified this woman as Mary Magdalene, sparking two millennia of confusion about Mary M\u2019s profession.) The sulky disciples are quite sniffy about the whole thing and declare it a waste of money, but Jesus shuts that down. He responds that she has anointed him for burial, \u201cTruly I tell you, wherever the good news is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in remembrance of her.\u201d As Sarah Levin-Richardson has written in her book on The Brothel of Pompeii , sex workers were often gifted perfume by clients. The fact that this woman is moving around unaccompanied at night and has access to perfumed oil, thus, suggests that she was part of the world\u2019s oldest profession. A woman, who Pope Gregory the Great, mistakenly identified as Mary Magdalene anoints the feet of Jesus. Hulton Archive/Getty In Luke\u2019s version of the story, the woman\u2019s occupation is quite explicit, she is described as a \u201csinful woman.\u201d In this version, she washes his feet with her tears and dries them with her hair. Once again, Jesus rebukes her critics\u2014in this instance, a Pharisee. Though in this version Jesus does refer to the woman\u2019s many sins and forgives them, he does not ask her to change her profession or explicitly refer to sexual misconduct as being among her sins. This is in distinction to a story in the Gospel of John in which he directly tells a man he had just healed to \u201csin no more.\u201d At a minimum, Jesus isn\u2019t that hung up on her trade and was happy for her to use the fruits of her work to anoint him. Though some readers might think that these stories are outliers in a compendium of old-fashioned patriarchal morality, the women are not. Jesus\u2019s words about the woman who anoints him form one of his most secure prophecies: we are, in fact, still talking about her. As for Tamar and Rahab, in Christian tradition they are remembered as instrumental in the history of Israel and genealogy of Jesus himself. The Gospel of Matthew begins with a long list of ancestors that ties Jesus, through Joseph, to David and Abraham. It is, as you would expect, a long list of men begetting one another. But explicitly named in this catalog of men are five women: Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, the wife of Uriah (i.e. Bathsheba), and Mary, the mother of Jesus. What ties these women together? Well, while someone might argue that the four women who preceded Mary are outsiders and their inclusion signals that Jesus\u2019 message would be delivered to gentiles as well as Jews this argument doesn\u2019t quite work. How would these women be connected to Mary, a Jew? The other explanation is that all five women were involved in sexual scandals. Tamar and Rahab had practiced sex work; Ruth seduced and later married her kinsman Boaz; and, in the view of ancient readers, Bathsheba was an adulteress. What links them to Mary is the veil of suspicion that surrounded the conception of Jesus. In the Gospels she is explicitly identified as a virgin who had not had sex with anyone, but plenty of non-Christians found the tale a bit hard to believe if not outright laughable. The North African Christian writer Tertullian tells us that people accused Jesus of being the \u201cson of a carpenter or a whore.\u201d The pagan critic Celsus says that she was seeing a Roman soldier on the side. Mary might have been a virgin, but she had a bad reputation and was regularly slut shamed by Christianity\u2019s critics. Leaving Mary aside, the fact remains that for early Christians the women who broke the sexual rules were instrumental in the history of Israel and the generation of Jesus. Assertive women who used the resources they had to better their circumstances and those of their family members are implicitly valued and respected. More importantly they play a critical role in securing the success and survival of God\u2019s chosen people. The genealogy of Jesus\u00ad\u2014which omits the docile wives and virtuous homemakers in Israel\u2019s history\u2014is a tacit indictment of slut shaming writ large. As it turns out, well-behaved women rarely rate a mention in the history of Jesus. Candida Moss @candidamoss candidarmoss@gmail.com Got a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .",

        "content": "Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout \u2014 who was released last year from U.S. custody in a prisoner swap \u2014 this week criticized politicians who \u201cplay chess\u201d with detainees. \u201cI feel really sorry when this wheel of destiny go[es] through somebody else[\u2018s] li[fe] ruining it,\u201d Bout, who was exchanged for WNBA star Brittney Griner, . He added that people like Griner, or himself, sometimes \u201cpay a price\u201d because politicians try to \u201cplay chess, on this big chessboard which they call geopolitics.\u201d Bout, more commonly known as the \u201c ,\u201d also revealed that he told Griner \u201cgood luck\u201d during their prisoner exchange last year. Griner spent 10 detained in Russia for bringing vape cartridges with hashish oil with her. \u201cI said \u2026 \u2018I wish you good luck, and, you know, and we both went to our, you know, planes,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has faced from Republicans for the swap deal. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) called the exchange \u201ca gift\u201d to Russian President Vladimir Putin at the time. \u201cNegotiations for release of wrongful detainees are often very difficult, that\u2019s just a reality,\u201d White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in response to Republican criticism. Bout had been sentenced to 25 years in 2012 for charges related to trafficking weapons and conspiring to kill Americans. Because of Bout\u2019s dealing background, Fox News\u2019 Peter Doocy said Russia got a better deal in the wake of the swap because Griner is a professional athlete. \u201cThe professional athlete is also an American citizen, let\u2019s not forget that,\u201d Jean-Pierre pushed back. \u201cThe president felt that this was an opportunity to bring Brittney home.\u201d Bout in the recent interview was asked about the criticism, and he said it was similar to how the Russians felt when he was detained. \u201cWell, think of this, that the same outrage was in Russia when I was sentenced to 25 years. Many people would say, \u2018For what? Just for talking? Are you serious?\u2019 he told ESPN. \u201cThere is not even a proper translation to Russian of the crime of conspiracy,\u201d Bout continued. \u201cWe don\u2019t have such even the legal term, So, this is this same kind of outrage in Russia about my case and about many other cases.\u201d",

        "description": "Caesar salad can be a literally perfect dish \u2014 but that's unfortunately not always the case. So make it at home!",
        "content": "-- Shares Facebook Twitter Reddit Email Comfort food doesn't always have to be heavy, fattening or filling. As long as something lends some sense of familiarity and reassurance, some level of nostalgia or softness, then that food can be a comfort food \u2014 whether that's a rack of ribs , chicken parm , cheesecake or a quiche . For me, one dish that falls squarely within that paradigm is none other than Caesar salad. Related Tableside service deserves a renaissance \u2014 across all cuisines and price points Caesar salad is a nostalgia-inducing dish: I remember being a very little tyke and having my first Caesar and being astonished at the flavor. Later on, I enjoyed perhaps the best Caesar salad of my life at a castle in Kentucky (yup, you read that correctly). Then there's every single time I've enjoyed the Caesar at Houston's . And the list goes on and on. I am a little incensed, however, whenever I have a dry, unappealing side Caesar with some nondescript, overly white sludge that is no more than a poor excuse for dressing \u2014 which is all the more reason to make it at home. I've tweaked my recipe many a time, but I tend to emulate chef Anne Burrell's eggless recipe , just because I'm not too into the idea of loose, raw egg floating indiscriminately in my dressing (I guess I'm not equal opportunity, though, since I'm more than okay with it in raw cookie dough , albeit begrudgingly). It's also a great weeknight meal since it's a pretty streamlined dish to make. We need your help to stay independent Subscribe today to support Salon's progressive journalism As with most things, though, I'm very, very pointed with my Caesar proclivities, so here's a rundown of how I like to put mine together: Lettuces I'm a romaine and/or iceberg guy. Nothing in between: no frilly leaves, no microgreens , definitely no baby spinach. We need a heartier, sturdier leaf to hold up to the rich thickness of the dressing . Also, please dry your lettuces throughly and completely! It's immensely important. Croutons I like a garlicky, large, super-crisp crouton , so I often buy a baguette or Italian bread, cube it and then crisp it up in a pan or in the oven in lots of garlic-flavored oil. Also, be sure to both dry and then season them well. Some people have gotten into bread crumbs, which I actually love in salads, but I prefer the legitimate crunch of a whole crouton for a real classic, tableside , steakhouse Caesar vibe. It also helps with some textural differentiation throughout the salad. The egg discourse if you're into it, throw in an egg yolk or two! It adds to the viscosity and shine of the dressing, but I find the flavor change negligible and the sliminess of raw egg generally skeeves me out, so I leave it out. Garlic I'm normally a garlic aficionado through and through, oftentimes throwing in double or triple the amount that a recipe calls for, but that's for cooked garlic. I've gotten more and more sensitive to raw garlic lately; it's just too darn punchy, sharp and borderline acrid. I'd go with a single clove, grated on a microplane or minced super finely. You could also always use some garlic powder instead (maybe a sprinkle of its buddy onion powder , too?). Another option would be to forego the garlic in the dressing and cook the croutons with tons of garlic, so you're still getting the customary garlic flavor that way. A roasted garlic Caesar is also a superb idea. Cheese I adore a wild shower of freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano , ideally on a microplane, but pre-grated Parm is obviously totally fine. Some incorporate cheese into the dressing, which is also great, but I sometimes find that that causes the dressing to break or be a bit too solid for me? So I sometimes skip the cheese in the dressing and instead just adorn the top of the salad with an absolutely ludicrous amount of cheese. Staples You need the Worcestershire , you need the olive oil, you need the mustard, you need the vinegar. I often like to go with sherry , but a good red wine vinegar always works. Mustard-wise, I often go a little light on the Dijon because it can sometimes be a bit overpowering. You also need lots of lemon here. Buy organic or whole lemons. Roll them before juicing, use a reamer if you have it and use a fine-mesh strainer to catch seeds. Anchovies Unless you're Alison Roman, you're probably not consuming anchovies with reckless abandon on the regular. I don't buy them often and I don't have a special affinity for them, but they are a must in a \"real\" Caesar. I'd go with one or two, personally, but if you're all about that tinned fish lifestyle and are trying to add 10 \u2014 nobody's stopping you. It's your kitchen! Black pepper As I've written about before, I don't use black pepper often. I just find the sharp flavor too distracting in most foods. I always abide by the Burrell notion that salt is used in everything, while black pepper should be used as a seasoning would \u2014 only in particular dishes and for certain applications. Caesar salad, though, is one of the only times in which I use lots and lots (and lots and lots) of freshly cracked black pepper, both in the dressing and over the top before covering with a mountain of Parm. Don't skimp on it! It's essential for that iconic Caesar flavor. Protein additions Anything \u2014 or nothing \u2014works here, but you obviously cannot beat the classic grilled chicken . It's totally not necessary, though. I sometimes find that it weighs down the leaves or soaks up some of the dressing, leaving some of the salad itself undressed. Preparation I always make my dressing in a blender or VitaMix \u2014 I like the smoothness and consistency \u2014 but you can totally make it in a bowl with a large whisk. You want to make sure you're incorporating lots of air, though, so the dressing has some real heftness and body. You need to toss this salad! Do not just merely top some naked leaves with a spoonful of dressing and serve. This is the salad that the dressing needs to be properly so it's legitimately dispersed amongst the lettuces and croutons. I like using tongs for this, but if you have tossers, though, this is a perfect time to get them out. You can also take this in different directions by either grilling the romaine, which is always a fun touch, or serving it in more of a wedge-type siltation. I also sometimes like serving entire romaine \"planks\" \u2014 I love the texture and the fork-and-knife aspect \u2014 but the classic application is obviously always perfect. Up to you! Finally, be sure to use a truly enormous bowl; you'll need the space. A wooden one gives a fun, tableside appeal. Want more great food writing and recipes?

        "content": "The Saudi crown prince once vilified by President Joe Biden has been elevated from a fist-bump to a hearty handshake. Biden warmly greeted Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto leader, , after they appeared together along with several other leaders at the Group of 20 summit Saturday in New Delhi. The leaders had gathered to announce an ambitious plan to build a rail and shipping corridor linking India with the and Europe. Biden smiled and shook hands with the crown prince, who is often referred to by his initials , as the announcement wrapped up. This year\u2019s host, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, quickly draped his own hand over their hands. The cordial greeting was a sharp contrast to the last time Biden and the met, just over a year ago, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. During that encounter, Biden awkwardly greeted the crown prince with a fist bump, a moment roundly criticized by human rights activists, who were already upset at Biden\u2019s decision to meet with the Saudi leader. Bin Salman has been harshly criticized for his human rights violations. Joe Biden can\u2019t pronounce the names of other world leaders. Imagine what is going on in 38-year old Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s head listening to this idiot. America is a laughingstock. Great job Democrats. \u2014 Citizen Free Press (@CitizenFreePres) U.S. intelligence officials determined that the prince approved the 2018 murder of the U.S.-based writer , who was a tough critic of the kingdom\u2019s ruling family, Fred Ryan, who was publisher of The Washington Post at the time of last year\u2019s Biden-Prince Mohammed meeting, said the fist bump \u201cprojected a level of intimacy and comfort that delivers to MBS the unwarranted redemption he has been desperately seeking.\u201d Khashoggi was a contributor to the newspaper. Biden refused to speak to Prince Mohammed at the start of his administration. As a presidential candidate in 2020, Biden said he wanted to make the Saudis \u201cpay the price, and make them in fact the pariah that they are.\u201d But concerns about human rights eventually were eclipsed by other factors, including Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, the volatile oil market after Russia\u2019s invasion of , and recognition by the Biden administration that the crown prince will likely be an important voice of one of the Middle East\u2019s most important countries for years to come.

        "description": "Brian Ward, CEO of Savvy Gaming Group, is trying to change Saudi Arabia's reputation by leading its investments in gaming.",
        "content": "We're thrilled to announce the return of GamesBeat Next, hosted in San Francisco this October, where we will explore the theme of \"Playing the Edge.\" Apply to speak here and learn more about sponsorship opportunities here. At the event, we will also announce 25 top game startups as the 2024 Game Changers. Apply or nominate today ! Brian Ward, CEO of Savvy Games Group , has taken the lead in helping Saudi Arabia\u2019s attempt to move beyond its reputation for human rights abuses and being an oil nation to being a visionary technology leader bankrolling the game industry. This tension between the past and the future is ever-present in Saudi Arabia, where companies like Savvy Games Group \u2014 owned by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia \u2014 are trying to change perceptions through games while remaining cognizant of the kingdom\u2019s appetite for measured change. Ward believes people have to see the change happening in society on the ground in Saudi Arabia in order to understand how quickly things can happen under the new regime that is mostly supportive of the game industry. There is perhaps no other country where the clash between tradition and modernity \u2014 something my world history professor talked about so long ago \u2014 is so stark. The change and the deals have been happening at a dizzying rate. It\u2019s like a big game of Monopoly, and the playing board of the game industry is set up on a global scale. Savvy Games Group acquired Los Angeles-based mobile game publisher Scopely for $4.9 billion in April, and it bought a $1 billion stake in Sweden-based game publisher Embracer Group. It also acquired ESL Gaming and FaceIt in esports to create ESL FaceIt Group. And the Saudis have also bought stakes in Capcom, Nexon and Nintendo this year, building on stakes it acquired previously in Activision Blizzard, Take-Two Interactive and Electronic Arts. That has made the gaming world take notice. Savvy\u2019s big stakeholder, the Public Investment Fund (run by the Saudi Arabian government) is flush with cash from the oil boom and it has set aside $37.8 billion to build up Saudi Arabia\u2019s presence in the global games industry \u2013 with $13.3 billion of that earmarked for acquiring a major publisher. That\u2019s more money than anyone around the world is earmarking for gaming investments and acquisitions. It\u2019s a sign that the government is serious about weaning the country from oil. The Saudi Vision 2030 is a government program launched by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to diversify economically, socially and culturally, in line with the vision of bin Salman. The Saudis announced it in 2016, but the country remained about 74% dependent on oil exports as of 2021. The country understands that the oil economy could dry up in the next 27 years, and it has to have other jobs ready \u2014 and they are trickling in so far. For the games industry, this influx of Saudi money into games is not without controversy, as the Saudi funding is controversial and the company has only been at it since November 2021. Critics say that the regime of Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud doesn\u2019t respect human rights. As crown prince and prime minister, he was connected to the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 via alleged killers who had ties to the crown prince. Accepting funding from the Saudis under such a regime represents a moral quandary, as the Saudis have become a big source of funding in their efforts to diversify beyond their dependence on oil, which the world is in the process of moving away from in pursuit of clean energy. Saudi defenders say that all major sources of money in the world are tainted in some way, and accepting money from the Saudis does not mean you have to accept interference from the Saudis or embrace their agenda. Ward pointed out in an interview with GamesBeat that the country is undergoing change when it comes to women\u2019s rights and other freedoms, and it is serious about creating transformative results when it comes to diversity and new jobs associated with game studios. Still, given the fact that being gay is illegal in Saudi Arabia, The Last of Us Part 2 was banned in the country for having gay women in its leading roles. Ward has said the company aims to become a great games company and is not tied to a specific political agenda and he is not there for an \u201cimage makeover project.\u201d While change may be happening, it\u2019s not happening fast enough for critics. I caught up with Ward in an interview at the company\u2019s booth at the Gamescom expo in Cologne, Germany. Here\u2019s an edited transcript of our interview. Brian Ward: Sorry I wasn\u2019t able to meet before. GamesBeat: You guys were busy buying somebody. Brian Ward: That was a hectic time. GamesBeat: How are things going since then? Especially with acquiring Scopely. Ward: Very good. We\u2019re obviously delighted to have closed the transaction with Scopely. Their Monopoly Go product is fantastic. It\u2019s doing very well. The people are working super hard on integration. They\u2019ve been a pleasure to work with in that regard. So far we\u2019re delighted. GamesBeat: On things like esports, I wonder how much focus you have on MENA (Middle East/North Africa) versus the wider world. Ward: We\u2019re pretty globally focused. The live attendance on all the majors this year has been up. The viewership, the hours watched have been up. There have been some hiccups in the sector generally with publisher spend on esports this year, but overall the business has been doing great. We\u2019re focused on MENA, of course. The EFG folks are in the middle of executing on Gamers8. There are plans for that tournament to be bigger and more robust next year. There\u2019s a lot going on. The conference next week will be a good one. GamesBeat: Is that a first for them, or have they been doing them before? Ward: This is the second version of Next World Forum. Gamers8 started during COVID as Gamers Without Borders, for charity relief. This is the second version of both the G8 and the NWF. GamesBeat: Is there a feeling of progress as you come out of COVID? Esports had to take some huge hits during that time. It transformed a lot as well. Ward: I think we\u2019re beyond COVID. The capital markets, the economic situation last year and coming into this year, caused some publishers to pull back on their esports spend, which affected a couple of pieces of the business, but overall attendance is up. Viewership is up. There seems to be as much engagement as there was before from a fan point of view. GamesBeat: For Saudi gamers and Saudi esports fans, how would you describe the market? Ward: When we invested in EFG, it seemed that coming out of COVID \u2013 that was nearly two years ago now \u2013 it was an inflection point where engagement had changed or accelerated because of COVID, and there would be some consolidation in esports. There would be some dynamics that would sort themselves out, whether it\u2019s the relationship between players and teams and publishers and where the power base really sits. A lot of that still has to get sorted out. Team economics are not universally great. GamesBeat: The game industry itself, where do you see the trends developing? Ward: We\u2019re super excited, especially on the heels of closing Scopely. We\u2019re excited about mobile-first cross-platform opportunities. Scopely is also making great progress in direct payments. That\u2019s an interesting economic lever for us. For Savvy, we now have a great anchor in mobile. We\u2019re looking forward to figuring out how we can facilitate, like we\u2019re doing with Scopely, some partners in PC and console. GamesBeat: You\u2019re still looking around for opportunities? Ward: This year we haven\u2019t been looking at as many opportunities. We\u2019ve been focused internally on making sure we have the right leadership team in place. Scopely is a big acquisition. The integration is fairly involved. We\u2019re focused on making sure that we\u2019re putting some investment professionals in place, so we don\u2019t rely on external advisors as much. We\u2019re focused internally on our structure and governance and operating model, more so than looking for additional investments. GamesBeat: Were there some things that made you think that the period in which you were buying assets there \u2013 was that fortuitous in some ways? When there are downturns in the economy, prices for acquisitions are lower. It\u2019s a good time to buy. Did that matter to you? If you have strategic imperatives to move into a business fast, you probably don\u2019t care as much about the economic situation. Ward: That\u2019s true. It\u2019s very difficult to time the market. It\u2019s been fortuitous that valuations have come off a bit and those people with capital to employ have been in a market where it\u2019s been more difficult for people to find as many varied sources of capital as there were two years ago. That\u2019s advantageous to us. But we haven\u2019t pulled on that lever very hard. This year we\u2019ve been focused more internally. GamesBeat: For games it seems like there was a lot of pressure on valuations, after some very big excitement in 2021. Everybody thought that usage was going to go up forever. Is there a level-setting that you see that still reflects favorable trends? Ward: Overall, I think the trends are super favorable for the long term. We don\u2019t get too excited about this year versus last year or 2022 versus COVID. Long term we think this is probably the best entertainment business to be in. Yes, there\u2019s some sort of reconciliation. Figuring out where usage and engagement will land after COVID. But that will settle. GamesBeat: I listened to Take-Two\u2019s earnings call. It was interesting to hear Strauss Zelnick answer a question about games and Hollywood, all the synergy happening right now. Someone asked why they aren\u2019t doing more of that. He said, \u201cWe came from movies. It was a very hard business. There were many failures.\u201d For years everyone saw that the big opportunity was in games, so why would they go back in a big way? Although he did say that they\u2019re working on a Borderlands movie and some other projects. They\u2019re participating in that. But he felt like it was a no-brainer that gaming is still the more interesting business. Ward: It\u2019s kind of the flip side of the trend from 20 years ago, where movies became games. Now it\u2019s games becoming movies. GamesBeat: Do you think about that as an opportunity as well? Ward: Not yet. We\u2019re not focused on that at the moment. I still view us as a startup. We have maybe a couple hundred people in Saudi Arabia and 4,000 worldwide. We still have a lot of things to do in terms of building a games business. We have a pretty good esports business. GamesBeat: Are you focused on building a larger local staff? Ward: Very much so. The studio, which is now renamed Steer Studios, has done a super job. They now have about 80 people on two or three mobile teams, and 80% of them are Saudis. We\u2019re highly focused and highly incentivized against building out the local ecosystem. GamesBeat: How does that mix in with the Scopely business? Is it alongside Scopely? Ward: Scopely is very interested in the MENA region and expanding beyond their traditional markets. We expect that they\u2019ll be looking at opportunities in MENA and Saudi specifically. GamesBeat: How do you look back after some years on the issues around human rights that people have had with Saudi Arabia, whether or not they want to do business there? How is that turning out? Ward: My standard answer to this, or part of my standard answer, is for folks to take the time to understand what\u2019s going on there and how far this social transformation and economic diversification project is coming in the last five years. A tremendous amount of progress has been made toward Vision 2030 and all of this transformation. It\u2019s exciting. We\u2019re super happy to be part of it, part of this long-term journey. GamesBeat: Is there some sense of mission attached to that connected to Savvy? Ward: This is what really attracted me to this position and got me to move to Riyadh. I understood a bit about Vision 2030 and the economic diversification, social transformation aspect. But once I saw, once I visited for the first time and saw what that meant on the ground, I could see that this is kind of like China 35 years ago. The pace of change is astonishing. It seemed to be a unique opportunity to take part in something worthwhile. That\u2019s why I went there, and I think a lot of the people we\u2019ve hired and who have moved there are inspired by the same opportunity. GamesBeat: The flow of money into games, do you have any general observations about that? Is there some history to that flow? I just remember that when I joined VentureBeat 15 years ago, I thought I would stop covering games. There was a focus on venture capital for (tech), and there was (virtually) no venture capital for games. I thought I\u2019d end up covering tech more than games. But here we are 15 years later and GamesBeat is very big. Ward: You would know far more about this, but the level of engagement and the fan base and reach now of games, for those of us who\u2019ve been doing this almost 30 years \u2013 I remember thinking, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if we were eventually bigger than the music industry?\u201d Now we\u2019re bigger than those guys and the movies and somebody else put together. When you think about 3.2 billion people on the planet playing games on a regular basis, it\u2019s astonishing. GamesBeat: Saudi Arabia is also into building new cities and new structures. Do you have some sort of dream for that? How would building cities with games in mind happen? Ward: As you know, Vision 2030 encompasses all of those things. The giga-projects at NEOM and Qiddiya, which have significant \u2013 I mean, Qiddiya is essentially an entertainment-based city being built just west of Riyadh. We have a big part to play in the game section of that city. NEOM has a big games component to it as well. All these things are tied together under not only Vision 2030, but the national strategy for games and esports. Saudi, to my knowledge, is the only country on the planet that\u2019s announced a national strategy backed by the government for our sector. All of these things are interconnected in some pretty major ways. GamesBeat: The one hiccup that we\u2019ve seen lately is whether or not you were going to do the investment in Embracer. I don\u2019t know how you would signal to the rest of the market what that means. That particular deal is one that maybe wasn\u2019t going to happen. Is there any change in strategy? Ward: We don\u2019t have a change in our strategy. Our strategy has been consistent for the last two years. When we made our initial significant investment in Embracer, we had great faith in the leadership and the long-term strategic vision for Embracer. That hasn\u2019t changed either. We\u2019re very happy with our investment in Embracer over the long term. GamesBeat: The interest in doing large deals, is that still part of what you want? Ward: I think Scopely is the sixth-largest M&A deal in our industry\u2019s history. We\u2019re still interested, and we\u2019ve deployed maybe 25% of the capital designed to be allocated to us over the long term. We still have a significant part of our mandate to fulfill. GamesBeat: Do you have an interest in making sure you\u2019re not perceived as investing at valuations that are too high, or throwing too much money at your targets? Ward: We employ a lot of excellent and well-paid advisors to give us good opinions on these things. We trust the advice they give us. We think we\u2019ve done deals that have been very beneficial to Saudi and fair to both parties. If we looked at the transaction value on Scopely today we\u2019d be very pleased with how that\u2019s working out, given our mission. It\u2019s long term. People probably thought Amazon paying a billion dollars for Twitch was crazy at the time. GamesBeat: The good old days, when prices were low. For women in Saudi Arabia, do you feel like there are real opportunities for change for them? Ward: This is the thing that surprised me. I didn\u2019t have any personal knowledge or experience of the region. To see firsthand what was going on there in relation to opportunities for women, just generally speaking, was a real eye-opener. In a studio, which has nearly 80 people so far \u2013 this is a development studio. Almost 30% of that workforce are women. At any studio anywhere in the world that would be a pretty remarkable number. There\u2019s an equally high percentage of women in the Saudi workforce generally. It\u2019s exciting. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019m really happy about. When the Scopely guys came to visit, around the time of the closing, or just prior to the closing, we had a lunch for Scopely leadership and all of the local women employees in Saudi. The Scopely folks said they were blown away by the level of energy, enthusiasm, knowledge, and professionalism in that group. One of them said he wished he could bottle up that energy and take it back to California. GamesBeat: U.S. money has been going all over the world for decades. I suppose you could put an interpretation on that money. When China was also in the position of being able to finance a lot of the world, I think people wondered if they have a philosophy that also gets exported along with those investments in all those companies. Do they run these companies in a Chinese way? What is your own view as far as the next entity that really has the opportunity to invest all over the world? Is there a philosophy you\u2019d like to export, but also maybe one that stays at home in Saudi Arabia as well? Ward: There isn\u2019t a philosophy, other than we\u2019ve always intended to be and have been consistent in communicating this \u2013 we\u2019ve been given carte blanche to operate like a true games company, consistent with the values of our industry, what people consider to be important. That\u2019s been true. That was one thing I was pretty alive to when I first thought about the opportunity, because to your point, Chinese companies tend to operate \u2013 not all of them, but they tend to operate in a Chinese way. Western companies operate in a western way. But I can\u2019t say there\u2019s any defining set of values around being a Saudi games company. We\u2019re just trying to be a games company, period. GamesBeat: One interesting data point, maybe, that I was thinking about now. I wrote a profile on this guy named Amir Satvat who works for Amazon. He\u2019s kind of a quant. During the big layoffs that started happening in the fall, he started scraping all the game industry sites for job openings. He aggregated them into a spreadsheet on LinkedIn and made it available for everyone to look at. Here\u2019s all the jobs. He came up with 732 companies and 14,000 jobs that are open. The fun part was that he\u2019s noticed that for the last six weeks or so, that number has been steady. He sees that as a stabilization happening over a relatively short amount of time. Before that openings were tending to go down. Does that mean anything to you, that the collective number of jobs in the game industry is starting to go back up? Ward: I\u2019m not an expert by any stretch. I would anticipate that most of the post-COVID reconciliation of how many users there are, the engagement level and so forth has sorted itself out in terms of how many people we need to meet demand. We should start to be back to business as usual. That\u2019s what I would expect. GamesBeat: There\u2019s AI as well. Nobody knows what that\u2019s going to mean. I talked to a professor a few weeks ago who was saying that we could have a 10% boost to world GDP by 2032 with all the AI advances happening now. That\u2019s $11 trillion. That\u2019s happening. He thinks there\u2019s going to be more change in the next 10 years from AI than in the last 150 years of industrial revolution. One of his guys looked at a typical 2,000-person enterprise and found that jobs in that enterprise would probably be done with one-third to two-thirds fewer people. All these things seem to suggest we\u2019re about to be in another time of change. We thought there was change already in the last few decades, but there\u2019s more coming. Ward: But isn\u2019t that one of the best things about our industry, the constant change and development and evolution of it? I think AI is going to add a lot of jobs. There will be shifting in who does what. Did we need less artists when SpeedTree was introduced? No, we needed more. More tools mean more stuff gets done. That\u2019s the way I view it.

        "content": "When you're blessed \u2014 or burdened, depending on how you look at it \u2014 with more late-summer fruit than you know what to do with, turn to the humble . It has all the comforting flavors of a pie minus the skill required to roll out a perfectly flaky dough, and, more importantly, plus the delightful crunch of baked oats. Best of all, a crisp gives new purpose to fruit that might be approaching its last leg; the kind that's still edible but is too mushy to eat on its own. In its , a crisp is composed of fruit coated in sugar and flour and topped with oats tossed with melted butter (and then more sugar and flour). With such a simple foundation, there's plenty of room to experiment with unlikely ingredients. The next time you make a crisp at home, add a little tang with a dollop of mayonnaise in the oat topping. Though it might seem like a hard sell, trust us: It'll balance out the sweetness of the berries and add some depth of flavor to the dish. Hellmann's, which is among the top four at the time of this writing, will be the first to tell you that fruit crisps and mayo go hand in hand. The brand features a blueberry crisp recipe with mayonnaise on its , which calls for half a cup of the condiment in the oat topping. (Aside from Hellmann's, also calls for mayo in its recipe for apple cobbler, proving that the ingredient pairs well with all kinds of fruity desserts.) Even people who love sweets know that overripe blueberries need a little acid to take the edge off their sweetness, which is why so many call for lemon juice. In a crisp, mayonnaise adds just the right amount of zing, thanks to distilled white vinegar and/or lemon juice. While store-bought mayo is totally acceptable, whipping up a might lead to an even tastier crisp. All you need is an egg, olive oil, lemon juice or vinegar, and salt. Adding mayonnaise to sweets is an older practice than you might think. Some historians trace the origin of to the Great Depression, when eggs and other dairy products were hard to come by. Mayonnaise, which was inexpensive and easy to find, added moisture and body to baked goods. The first known published recipe for mayonnaise cake, which appeared in a 1927 issue of the , gave rise to the dessert's second wave of popularity during World War II, when baking essentials like sugar, milk, eggs, and butter were rationed. Today's unpredictable egg prices \u2014 which, after months of inflation, are \u2014 might not be dire enough to inspire a mass resurgence of mayonnaise-based baking. Still, it's good to know that the condiment is always there in tough times. Regardless of the state of the economy, however, mayonnaise is definitely worth adding to your next fruit crisp.",

        "content": "Just about every country in the world committed to keeping climate change in check in 2015. This week, the United Nations issued its first report card for this goal and found that the world is falling behind while time is running out. Under the , countries agreed to pitch in what they could to slash greenhouse gas emissions. Their initial proposals were nowhere near enough, so the accord created a mechanism called the global stocktake to keep everyone accountable. Unlike other UN climate change reports that are meant to be informative and shy away from policy recommendations, the is explicitly meant to spur countries to act. It\u2019s a blunt progress assessment, and it lays out how much further countries must go in their emissions commitments the next time they come to the negotiating table at , which will be held in the United Arab Emirates this December. \u201cThe Paris Agreement has driven near-universal climate action,\u201d the report notes, but \u201cmuch more is needed now on all fronts.\u201d The task ahead is immense: According to the report, global emissions need to be slashed 43 percent by 2030 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, one of the main goalposts of the Paris agreement. But the world has already warmed about 1.2 degrees so far above preindustrial averages and is on track to pass the key threshold in the next few years. So when negotiators reconvene at the next climate summit, the stocktake will shape the discussion. \u201cIt carries a lot of weight,\u201d said European Climate Foundation CEO Laurence Tubiana, who helped negotiate the Paris agreement. \u201cThe [stocktake] is looking backwards, but even more importantly setting the direction for the next phase of climate policymaking.\u201d Among its recommendations, the report unapologetically calls for \u201cphasing out all unabated fossil fuels\u201d and for a \u201cradical decarbonization of all sectors of the economy.\u201d But in a world facing economic turmoil, energy shocks, and unrelenting opposition from the biggest polluters, there are open questions about whether leaders will heed the message at all, and what they\u2019ll actually do about it. Coal, oil, and natural gas need to go The stocktake says in stark terms that there can be no new fossil fuel infrastructure in a world committed to keeping warming in check, including phasing out the existing coal industry before 2050. The exact language here is important. At , countries fought over every word around fossil fuels, whether they should call for a \u201cphase out\u201d or a more watered-down phrase like \u201cenergy transition.\u201d The latter leaves room for new fossil fuels without looking like governments are going back on their word. But the stocktake, which will inform the political process from here on out, echoes the findings of other global bodies that no new fossil fuel infrastructure should be built in a world aligned with 1.5 degrees. There\u2019s some vagueness in what \u201cunabated\u201d means, however, and it\u2019s likely to be a contentious topic at the next COP. The language leaves room, Tubiana explained, for remaining fossil fuels to rely on technology like carbon capture and storage. \u201cBy 2050 we\u2019ll still have fossil fuels in the pipeline, the question is how much,\u201d Tubiana said. One key barrier to transitioning from fossil fuels is the trillions of dollars in subsidies that governments pour into the industry year after year. A recent analysis from the International Monetary Fund found these subsidies have only grown; they surged to , $2 trillion more than in 2021. \u201cThe removal of fossil fuel subsidies is a key strategy for addressing structural economic barriers that can perpetuate inertia to change and prevent cost-effective low-carbon alternatives from being adopted at scale,\u201d the report says. The stocktake also emphasizes the need to address emissions across the economy. Governments can\u2019t overlook the role of sectors like industry, which contributes to 25 percent of global emissions, and , which contributes 15 percent. Reducing these emissions requires targeting the demand and the supply in these sectors. For example, in transportation, regulations and incentives will help to phase out the internal combustion engine and push manufacturers to offer at a vast scale, but governments also need to think about reducing the need for private vehicles altogether through tactics like public transit. This extends to sectors like international and , both areas that are hard to decarbonize and have often been ignored in international climate negotiations. The stocktake is clear that the time for small, incremental change is over: We need to think in terms of systems-wide change, and a wide breadth of to make deeper emissions cuts. \u201cIf you\u2019re rowing and you can turn your oar faster and faster, but if it\u2019s not really going deep enough, you won\u2019t get anywhere,\u201d said , director of the World Resources Institute\u2019s International Climate Initiative. \u201cWe need to think in pace and speed, of course, but we also need depth.\u201d Everyone is doing something, but everyone needs to do more The test now is whether countries will make the \u201crapid and deep\u201d greenhouse gas cuts the report says are required, delivering more financing and even deeper emissions cuts in the next round of pledges in 2025. But countries are dealing with other challenges too, and that will also shape what they bring to the table at COP28. Shocks to food and , along with inflation, may mean there is less money to invest in clean energy. Major fossil fuel companies are also trying to influence the discussions and maintain their market share. Meanwhile, many nations are still struggling to meet their own self-imposed pledges. The US, for example, has set a goal of slashing carbon pollution 50 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 while contributing $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund. But it\u2019s struggling to meet both goals, even after the passage of last year. Some countries have even seen their So mustering the political will to make these drastic changes is going to be an immense challenge. But at the same time, cleaner energy is more affordable than ever and the stocktake says a transition away from fossil fuels is within our grasp. In many parts of the world, wind and are the cheapest sources of new energy, sometimes undercutting existing fossil fuel sources. \u201cThere are now sufficient cost-effective opportunities to address the 2030 emissions gap,\u201d the report says. The challenges are entirely political hurdles.",

        "content": "Forbes Leadership Leadership Strategy Next Recession Not Likely A Disaster Bill Conerly Senior Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. I connect the dots between the economy ... and business! Following Sep 9, 2023, 07:30am EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Job seekers in 2008-09 recession. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) Getty Images The next recession will not be a disaster. I expect a recession to begin early in 2024, or possibly late this year, and that frightens many people. But recessions do not hurt most people, though they certainly can be very harmful to some. Employment in Recessions Unemployment rises during recessions, but not as much as we seem to fear. In the recessions between 1948 and 2019, the unemployment rate during the downturns was 1.4 percentage point higher than in the 12 months preceding the recession. The average time spent unemployed increased by less than one week during recessions. Working hours are cut in recessions, but by only 24 minutes a week on average. (The Data Note at the end of this article explains the methodology behind the numbers in this article.) Definition of Recession In assessing the data, we must remember that economists define a recession as the period when economic activity is declining. Once the decline is over and the economy turns up a little, we say the recession is over even though we have not yet recovered all of the lost ground. For some variables, the data often look their worst just after the recession has technically ended. Home Prices in Recession The median and average selling prices of homes usually rise in recession. That\u2019s surprising given what happened in 2008-09, when prices fell six percent by our comparison of the recession average to the 12 prior months. From the peak for prices (which occurred a year before the recession began), to the trough (two years after the recession ended), the decline was a whopping 19%. Recessions are not good for home prices. But prices usually rise over the long haul. Recessions typically slow the rise without turning prices downward. Of the ten recessions for which we have data (not counting 2020), only one shows a clear decline in prices. Eight recessions had home price increases, with the 1990 recession ambiguous.

Keep in mind that delinquent means at least 30 days late. Most delinquencies do not result in foreclosure. Banks write off more consumer loans in recession, but by less than one percentage point. Commercial real estate is even safer, with charge-offs increasing by only 0.6 percentage points. Business non-real estate lending charge-offs rise by a similar amount. Most Recession Effects Temporary In the typical economic model, the effects of a recession are temporary because the economy bounces back with above-normal growth rates, regaining its trend line. There have been some studies finding long-lasting impacts on those people who tried to find their first jobs during a recession and on people who were laid off in a recession. These studies are suggestive rather than definitive given data limitations. The most cited study found the impacts lasted seven to ten years but were not permanent. 2008-09 Recession Was Unusually Bad Today\u2019s fear of recession probably derives from the 2008-09 experience, which was especially harsh. In terms of overall impact on gross domestic product, that recession was twice as bad as the average recession preceding it. GDP declines in recessions. Dr. Bill Conerly based on data from U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis The chart shows substantial variation from one recession to another. For other variables, such as the average duration of unemployment, the range is comparably large. The largest recession increase was 2.2 weeks; the smallest 0.2 weeks. That illustrates that each recession is unique. The underly economy evolves over time, making the likely effects of a recession in the 2020s different from the 1950s. In addition, each recession occurs with unique external influences, such as world oil prices. Policy responses to recession also vary from case to case. As a result, we should not expect any particular downturn to mirror a past recession. But the past does give us an idea of the likely range of possibilities. Data Note: Recessions are defined by the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private non-profit organization. I do not include the 2020 recession in these calculations because it was atypical, being just two months in duration but very severe in magnitude. Some of the data series are not available back to 1948, so their averages were calculated over shorter time periods. Comparison of recessions with the 12 months preceding the recession is done because of drift over time in unemployment and other variables. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn . Check out my website .

        "description": "Most of West Maui will officially reopen to travelers next month under a new wildfire emergency proclamation signed by Hawaii's governor",
        "content": "Most of West Maui will officially reopen to travelers Oct. 8 under a new wildfire emergency proclamation signed on Friday by Gov. Josh Green. Nonessential travel to much of the island's western coastline has been strongly discouraged since devastating wildfires killed at least 115 people in the historic town of Lahaina last month. State tourism officials initially urged travelers to stay away from Maui so residents and agencies could focus on emergency response efforts and supporting those displaced by the fires. In mid-August, officials began encouraging tourists to return to other parts of Maui, avoiding the burn zone and spending money to help the region recover. On Thursday, Green told a meeting of the state Council on Revenues that he expected authorities to reopen most of West Maui to travelers in October, with the exception of the fire-damaged neighborhoods. The area, which includes beach resorts in Kaanapali, north of historic Lahaina, has 11,000 hotel rooms. That\u2019s half Maui\u2019s total. In the emergency proclamation signed Friday, the governor said the previous guidance that strongly discouraged nonessential travel to West Maui will be discontinued Oct. 8. Tourism is a major economic driver in , and the wildfire disaster prompted state officials to lower their 2023 economic growth prediction for the entire state to 1.1%, down from 1.8%. The number of visitors arriving on Maui sank about 70% after the Aug. 8 fire, down to 2,000 a day, and only half of the available hotel rooms there are occupied, said Hawaii Lodging & Tourism Association president Mufi Hannemann. Airlines have begun offering steep discounts on flights to Hawaii, and some resorts have slashed room rates by 20% or are offering a fifth night free.",

        "content": "The reforms encompass comprehensive cryptocurrency licensing, covering a spectrum of activities, and the introduction of taxation for licensed entities. The legislative changes, as , span various facets of the cryptocurrency industry, heralding a progressive shift in how Uzbekistan views and regulates digital assets. Notably, these amendments extend to cryptocurrency exchanges, mining pools, cryptocurrency storage services, and mining operations. The cornerstone of this regulatory framework is the requirement for cryptocurrency-related entities to obtain licenses to operate legally within the country. This proactive measure aims to establish a regulated environment that safeguards both investors and the broader financial system while promoting innovation and economic growth. One of the fundamental aspects of the new regulations is taxation. Once licensed, cryptocurrency entities are obligated to contribute to the country\u2019s tax revenue. This signifies the recognition of cryptocurrencies as legitimate financial assets in Uzbekistan, subject to the same fiscal responsibilities as traditional businesses. The move aligns with a global trend among governments seeking to harness the potential of cryptocurrencies while ensuring adherence to established financial and legal standards. It provides clarity to market participants, fostering an atmosphere of trust and transparency in the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. Uzbekistan\u2019s commitment to embracing the cryptocurrency space not only brings regulatory clarity but also opens the doors for local and international crypto enthusiasts, investors, and entrepreneurs to participate in a secure and regulated ecosystem.",

By some estimates , the BRICS nations currently represent about 40% of the world's population and roughly a quarter of its GDP.

Reactions from Western observers are mixed, with some playing down the potential for any economic or political rivalry with the group.

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Let's take a look into some of the recent developments in one of the hottest artificial intelligence stocks around right now. The post Is C3.ai Ready for Lift-Off? Key Factors to Watch for AI Stock. appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Last week, I mentioned in my article how C3.ai (NYSE: AI ) is a significant player in AI, but its high valuation draws investor scrutiny despite its potential. This is a company that\u2019s certainly polarizing, and for good reason. As far as companies viewed as battlegrounds in the artificial intelligence discussion, AI stock certainly makes the list (and for more reasons than just its ticker). Accordingly, with so much attention being paid to this artificial intelligence and automation play, let\u2019s dive into what investors may want to keep in mind as potential catalysts or headwinds on the horizon. Here are a few things I\u2019m keeping an eye on right now investors may want to watch. Recent Earnings Report C3 AI CEO Thomas M. Siebel expressed the growing global interest in enterprise AI adoption and strong traction with C3 Generative AI. C3.ai\u2019s Q1 earnings exceeded expectations, but revenue fell short of Wall Street estimates, and the revenue outlook for AI stock was also lower than expected. In the July quarter, the company reported an adjusted loss of 9 cents per share compared to a 12-cent loss the previous year, with revenue increasing by 11% to $72.36 million. C3.ai\u2019s Q1 results beat estimates with a loss of 9 cents per share and $72.36 million in revenue. However, its Q2 outlook fell short of expectations, leading AI stock to drop 4.2% to $30.15 in after-hours trading. Analysts had predicted a 17-cent loss and $73.8 million in revenue, while the company\u2019s guidance is for a 12-cent loss and revenue of $72-76.5 million. I\u2019m going to be keeping a close eye on how guidance improves (or not) in upcoming earnings reports. C3.ai Fundamentals As an AI industry pioneer, the firm, though recent losses, anticipates profitability by 2025 . With management holding 26%, alignment with investors is clear. The stock is rebounding from a deep 2021-2022 bear market, bottoming at $10/share in December 2022 and now trading at $31/share in a volatile 2023. Bulls hope for an earnings-driven breakout, while bears expect a gap down and decline. During earnings season, what matters most to me is how the market and a company respond to the news. Remember, limit losses and don\u2019t go against market trends. C3.ai\u2019s stock surged in 2023 due to excitement around OpenAI and generative AI. The company expects revenue to grow as AI pilot projects expand, making it a notable AI stock with a strong Relative Strength Rating of 97. C3.ai went public in December 2020, raising $651 million. The company specializes in AI applications for industries like energy, finance, and defense. It recently shifted its pricing model from subscription to consumption-based. This could lead to significant growth over the long-term, but also comes with some risks. Investors will need to watch how this shift affects the company\u2019s fundamentals and growth prospects moving forward. What Now C3.ai is undeniably pricey given its current growth rate, but this is likely to change as growth accelerates. Analysts project an impressive 51% annual earnings growth for the next five years. With a vast $791 billion market to tap into, C3.ai has the potential to achieve this. Investors open to a premium valuation for C3.ai\u2019s promising future may see opportunity in its recent dip. As growth speeds up, Wall Street\u2019s confidence is likely to increase, potentially driving long-term gains for this AI stock. That said, this company\u2019s valuation is a sticking point, making AI stock one I think investors can trade, but may have difficulty owning right now.

        "content": "Enterprise Tech As Technology Expands, Industry Definitions Get Murky Joe McKendrick Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. I track how technology innovations move markets and careers Following Sep 9, 2023, 12:09pm EDT | Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Toss-up: tech company or manufacturer? getty The US Census Bureau maintains a very meticulous list of industry categories, known as the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). This is recognized as the definitive guide to understanding who falls into which category \u2014 be it copper, nickel, lead, and zinc mining; or dog and cat food manufacturing; or sports and recreation instruction. But what happens when every company becomes a technology company? It may become more difficult to pigeonhole an organization into a single category. Large enterprises with substantial M&A budgets have been dabbling in diversification for decades. Remember when Sears got into banking? Or Exxon\u2019s foray into office information systems? Now, with the advent of technology and disrupted business models, facilitating well-connected ecosystems of partners and innovators, many companies are jumping across NAICS classifications not only into adjacent industries, but outside their core sectors all together. For example, manufacturers are increasingly building up capacity as maintenance services providers \u2014 what\u2019s referred to as servitization. \u201cEntire industries are moving from traditional customer interactions to connected, long-term customer relationships,\u201d a report from Accenture illustrates. For example, with intelligent sensors within the units they install, elevator manufacturers now provide ongoing, 24x7 service along with preventative maintenance service to building and facilities operators, There\u2019s another twist. A majority of equipment manufacturers, 76%, either currently offer or plan to offer Equipment-as-a-Service options for customers, a survey released in August 2022 by Relayr finds. Within this model, an original equipment manufacturer rents equipment to end users, versus one-time purchases. Then there is the emerging Manufacturing as a Service model, based on a \u201cmachine economy,\u201d as described in a recent report out of the Industry IoT Consortium. This economy is being built upon \u201ca network of smart, connected, and economically independent devices and machines acting as autonomous market participants, executing economic transactions and other activities with little to no human intervention.\u201d MORE FOR YOU Apple Leak Details All-New iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro Price Changes Apple Loop iPhone 15 Pro Launch Dates Confirmed iPhone 15 Delays Apple s Expensive China Problem Android Circuit Google Confirms Pixel 8 Microsoft Remembers Surface Duo Honor Magic V2 Wins IFA Manufacturers aren\u2019t the only types of companies expanding their realms through technology. For example, \"there is crossover between healthcare and technology in telemedicine,\" says Joe Collura , vice president of solution engineering at SS&C Blue Prism. \"The energy and environmental industries cross over in delivering renewable energy solutions such as solar, wind and hydropower.\" Two adjacent industries \u2014 banks and insurance \u2014 are increasingly blending their offerings within applications and mobile apps, a survey of 200 global financial services executives from Chubb finds. An example would be shipping insurance offered with online product purchases. At this time, a majority of financial executives report that up to 10% of their revenues come from insurance \u2014 a level that is expected to double over the next three years. \u201cA convergence between banking, insurance and wealth management has resulted in consumers having an average of 6.3 financial products, but only half of which are from their main bank,\u201d confirms Muqsit Ashraf , strategy lead for Accenture. \"The boundaries between industries are increasingly blurring with extending value chains that can unlock value opportunities through new products and services.\u201d The hybridization of industry groups is now seen across the spectrum. \u201cWe operate across 19 industries at Accenture and often help our clients cross into adjacent industries,\u201d says Ashraf. \u201cThere has been a sharp rise in ecosystem deals \u2013 where acquirers look to gain access to assets from outside of their core businesses.\u201d Perhaps the most striking example of cross-industry pollination is the widespread evolution for many companies into technology companies. \"Industry hybridization has become more pervasive as technology continues to advance and industries overlap in unprecedented ways,\" says Collura. \"Regardless of the industry, almost every company has transformed into a technology company, as it is now essential to provide seamless customer service and solutions powered by artificial intelligence and robotic process automation.\" Both \u201cphysical and digital technologies are accelerating this trend,\u201d says Ashraf. \u201cOn the digital side, technologies like generative AI are fundamentally changing the ways we work across industries. AI will enable gains in customer experience, productivity, capital efficiency and business resilience. In other instances, it will introduce new business models and ways of collaborating that can increase crossover in industries.\u201d With increased industry hybridization come many unknowns that need to be understood. \u201cThese unknowns are around technology, market potential, customer appetite, and business and operating models,\u201d Ashraf cautions. Regulatory and legal challenges are also a potential issue. \u201cDifferent industries may have distinct regulations, standards and compliance requirements,\u201d says Collura. \u201cPrivacy and security concerns come to mind as the integration of technologies from different industries can increase the potential for data breaches, cyberattacks and privacy violations.\u201d Communication and collaboration across and beyond industries is essential. \u201cThe ecosystem can come together to offer new products and services underpinned by innovative business and commercial models,\u201d says Ashraf. \u201cWhen companies are deciding whether to build, buy or partner to secure capabilities they need for growth, M&A and partnering jump to the top of the list \u2013 along with joint ventures, equity investments and other financing vehicles.\u201d Partnerships, M&A and organic growth \"all play a role in the evolution of businesses,\" Collura agrees. \"Technological advances and rapidly changing consumer demand are equally responsible for driving further hybridization. These factors go hand-in-hand as the unprecedented amount of venture capital in recent years has enabled more startups, acquisition and opportunities for synergy between companies.\" Follow me on Twitter .

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Here's why Meta Platforms remains a top option in the technology space for long-term value investors in this current environment. The post META Stock Outlook: 3 Catalysts That Could Fuel Meta Platform\u2019s Next Rally appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) had a turbulent 2022, plunging from a high of roughly $380 per share to the $88 level, and then more than tripling in early 2023. At around $300 per share at the time of writing, META stock has certainly become one of the come back stories investors like to see. Those who have held this stock through the turbulence are none the worse for the wear, especially if those same investors bought the stock years ago. Of course, n ews often mirrors stock performance, and it\u2019s crucial to remember the negative headlines about Meta during its decline. Now, optimism abounds for many large-cap tech stocks . That said, investors must consider whether it\u2019s overvalued or rightfully bullish after its roughly 10% decline from its recent peak. Here are three catalysts I think are worth watching when it comes to Meta right now. Meta Platforms is Being Re-Rated Higher Among 42 analysts , 40 rate Mets Platforms stock as \u201cbuy,\u201d with none issuing a recent \u201csell\u201d rating, despite its August decline. Analysts, like Scott Devitt from Wedbush, see potential in Meta\u2019s job cuts leading to improved margins. Devitt notes enhanced monetization in newer areas like Reels and click-to-message ads, setting a $350 price target for META stock. Similarly, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) analysts, with a $375 price target, anticipate renewed enthusiasm for Meta\u2019s stock in 2024 once spending targets are clearer. As more analysts jump on Meta Platforms as a potential long-term opportunity, I expect more price target hikes and upgrades on the horizon. Strong Fundamentals Meta stands out in the tech sector with just 21.6% of its capitalization comprised of debt, a modest figure compared to other tech firms. Meta\u2019s free cash flow, around $24 billion this year , surpasses its total debt of approximately $37 billion, a rarity in the corporate world. This robust cash flow has allowed Meta to repurchase 101 million of its own shares in the past year, benefiting shareholders and boosting stock prices. Meta\u2019s return on invested capital (or ROIC) historically ranged from 15% to 20%, ensuring that the money used for stock buybacks generates similar returns for shareholders. While criticism exists for Meta\u2019s investment in the metaverse, which has yet to yield expected profits, it has lowered ROIC to 14%, still strong compared to many companies. Meta\u2019s robust fundamentals extend to its market share, with Facebook commanding 53.1% of all social media visits (excluding Instagram). This significant presence offers multiple avenues for monetization, irrespective of the metaverse\u2019s success. AI Is The Main Near-Term Catalyst Meta Platforms understands the need for substantial investments in specific areas. It\u2019s a manageable challenge as long as the company can maintain strong revenue growth. While Q2 2023 showed an 11% year-over-year revenue increase, the focus now shifts to what will drive revenue growth in the latter half of 2023 and 2024. Meta Platforms is said to be working on an AI bot for enhancing business customer service and an internal AI tool designed to boost staff productivity. Of course, given the attention around artificial intelligence of late, this has garnered some attention. That said, over the longer-term, we\u2019ll have to see how this actually impacts the company\u2019s bottom line (if it\u2019s more or less like Meta\u2019s move into the metaverse, for example). What Now for Meta Platforms? While Meta shifts its focus to Threads and monetizing Instagram/WhatsApp, the metaverse project might lose some prominence. However, analysts expect double-digit earnings per share growth (around 26.7%) over the next twelve months, which could propel the stock higher, given the historical link between EPS and stock prices. Consider the potential if they redirect metaverse spending is redirected elsewhere, possibly restoring ROIC to its historical levels. This could result in more substantial share buybacks and higher analyst targets due to improved monetization and ROIC. Investors should seize this opportunity. On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a LONG position in META. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines .",

        "description": "Cirrus Aircraft, after several years of strong growth, is headed for an initial public offering on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.",
        "content": "Cirrus Aircraft, after several years of strong growth, is headed for an initial public offering on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. The IPO venue may seem surprising, but not when you consider the Duluth, Minnesota-based company's atypical ownership: the Chinese government. The state-owned Chinese company that took control of Cirrus in 2011 has presided over a period of stability, including the successful launch of a new jet business. However, the company, aerospace giant AVIC, is on a U.S. government investment sanctions list aimed at companies linked to China's military. Two AVIC-controlled companies related to Cirrus are on a separate U.S. export control list due to their Chinese military association. Heightened tensions between China and the U.S. have so far had \"minimal\" impact on Cirrus, the company noted in its IPO filing. Still, it said an \"escalation in geopolitical tension ... could lead to a material adverse effect on our business.\" It's questionable whether a Chinese buyout of Cirrus would even be approved nowadays given the increasingly tense relations between the United States and China, analysts said. \"If a similar deal was brought [forward] today, there would be a lot more political barriers,\" Charlie Vest, associate director at Rhodium Group, a New York-based research and company. \"These are very different times in the relationship between the U.S. and China and the political dynamics of Chinese investments in the U.S. have changed.\" AVIC would ultimately still control Cirrus after the IPO, which aims to sell up to 20% of the company and raise roughly $200 million to $400 million. However, Zean Nielsen, the company's CEO, said Cirrus is operationally independent of its shareholders. He called Chinese government ownership \"just one of those things that just is. It doesn't really change how I run the company.\" \"My job is to take care of customers and employees the best I know how,\" he said. Cirrus readily complies with federal rules on Chinese investment in the U.S., he said. \"All the things we need to disclose, we happily do.\" Cirrus has been on a hot streak since Nielsen, a former Tesla executive, became CEO in 2019. The company's revenue grew from $586 million in 2020 to $894 million last year, while its profits more than doubled, according to its June IPO filing. Cirrus has a backlog of over 1,400 aircraft, which will keep its Duluth manufacturing plant busy. Cirrus' success has been good for Duluth. It's one of the city's largest employers with 1,588 workers \u2014 the majority in manufacturing and engineering. This month, the company expects to complete a new $20 million innovation center at its Duluth International Airport campus, freeing up about 75,000 square feet for manufacturing. Proceeds from the IPO will be used to further bolster manufacturing; expand Cirrus' growing services business; and invest in new technology, including more automation. \"We will continue to make flying a Cirrus easier and easier,\" Nielsen said. Cirrus is the leading U.S. maker of single-engine piston planes, and its SF Vision jet \u2014 launched in 2016 \u2014 has been a hit. The company has delivered 475 jets, including 90 in 2022, its best production year yet. Jets account for about 30 % of Cirrus' sales. \"They are playing to a niche where no one else plays,\" said Brian Foley, an aviation analyst. Cirrus essentially created a market for a single-engine jet. It's slower than a twin-engine jet, but its price point is considerably lower. The Cirrus jet goes for about $3.25 million, while the next cheapest jet in the market is a twin-engine Embraer model priced at $5 million, analysts say. AVIC's ultimate ownership was crucial in developing the jet, which had been on the drawing board since the 2000s. \"Without them, the SF50 probably wouldn't have happened,\" said Bruce McClelland, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group. \"Chinese investment got [Cirrus] over the hump to launch the aircraft.\" Indeed, Chinese investment rescued Cirrus. The aviation industry tanked after the 2008 global financial meltdown and Cirrus was in deep trouble. \"They simply ran out of money, and that is how China came into play,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst. AVIC's general aviation subsidiary paid $210 million for Cirrus and got the blessing of the U.S. Treasury Department's committee on foreign investment, which reviews deals for national security concerns. But in recent years, sentiment against Chinese investment in the United States has risen. Take the recent fate of a $700 million corn mill planned for Grand Forks, N.D. The mill proposed by Fufeng Group, a privately owned Chinese company, at first won state and local government support, hailed as an economic plum. But some local citizens began protesting the mill, including its Chinese ownership. In January, the U.S. Air Force weighed in, calling the project a national security threat; the mill would have been 12 miles from the Grand Forks Air Force Base. The Fufeng deal soon died. Ironically, Cirrus has a plant in Grand Forks that is only about 17 miles from the Grand Forks Air Force Base. It employs 494 people and makes components that are assembled into airplanes in Duluth. And Cirrus' main owner AVIC \u2014 unlike Fufeng \u2014 has been on the U.S. government's growing Chinese Military Industrial Complex (CMIC) blacklist since 2020. AVIC is a sprawling aerospace concern that supplies China's military, and some of its myriad subsidiaries have publicly traded stock. U.S. investors are restricted from investing in securities of companies on the CMIC list. But the investment restriction applies specifically to AVIC subsidiaries that are also on the CMIC list. The AVIC subsidiary that owns Cirrus \u2014 China General Aviation Industry General Aircraft (CAIGA) \u2014 isn't on the list. In other words, U.S. investors could buy Cirrus stock, the IPO filing said. AVIC owns 70% of CAIGA; the other 30% is held by three state-owned Chinese investment companies. Three other subsidiaries of CAIGA have been among Cirrus' top five customers for the past few years, and two of them \u2014 AG Huanan and AG Zhejiang \u2014 have been on the U.S. \"military end user\" (MEU) list since 2020, meaning they are subject to export controls. The list applies to military-connected companies in Russia, China, Venezuela and Burma. The three related companies accounted for less than 7% of Cirrus' sales during each of the last three years. Cirrus sells aircraft kits for a version of its SR20 plane to AG Huanan. It's developing a small prop plane \u2014 the AG100 \u2014 with AG Zhejiang for the China market. The plane is aimed at training green pilots. Cirrus has the proper U.S. export clearances for both of its Chinese customers on the MEU list, the company said in its IPO filing. The AG100 agreement with AG Zhejiang allows Cirrus to market a similar plane called the SR10 in the United States. But Cirrus doesn't have the incentive to do so right now, Nielsen said. Cirrus' prop planes are already used for training. China, on the other hand, has only a tiny civil aviation industry. Its airspace is restricted. The AG100 would be used by flight schools and is aimed at training commercial pilots, Nielsen said, and it's not intended for military use. Still, the AG 100 could conceivably be used for basic military training. After all, the U.S. Air Force uses Cirrus prop planes for training. \"If you are starting from the ground up \u2014 training military pilots \u2014 you do it in planes like this,\" said aviation industry analyst McClelland. However, analysts say it's generally hard to see military uses for Cirrus' products. Cirrus is far from the only U.S. aviation business that caught China's eye. Indeed, Aboulafia noted that before U.S.-Chinese tensions rose, several prominent U.S. aerospace companies entered joint ventures with Chinese companies \u2014 including with AVIC. \"They probably wouldn't be approved today, but no one wants to kill them now,\" Aboulafia said.",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips For savvy investors, this hints at transportation giants focused on the movement of goods, especially those with tempting valuations. The post The 3 Best Transportation Stocks to Buy Now: September 2023 appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Transportation is a classic contender in the investment realm that often goes unnoticed. It might not have the glitz of newer sectors, but it stitches together over 5% of the U.S. GDP, translating to $1.3 trillion annually . For savvy investors, the search for the best transportation stocks begins here, blending tradition with tremendous potential. Moreover, even in the face of economic drizzles, some transportation companies sail smoothly, showing us their tenacity. While the broader stock market might occasionally catch a cold, those in the know are spotting golden opportunities. Among those are transportation stocks with rock-solid foundations. Furthermore, shopping sprees are set for a comeback as consumers\u2019 wanderlust for experiences settles down. For savvy investors, this hints at transportation giants focused on the movement of goods, especially those with tempting valuations. So, buckle up as we journey through three transportation stocks poised for a rewarding ride. Uber ( UBER ) Uber (NYSE: UBER ) has revved up to become the poster child of disruptive innovation. Displacing traditional taxis and pioneering the ride-sharing movement, Uber has effectively reshaped the dynamics of city transportation. But Uber didn\u2019t just stop at dropping you off at your destinations. Their progressive business plan brings food to your doorstep with Uber Eats. To go a mile further, they have revamped logistics with Uber Freight and Uber Business. The recent financial figures only underscore its relentless drive forward. Though its Q2 revenue of $9.23 billion narrowly missed projections, its net income of $394 million (or 18 cents per share) stole the show. In contrast was a staggering loss of $2.6 billion for the same quarter. It reported its first-ever quarterly operating profit of $326 million, along with a roaring free cash flow growth to $1.14 billion. This represents a near 200% bump from the prior year. Now, while it may not be rubbing shoulders with the elites in the S&P 500 just yet, the winds suggest it\u2019s prepping its grand entrance. Given its solid performances, it\u2019s undeniably one of the season\u2019s most unexpected yet delightful surprises. Canadian National Railway ( CNI ) Canadian National Railway (NYSE: CNI ) stands out as a robust pillar in the North American railroad landscape, bridging key territories across Canada and the midwestern U.S. Over the past decade, it has proven to be an excellent wealth compounder, delighting shareholders with a substantial 126% bump in its share price. It recently posted mixed earnings in its second-quarter, locking revenues at 4.06 billion CAD and grappling with an 8% drop in earnings-per-share compared to the prior year. However, the quarter was marred by a confluence of Canadian wildfires and economic ripples, viewed as transient clouds on CNI\u2019s horizon. Nevertheless, it still posted a budding 10% uptick in free cash flow, a testament to the company\u2019s resiliency. As we shift our gaze to the future, CNI holds a buoyant vision, forecasting potent growth between 10% to 15% in long-term earnings per share. Moreover, it promises 14.4% upside and a comforting 2.07% dividend yield. Boeing Co. ( BA ) Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA ), a titan in aerospace, is soaring to new heights. The aviation behemoth is renowned for its cutting-edge commercial jets and formidable defense systems. It posted an impressive Q2 revenue of $19.75 billion, eclipsing the projected $18.57 billion. This uptick can be credited to various factors, chiefly the resurgence in passenger traffic across the U.S., Europe, and Asia in the post-pandemic era. Furthermore, despite the headwinds stemming from supply chain hiccups and the recent blip around the Boeing 737 MAX, the company\u2019s trajectory remains skyward. A testament to this is the 12% jump in deliveries and a healthy 41% surge in revenues during its second-quarter. Pivoting to China, recent developments have bolstered Boeing\u2019s standing, marking a rebound from earlier setbacks. Given these indicators, Boeing\u2019s flight path looks set on a promising horizon.

It comes in three different sizes and is made with a rustic wooden frame that resembles an antique store hidden gem. Choose from seven available finishes such as retro white, natural wood, or dark brown, and lean it against your wall or mount it using the included hanging hardware. 34 These Multicolor Picture Frames for A Captivating Gallery Wall All you need for the perfect gallery wall is this collection of 10 that come in three different finishes (black, brown, and gray) for an attractive display. The frames come in three different sizes to accommodate a variety of photos and artwork and can be hung vertically or horizontally depending on your preference. Thankfully, gallery prices don\u2019t apply as this whole set will only cost you $31. 35 A Set of Outdoor String Lights to Create A Festive Atmosphere These popular have over 56,000 reviews and are a perfect way of dialing up an immediately festive ambiance for a $16 investment. It comes in lengths ranging from 25 to 100 feet with the glass bulbs designed in a chic globe shape and sporting an exposed filament. Not only are they completely dimmable, but they can also withstand all kinds of weather, making for a convivial atmosphere all year long. 36 These Turkish Hand Towels for Fashionable Functionality Just because these are stunningly beautiful, doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t also provide great functionality in the kitchen or bathroom. They\u2019re made of 100% cotton that\u2019s both soft and absorbent and which promises to dry fast without accumulating any musty odor. They come in a range of beautiful colors, all featuring a herringbone weave, and are lightweight enough to be conveniently portable. 37 A Pair of Vanity Light Fixtures to Make Your Bathroom Stand Out Make a visual impact for less than $30 with these stylish and highly rated that boast a vintage design.

Pair them with classic Edison bulbs to complete the look and mount them easily using the accompanying hardware and manual. 38 This Corkboard That Can Help You Easily Display Your Accomplishments Whether it helps you tidy up your home office, or just serves as a great place to showcase the work your kids have done in school, this versatile makes for an easy and convenient home upgrade. Available in both white and black, this board has been designed to securely hold push pins, thanks to the dense material that\u2019s underneath the cork itself. It\u2019s built to last, and is also a great option for classrooms. 39 A Shower Soap Dispenser for An Uncluttered Bath Get your body wash, shampoo, or conditioner off of the shower floor or side of the bath using this .

        "content": "Preparing for an emergency is the last thing you want to be doing during an emergency. There's never enough food, flashlights, batteries, or fuel to go around once you hear of an impending hurricane, blizzard, or wildfire, because everyone else in town is going to out fighitng over the same limited stock of items. It's better to stock up in advance and avoid the battle royal. Forget the milk and eggs. We've rounded up all the essentials for your emergency kit. Be sure to check out more guides to keep your home stocked and yourself prepared, such as How to Build a Home Tool Kit , Essentials You Need to Keep In Your Car , Best Multi-Tools , and How to Winterize Your Home . Updated September 2023: We've swapped headlamps, AM/FM radios and small stoves, as well as adding an insulated water bottle, a hammer, and a summer sleeping bag.

The Fenix E20 V2 for $45 is my top pick for an affordable emergency flashlight, but the ThruNite Archer 2A V3 for $30 is another solid choice. At 350 and 500 lumens, respectively, they're bright enough while remaining compact, and they last long on lower-light settings\u2014200 hours at 5 lumens for the Fenix and 51 hours at 17 lumens for the ThruNite. Both use two AA batteries, and in an emergency your main concern is to have a good supply of replacement batteries. If you're using alkaline batteries, remove them from the flashlight if it's going to sit unused for a long time, otherwise they'll leak and cause problems. Store them near the flashlight so you can easily find them. Try taping the batteries to the flashlight barrel. Pro tip: The best-performing flashlights are built specifically to use lithium-ion batteries or have nonremovable rechargeable batteries, which won't do you any good if the power is out for a long time. Rechargeable nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) AA batteries maintain their performance better over the lifetime of the battery, whereas alkalines\u2019 performance drops off more as they deplete, so buy some Panasonic Eneloops for $43 . They're better for the environment, but if they run out of charge you can still use regular alkaline AAs. You may prefer to keep a headlamp handy. The Black Diamond Astro 300 for $20 runs on three easily found AAA batteries and has three brightness settings, the brightest of which throws 300 lumens. That's more than powerful enough for tasks outside the home, while you can squeeze 140 hours of runtime out of the lowest setting for general tasks indoors. Coleman 4D LED Camp Lantern Coleman discontinued our previous favorite pick, the Divide+ Push Lantern, so the Coleman 4D LED Camp Lantern for $22 is the next-best choice for not a lot of coin. Flashlights do a poor job when you need to light up a whole room or if you need your hands free for a task. This basic lantern offers a single setting of 54 lumens, with a runtime of 175 hours on four D-cell batteries. That sounds like a lot, but next to other full-size battery-powered lanterns, such as the Coleman Twin LED lantern that uses eight D cells, it's economical. Fifty-four lumens is not what I'd call bright, but it is plenty bright enough for most tasks, even reading, while conserving battery life. If you want to save batteries or just prefer hanging out by gentle flickering candlelight, keep a spare emergency candle or two. The Coghlan's 36-Hour Survival Candle for $15 has three wicks that'll last for 12 hours each. Keep a lighter or some matches nearby. Lifestraw Go Water Bottle Most of the time, your water supply will work even when the power goes out. But major natural disasters can knock it out or damage it, and you might get dirty water. The LifeStraw Go Series Water Purifier Bottle for $45 marries the straw component of the LifeStraw Personal Water Filter with a BPA-free plastic bottle to filter out 99.99 percent of waterborne bacteria for up to 26 gallons of water. The original, bottle-less straw is still a good backup option for $17, and it'll filter up to 1,000 gallons. Another option is the Katadyn Steripen Adventurer for $120 , which purifies using ultraviolet light. Dunk it in your water and stir. It won\u2019t filter out sediment, but it\u2019s small, lightweight, and runs on replaceable CR123 batteries. You can also try Katadyn Micropur tablets for $16 . They're cheap and easy to store. Drop them in water and wait briefly. The taste isn\u2019t great, but no water-treatment tablets or droplets are, in my experience. If you have a large household, you may prefer something like the MSR AutoFlow XL Gravity Filter for $125 . Gravity filters take longer to purify water. You can boil water, but it won\u2019t filter out sediment, and boiling uses fuel and takes time. Coway Airmega 200M Wildfires are becoming an annual hazard, especially on the West Coast of the US, and they can spread dangerous amounts of particulate throughout the air. Homes aren't very airtight at all. Keep that toxic, carcinogenic junk out of your indoor air (and out of your lungs) by purchasing an air purifier for your home. The Coway Airmega 200M for $197 is my favorite affordable model for a small room, such as a bedroom or home office. For a larger room (up to 930 square feet), the Coway Airmega 250 for $400 is our top pick. Like the 200M, it has a smart setting that ramps up the filtering power automatically when needed; after several years of testing, both models are still going strong. Check out our Best Air Purifiers guide for more recommendations from the WIRED Gear Team. You probably already have some face masks at home, but if you don't and you live in a region susceptible to wildfires, you should pick up a box of disposable, medical-grade masks so you can breathe easier if the air becomes saturated with smoke. Fortunately, the best masks that protect against Covid-19 also protect well against smoke. We recommend the Powecom KN95 10-Pack for $12 . If these are out of stock, as many masks frequently are, check out our Best Disposable Face Masks guide. Coleman Gas Camping Stove Safety note: Don't use any of these stoves indoors. All of these fuels give off potentially deadly fumes that can accumulate and kill. Still made in the US, the classic Coleman Propane Camp Stove for $48 really hasn't changed much over the years. Propane is easy to use if you remember to stock up, and it's clean-burning. If propane is not your thing, get the Coleman Guide-Series Dual Fuel Camp Stove $198 . Camp fuel (also known as Coleman fuel and white gas) burns relatively cleanly, is easy to find for sale, and is an ideal camp stove fuel. You can also use gasoline in the Dual Fuel, but gasoline contains a lot of additives that gunk up the stove's internals, and you'll need to clean the stove out much more frequently. Get a Coleman Filtering Funnel for $11 if you purchase a liquid-fuel stove. The Sterno Outdoor Folding Camp Stove for $14 folds up so small that it's an easy option for people without room to keep a full-size stove around. It's an inexpensive backup that's handy to have, even if you've got a nice camp stove or a backpacking stove like an MSR Pocket Rocket for $85 . Our previous pick, the Jetboil Zip for $95 , is a fine stove for making single-serve hot drinks and soupy meals, but with the MSR you can use your regular cookware to make multiperson meals. It's not as fancy as the Colemans, but it's a lot easier to store in a crowded apartment. Make sure you grab an MSR IsoPro Fuel Canister for $11 . This large, 16-ounce size is best, in case the emergency lasts for several days. GSI Outdoors Pioneer Table Set Your regular cooking utensils, eating utensils, and metal, plastic, and wooden cookware can all be used during an emergency, but glass or ceramic drinking glasses and plates are a different case, as they can shatter. It'll be tough cleaning up the pieces with no power. When the lights go out, switch to this enameled steel dishware, such as the GSI Outdoors Pioneer Table Set for $130 . If somebody drops a piece, no big deal. Assuming your home's water supply is still working (and clean), the water will come out of the pipes somewhat cooler than the ambient air temperature. Having an insulated bottle will help conserve that precious coolness if you don't like drinking room-temperature water. The Klean Kanteen Insulated Classic for $34 is much easier to find for sale than the Miir\u2014the top pick in our Best Reusable Water Bottles guide\u2014and I found it remarkably durable. For more drinkware, check out our Best Insulated Travel Mugs guide. Stock up on items that don't require refrigeration and have long shelf lives. Rather than making a grocery run for eggs and milk, pick up foods such as instant rice, dried fruit, and oatmeal. If you don't have room for a camp stove or live in a busy city where it may be tough to cook outside when the power goes out, or if you just don't like to cook, pick up a Mountain House 3-Day Adventure Dehydrated Meal Kit for $105 . All you need to do is add water. If the power does go out, keep your refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible, to keep the stuff inside fresh for as long as possible. Leatherman Wave Plus For small jobs, a good do-it-all multi-tool such as the Leatherman Wave Plus for $120 is a lifesaver. When the lights are out and there's emergency gear spread out all over the home, it's especially annoying to keep going out to the garage to retrieve one tool after another. Carry them all in one tool in your pocket and cut the number of trips way down. If you only need a knife, the made-in-France Opinel No. 8 folding knife for $19 is an excellent choice. For such little money, the stainless steel blade\u2014which can be locked open or closed\u2014is remarkably sharp and well-shaped. Because it's so light, I often take it hiking instead of a chunkier knife. You may have to board up windows. Nails have increased sheer strength (that is, strength against forces perpendicular to the head). You'll need a good hammer. Since the slightly more affordable Plumb we recommend in my How to Build a Home Tool Kit guide is sold out, you may as well step up to my favorite hammer, the Vaughan 20-ounce Smooth Face Hickory-Handle Hammer, for $27 . Forget metal-handled hammers. They transit a lot of striking force to your hand through the handle. Fiberglass or wood is more forgiving. Pick up a pound or two of common nails while you're at it. You may need to repair items around the home, too, so it wouldn't hurt to have a good drill handy. The DeWalt 20V Max 1/2-Inch Cordless Drill for $99 is my favorite drill, and the best deal in cordless drills on the market. I recommend it for all homeowners, but it comes especially in handy when you have a lot of screws to drive in a hurry. A DeWalt 14-piece Screw Bit Set for $11 is a solid, affordable set of drill bits to use with your drill. It's difficult for most people to store a bunch of spare lumber in case of an emergency\u2014you'll just have to go to the hardware store to stock up at the earliest sign of trouble\u2014but it's easy to go ahead and store a big box of general purpose screws. Some 2-inch wood screws should do the trick. Make sure they're wood screws, which are designed specifically to go into wood. Some odds and ends will come in handy, too. Always keep a roll of duct tape for $8 handy, and a screwdriver in case your cordless drill runs out of power and you're unable to recharge it. A Channellock 6-in-1 Screwdriver for $8 has the main screwdriver bit sizes, both flathead and Phillips, and keeps everything compact by storing the bits inside itself. Mosey on over to our article How to Put Together a Home Tool Kit and our guide to the Best Multi-Tools for most information on preparing your home for natural disasters. Coleman Quick Bed Single High Airbed Mattress You'll need more beds if other folks stay with you during an emergency. Generally, I hate how inflatable mattresses deflate under my body weight by the early morning hours. The only exceptions I've found are Coleman mattresses, which have air nozzles designed to seal tighter when bodyweight is on top of the mattress. When I used the Quick Bed Single High Mattress Queen-Size for $53 last, I slept three nights before having to top it off with more air. Pick up a manual air pump if you don't already have a bicycle or sports pump. There's also the Coleman Pack-Away Camping Cot for $76 . Unlike most cots, this one doesn't have horizontal bars across the head and foot ends. Bars like that are evil. I've whacked my head and ankles on them enough for two lifetimes. You can use a rectangular sleeping bag (instead of a mummy bag) so that you have more room to stretch out. The Coleman Brazos 30 Sleeping Bag for $47 and Alps Mountaineering Crescent Lake 20F Sleeping Bag for $55 are solid options that won't break the bank. For warmer seasons when you might need something during cool nights, the Marmot NanoWave 55 Sleeping Bag for $79 is a personal favorite. It's rated to 55 degrees Fahrenheight and is just roomy enough not to feel constricting while also packing down into the size of a water bottle. Keep in mind that temperature ratings on sleeping bags are often overly optimistic, especially for women, who tend to sleep colder than men. Anker Portable Charger Anker makes my favorite power banks, which I use when traveling and during power outages to keep my phone topped off. That's important during emergencies for communicating with people. You can get by for days with a slim model like the Anker PowerCore Slim 10,000-mAh Portable Charger for $24 , but if you know you'll be on your phone much more or using an iPad, steer toward the PowerCore 26,800-mAh for $26 . Remember to check it periodically, pre-emergency, to keep it fully charged. Read our Best Portable Chargers guide for more. If you'd like to plan for longer emergencies, in situations where you may run down a battery bank before the power comes back on, consider the Powerfilm Solar Lightsaver for $200 . Barely the size of a small flashlight when rolled up, this compact solar panel charges fully in only six hours. Once it's charged, connect it via a USB cable to whichever device needs extra juice. It can also double as a standard battery bank if you charge it via a wall outlet, which takes about three hours with the included micro USB cable. You'll also want a portable radio, such as the Sony Portable AM/FM Radio for $40 , to hear weather reports and emergency broadcasts. Even if you don't ordinarily listen to terrestrial radio, you should have one and not rely on your phone. As with your flashlight, take the batteries out and store them with the radio. Fjallraven jacket Make sure you\u2019ve got warm clothing to wear indoors if the power goes out. The Uniqlo Fluffy Yarn Fleece Jacket ( men , women ) for $40 and REI Co-Op 650 Down Jacket 2.0 ( men , women ) for $100 are insanely warm, as are Uniqlo\u2019s Heattech long john tops ( men , women ) for $30 and bottoms ( men , women ) for $30 . If you end up outside cutting up trees and fixing busted fences after a disaster, you might not want to get your regular jacket torn up or muddy. My Carharrt Duck Sherpa-Lined Coat for $130 is very warm and very tough; I\u2019ve subjected it to all kinds of abuse. There's a similarly tough Carharrt Duck Sherpa-Lined Coat in women's sizing for $130 . Fjallraven is another tough outerwear brand that makes jackets we like. While you\u2019re at it, check out our gift guide for people who're always cold . Don\u2019t forget a cozy blanket, such as the L.L.Bean Wicked Plush Throw for $30 , and keep your feet warm with Glerups' Wool Slippers for $100 and Darn Tough wool socks for $23 . They're expensive, but they\u2019ve kept my feet warm through a few disasters. Hario Skerton Pro. Mr. Coffee and Keurig don't work when the power's out, but you'll still want your morning cup of joe. I'm one of WIRED's many coffee-worshiping zealots, and my favorite coffee grinder is the manual Hario Skerton Pro for $51 . Its base is made of thick glass that's survived more than a few drops onto my hardwood floor, and you can adjust the grind size to be suitable for anything from espresso to French press. For pour-overs, the ceramic Hario V60 Size 02 for $21 is perfect for making a big cup for one person at a time. If you do pour-over, you'll need to keep coffee filters for $6 around, and you'll need a gooseneck kettle to control the pour. The best stovetop one I've used is the Hario V60 Jino Gooseneck Kettle for $44. For French press, the Frieling 23-Ounce for $120 is my pick. It's double-wall insulated, so you won't burn your hands, and it's big enough to make a couple of big cups of coffee at a time. The AeroPress for $40 also comes highly recommended by another WIRED coffee addict. Check out our Best Insulated Travel Mugs and Best Portable Coffee Makers guides for more. Luggable Loo Your shower is likely to work just fine, but the Simple Shower Gravity Shower Kit for $12 is an inexpensive, compact backup if your home loses its supply of clean tap water. This kit screws onto a common soda bottle. Hang it upside down and it'll feed water onto the bather. You can use it anywhere, but you may as well set it up in your regular shower. If you hang it off the showerhead pipe, just make sure the weight won't tear it out of the wall or bend it. This product tends to go in and out of stock, so if it's currently unavailable, just keep an eye on the product page. Toilets usually will still flush fine in an emergency, and if they stop refilling you can flush a toilet by pouring water into the back tank (not the bowl). If your home's water supply is broken for days, eventually you'll need somewhere else to go. Buy a Luggable Loo Toilet Seat Lid for $16 and a 5-Gallon Bucket for $5 to construct a makeshift toilet. Don't forget waste bags for $14 to line the bucket. Keep a bag of kitty litter nearby, along with a cheap trowel for $6 for scooping it into the bucket after each use, extra toilet paper, and hand sanitizer. Champion Dual Fuel 3650-Watt Most of the time, you can get by without a generator and manage to stay warm, cook, and keep some lights on. You have to maintain generators, make sure you store enough fuel, and empty their tanks before they sit unused for a long time\u2014or use a fuel stabilizer for $9 . If you need a generator for medical equipment or think the luxury is worth the hassle, Honda makes excellent ones; Briggs & Stratton motors are solid too. But honestly, if you have to buy a big, hulking generator that\u2019ll sit unused most of the time, and you\u2019re watching your pennies, you can get by with a cheap one such as the Champion Dual Fuel 3650-Watt for $575 . Pro tip: Change the spark plug to a brand-name one as soon as you bring it home. The stock spark plugs that come with these Chinese generators tend to be junk. Just remember that gasoline spoils relatively quickly, needs to be prepared for inactivity with fuel stabilizers, and must be drained after a year. This is why, for most people, a generator isn't worth it (especially if you follow the rest of this guide). You should keep some spare gas around, as well. Whether you need it for your generator or your car, buy a fuel can that's made specifically for storing fuel safely. The Garage Boss Press N Pour for $28 will hold 5 gallons of gasoline and comes with a safety nozzle that only releases fuel when the spout is pressed to the gas tank opening. Just remember that cans are typically color-coded to the types of fuel they hold, in order to reduce the chance of costly or dangerous mix-ups. Gasoline goes in red canisters, and diesel goes in yellow . You probably have most of the medical essentials such as bandages and ibuprofen, but you should have a more robust medical kit for emergencies. Check out my guide on How to Make a First Aid Kit . It'll tell you how to build a bomber kit for less money than the storebought versions. If that sounds like a daunting task, the Adventure Medical Kits Mountain Series Explorer Medical Kit for $70 will cover the bases.. They also make medical kits that include directions for pets and their humans for $57 . If someone gets hurt badly, you might not be able to get to a hospital right away. It's a good idea to learn some first aid. You can take NOLS Wilderness First Aid courses through REI. From my experiences over the past four years, NOLS has fantastic instructors and a thorough hands-on curriculum. Natural disasters can be pretty boring during the non-panicky parts. Power outages involve lots of sitting around, so pick up a card game or a board game to play. I recommend Exploding Kittens for $20 to soothe everybody's nerves\u2014or aggravate them in an entertaining manner. It also has no small pieces to lose in the dark. For board games, check out one of our favorites: Ticket to Ride for $48 . Check out more of WIRED's Favorite Board Games for ways to pass the time during trying times. Finally, you should read WIRED senior associate reviews editor Adrienne So's article on why the best emergency gear is other people . Having a network of people to communicate with and who will check in on you is incredibly important.",

One simple ratio can guide your investment strategy in precious metals today. The post Gold vs. Silver: Which Precious Metal Should You Invest in Now? appeared first on InvestorPlace. More From InvestorPlace ChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires. Here\u2019s How to Get In. The Rich Use This Income Secret (NOT Dividends) Far More Than Regular Investors",
        "content": "I\u2019ve made the argument here recently that gold prices have a real chance of breaking out of their multi-year range on a potential credit event. But where does that mean for silver, which is often referred to as \u201cpoor man\u2019s gold?\u201d One thing you can look at is a simple price ratio of silver to gold. This ratio can provide crucial insights into the relative value of these two metals and help guide your investment strategy. The silver-to-gold ratio is a simple concept that measures the relative value of silver to gold. You can calculate it by dividing the current price of silver by the price of gold. In essence, this ratio tells you how many ounces of gold it would take to purchase one ounce of silver at current market prices. The silver-to-gold ratio is more than just a mathematical calculation; it\u2019s a tool that can inform your investment strategy. It also has some interesting implications on expectations for economic activity. Gold is more of a risk-off asset, whereas silver more a signal of industrial global demand and output. Should You Buy Silver or Gold? If we look at two ETFs as proxies, iShares Silver Trust (NYSEARCA: SLV ) for silver and SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA: GLD ) for gold, we can see that for the last decade, silver has underperformed gold. Silver prices have been in a tight range all year. When the ratio is high (above the historical average), it suggests that silver is overvalued relative to gold. This could be an indication that it\u2019s a good time to buy gold or sell silver. Conversely, when the ratio is low (below the historical average), it may indicate that silver is undervalued relative to gold, suggesting an opportune time to buy silver or sell gold. From a technical standpoint, it looks like the ratio is right at the midpoint, meaning it\u2019s unclear which outperforms which here. Regardless, the two are co-moving here and could continue to do so as demand for precious metal diversification increases. So, do you buy silver or gold? I think there\u2019s a case for both here, although I lean more towards gold. Keep in mind that investors often see precious metals like gold and silver as hedges against inflation. If inflation expectations are high, both metals may see price increases, but the impact on the silver-to-gold ratio would depend on the relative price changes. The Bottom Line The bottom line here is simple. The silver-to-gold ratio offers valuable insights for those investing in these precious metals. It can serve as a guide for allocating resources between gold and silver and help identify potential investment opportunities. Silver has underperformed gold for a decade, and gold could outpace silver pushing the ratio lower on a flight-to-safety sequence in the yellow metal. This however still likely means silver does well, although it would underperform on a relative basis. I think, broadly speaking, diversifying in precious metals makes sense given where we are in the cycle, and some big movements could be on the horizon.

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Airport parking lots are common targets for thieves looking to steal catalytic converters. getty Airports, not surprisingly, are a common place targeted by car thieves, who have their pick of vehicles or get underneath cars and saw off valuable catalytic converters. Should the latter happen, you\u2019ll know as soon you start to drive off and you hear a loud roaring sound. When a car is parked at the airport, it\u2019s left for a long time, and there\u2019s a low chance that the owner will return and catch the thief in the act, explains Rick Musson, a 21-year law enforcement officer and q safety and security consultant with CarInsuranceComparison.com . Even more: \u201cThieves appreciate the lower risk of immediate theft discovery,\u201d Musson says. \u201cThe longer a thief has to move a stolen car, the less chance they\u2019ll be caught.\u201d Nationally, catalytic converter thefts have been on the rise, increasing by 1,215% between 2019 and 2022, according to National Insurance Crime Bureau Statistics. Airport parking lots are hot spots for this category of theft because they give thieves access to several cars all at once, so they can remove multiple catalytic converters in a spree, Musson says. Read on to learn how to prevent your car, and its catalytic converter, from being stolen from parking lots while you\u2019re out of town. MORE FOR YOU Ukrainian Brigades Were Advancing. Then They Ran Low On Bridgelayers. That 70s Show Star Danny Masterson Sentenced To 30 Years To Life For Rape Diarrhea All The Way Through Airplane Forces Delta Flight To Do U Turn How Are Airports Preventing Catalytic Converter and Car Theft? Airports across the country are stepping up security to prevent car and catalytic converter thefts from their lots. In Colorado, a leading state for car thefts, 378 vehicles were reported stolen from parking lots at Denver International Airport in the six-month period between Jan. 1 and July 31. To put things in perspective, more than 7 million vehicles parked in the airport\u2019s 51,000 spaces during that time period\u2014so chances are quite slim your car will be stolen. Still, the Common Sense Institute says that in 2022, the thieves stole more motor vehicles from Denver International Airport than any other single location in Colorado. Airport officials at DIA in July announced several measures to prevent theft, including beefing up its patrol in the airports by contracting with security personnel and the city\u2019s police department and adding 15 High Activity Location Observation (or HALO) security cameras to collect video footage of potential crimes. The airport also says it has technology to alert security should a stolen vehicle enter one of its parking lots. How to Prevent Your Car from Being Stolen at an Airport Parking Lot? To avoid having your car stolen, try to park in the premium lots that come with security monitoring, Musson suggests. You should also park in a lighted area, avoid keeping any valuables in your car, and, if you have GPS monitoring in your vehicle, make sure you set an alert so you know if your vehicle moves, he says. Steering wheel locks and car alarms can also be deterrents. Why Do People Steal Catalytic Converters? Stolen catalytic converters can fetch between $20 to $350 on the black market, but the replacement costs, should you have one stolen, a catalytic converter price averages more than $2,500, according to the National Automotive Dealers Association. But the reason people steal catalytic converters isn\u2019t to re-sell them, necessarily. About the size of a loaf of bread, catalytic converters are a critical emissions control device. Thieves are interested in catalytic converters because they contain precious metals like palladium and platinum, which can fetch high dollar amounts on the black market, explains Patryk Doornebos, who runs CarTriple.com , an automotive blog. Unfortunately, stealing a catalytic converter can be done in mere minutes, making it a lucrative and relatively low-risk activity for thieves, he says. Thieves can get under cars and steal catalytic converters quicklyl. getty \u201cAs for catalytic converter theft, vehicles with higher ground clearance, including trucks like the Ford F-150 or Chevrolet Silverado, are often targeted because of the easier access underneath,\u201d Doornebos says. \u201cHybrids like the Toyota Prius are also susceptible since their converters tend to have higher amounts of precious metals.\u201d A catalytic converter replacement can be a hassle because it can be tough to track down the part, especially in the event of a local crime spree when several other vehicle owners are making the same repairs.

        "content": "Money in the Bank \u201cI lined up a new gig for you,\u201d said the Glovemaster. \u201cAll you have to do is protect one special guy.\u201d I sat in my trailer with my Bluetooth headphones on and my laptop perched on an Amazon box. I wore a boonie hat with a militia logo, Oakley mirrorshades, a shoulder-holster, and a miracle-fabric tactical T-shirt. I was every inch Lieutenant Colonel Wayne Osborne of the Delta Force. \u201cI won\u2019t do any bodyguard work out of town,\u201d I told the screen. \u201cIf I abandon my wife, she\u2019ll file for divorce.\u201d \u201cYour wife is your excuse for everything,\u201d said the Glovemaster. On my Zoom screen, he presented as the evil animated glove creature from the Beatles movie . IRL, the Glovemaster was a high-school hacker kid from Jersey born forty years after the Beatles broke up. I knew who he was because he still lived with his parents, who didn\u2019t know a damn thing about computer security. But the kid understood blockchain technology and he knew how to scam. And I needed his money. Not dollars\u2014never, ever, crappy government fiat money controlled by the banksters. I needed hard, proven, decentralized Internet money. This was my guarantee of financial freedom, so that someday I could keep all my promises to Jacqui. \u201cNever let your woman tie you down, bro,\u201d growled the Glovemaster. \u201cYou get your cold-wallet storage. Get your bugout bag. Get your handguns. Then you launch into action.\u201d He was telling me this from his parents\u2019 basement in Trenton. But the dude had made me rich once. It wasn\u2019t his fault that I\u2019d misplaced my cartoon ape. For Jacqui\u2019s sake I\u2019d convinced the crypto world that I was a heavily-armed J6 militia veteran. \u201cLieutenant Colonel Wayne Osborne\u201d was a two-fisted Afghan vet with five tours under his belt, an enforcer and kneecapper, the last man in the world you would ever want to cross. It had taken me three years of boning up on Second Amendment gun show talk and mall-ninja cyberwar jargon to build my tough-guy rep in crypto-land. But I was motivated. Because when a soldier finally comes home from overseas and sees the girl next door again\u2014well, you may not understand this, but I just had to have some of that. I just had to\u2014because that was who I was. And Jacqui was sweet about it. A decent church wedding, a house, and a baby, that was all she asked from me. I made my vows to her in the sight of God and man. Those were my core values. The rest\u2014that was just my necessary hustle in a troubled and treacherous world. I understood crypto. I knew plenty about air-gapping, public keys, block rewards, Know-Your-Customer rules, and all the good ways to ignore them. But still no white picket fence for my Jacqui. Not for any price an honest man could pay. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about your new client,\u201d said the big blue cartoon glove. \u201cHe\u2019s a Bitcoin one-percenter. He could buy a Trump Tower with his leftover Ethereum. If crypto is here to change the world, then the Mealybug is the change.\u201d \u201cSo, the Mealybug is your favorite whale now, eh?\u201d \u201cYes, he is. I\u2019m on the Mealybug\u2019s secret Discord. You know who turned me on to that? Pavel Marco himself!\u201d The Glovemaster always hacker-bragged about his connections\u2014but he could make it rain, too. \u201cAll right,\u201d I said, \u201cyour esteemed financial backer there, your oligarch with the yacht\u2014what\u2019s his problem?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s been doxxed.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d Better him than me, though. The real Lieutenant Colonel Wayne Osborne had been killed by a car-bomb in Iraq back in 2013. Not my name, not my rank, not my serial number. \u201cHis enemies found out who the Mealybug is, and where he is, and where he came from, and why he got that name. So he\u2019s got trolls and stalkers all over him now. He\u2019s on the run, he needs professional help. Lucky for him, I know a real operator\u2014you.\u201d I shrugged, and adjusted my holster. \u201cNothing new about a shakedown racket.\u201d \u201cEvery whale makes enemies,\u201d said the glove. \u201cThose no-coiners, they all hate success.\u201d \u201cSo, what kind of enemies does a Mealybug have? Russian spies, Jewish bankers? The Illuminati?\u201d \u201cCould be all three.\u201d \u201cIs he American? Maybe betrayed by some fed informant, feminazis, deep-staters, cultural Marxists?\u201d Ex-Delta Force Wayne Osborne always had a ready list of threat-actors. \u201cThat\u2019s for you to find out, Colonel. You\u2019re the ideal man for this job. How about a three-day weekend in Las Vegas?\u201d \u201cThen it\u2019s the Mob,\u201d I concluded. \u201cThe Cosa Nostra. Your Mealybug\u2019s a high-roller.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not saying what he is or what he isn\u2019t. I\u2019m saying he\u2019s my favorite whale. Do you live anywhere near the U.S. Mountain timezone?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not saying that I do or I don\u2019t. What does this job pay me?\u201d \u201cA true whale doesn\u2019t have to pay. I can tell you the exact date and time of his next big market move in Ethereum. When you surf in the wake of a big whale\u2014market up, market down, makes no difference. You\u2019ll make out like a bandit either way, and best of all, there\u2019s no paper trail.\u201d This hot tip was supposed to impress me, but I\u2019d been burned on Ethereum market moves so many times that I couldn\u2019t buy the dip\u2014I had no dip left. The Glovemaster sketched out the situation for me. In Vegas, the Mealybug was cowering in some penthouse. He was so scared that he never moved in the daylight. Only active after dark, terrified of paparazzi, stalkers, security cameras, bad guys who might curb-stomp him, put his feet in cement, dump him into what was left of Lake Meade. This yarn sounded like paranoid Howard Hughes bullshit, and it suddenly struck me that I didn\u2019t believe in the Mealybug. Sure, I believed in whales. I totally believed in Bitcoin. But when it came to a billionaire so scared he would throw Bitcoin at strangers, I just wasn\u2019t buying the pitch. Still, if I didn\u2019t believe in the Mealybug, I believed even less in his so-called \u201cenemies.\u201d \u201cShow me the color of his money.\u201d Jacqui and me, and the house . . . our story was epic. Epic failure. We\u2019d flown so high together, once. At market peak, I was ready to sign the dotted line for a 4500-square-foot house in a gated development. But I lost the down payment in a big Dogecoin dip. I stayed out of Dogecoin after that, no matter what Elon Musk said. No Tesla for me, either. Now Jacqui lived with me in a trailer park where I had to chain the hood on my pickup so the neighbors wouldn\u2019t steal my catalytic converter. Also, the pickup was iffy about running. I used a bike. The Mealybug\u2019s first payoff arrived in an Amazon Prime package at my favorite anonymous mail drop. The box was full of mush, half wax and half golden flakes, like cornflakes of precious metal gnawed off an asteroid. The coinage a hive of ants might use if ants were astronauts. I cycled over to Duke\u2019s Pawnshop, Duke being the guy in possession of some awesome techie gear I\u2019d bought when I was prosperous. I showed him a spoonful of the goo from the package. Duke used his x-ray fluorescence machine on it. It rated out at 22 Karat. I redeemed my favorite Internet-of-Things 5G router and took it back to the trailer. Jacqui caught me there with the rest of the loot, because there are no secrets in a trailer. She was wearing cut offs and a tank top and carrying a bag of canned goods. She saw my 5G router. \u201cI thought you sold that. How did you get it back?\u201d Then she saw the Prime package. \u201cYou\u2019re ordering from Amazon again! Did you get me something?\u201d I showed her the golden mush. She wrinkled her nose. \u201cWhat in the sacred name of Jesus?\u201d \u201cThis is gold, honey,\u201d I told her. \u201cI figure four ounces, which at today\u2019s spot price would be about two Ether.\u201d \u201cYou said Bitcoin was much sounder than Ether.\u201d \u201cIt is. This is just a retainer. I\u2019ve got to go to Vegas right away. To consult with a big-time coin guy.\u201d That brought a furrow to her brow. \u201cYou\u2019re going to cheat on me. You\u2019re going to Vegas so you can cheat on me.\u201d \u201cBaby, why do you say that? I want you to have everything you want, every single thing I promised! When you\u2019re happy, I\u2019m happy.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re totally in debt! We live in a tin box! What if we get sick? We have no health insurance.\u201d \u201cBaby, that\u2019s true, we\u2019re hard up now, but what if we hit it rich again? This is real gold! We struck gold, okay? It\u2019s not stupid government fiat that\u2019s owned by our deep-state oppressors. Even in the Bible, gold is wealth, and I can get us more, too.\u201d \u201cSure. You\u2019re gonna find gold in Las Vegas.\u201d Her scorn stung me. \u201cJacqui, precious, come with me! Why not? Let\u2019s go together. To Vegas! There are nice hotels, the food\u2019s great. It\u2019s a number one American holiday destination.\u201d She was still so darkly suspicious\u2014a terrible thing to see, because, before I\u2019d swept Jacqui off her feet, she\u2019d never looked like that. She wasn\u2019t even thirty and had worry lines in her face. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to come. To keep you out of girl-trouble.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Vegas! It\u2019s nice!\u201d I pulled her onto my lap. \u201cAlso, I can get you some cocaine.\u201d While Jacqui and I were on the plane to Vegas\u2014wearing some Democrat plague masks, a big drag\u2014I skimmed the basics about mealybugs on Google. It turned out that my client was named after a soft-bodied scale insect. A slow-moving arthropod, with weak legs, mostly covered with a white, waxy, cotton-like exudation. Mealybugs cling to the softest, wettest parts of plants, wedging themselves in leaf folds, stem crotches, or other tight locations. They suck juice out of the plant veins and distill it into a honeydew. In exchange for the golden dew, certain ants choose to protect the mealybug. The Mealybug was so rich he could afford to hire the likes of Pavel Marco, the toughest blackhat mercenary out of Mogadishu. But it seemed that old-school Pavel couldn\u2019t keep up with the latest developments in cyberwar. The Mealybug was nervous about his new horde of online enemies. So the Glovemaster had recommended me. I pinged a few satoshi into the Mealybug\u2019s Bitcoin account, so he\u2019d know that I was a player, and that I was around and alert. When we reached the Vegas hotel, I invented more noise to demonstrate my protective services. Government-approved \u201cprivate detectives\u201d and \u201cprivate security services\u201d\u2014they have their exams and licenses, and all that crap. That\u2019s gatekeeping meant to distract the sheeple from the power of peer-to-peer, decentralized, distributed knowledge. I didn\u2019t need a stinkin\u2019 badge. Crypto is a private banking system, and I was a private bank guard\u2014that was easy. Also\u2014and this was the best part\u2014I didn\u2019t have to really protect the Mealybug. The odds were ninety-nine out of a hundred that his enemies were all imaginary. My client was some gold-bug wedged into the top-floor of a Vegas casino, chewing on his own froth. How could anybody hurt him way up there? Vegas casinos are super-secure buildings. They\u2019re run by American mobsters who have seen every kind of crook on Planet Earth. I cooked up some fake TikTok video snippets of a bodyguard on patrol\u2014mean streets of Vegas, bulletproof vest, Heckler & Koch MP5. Open-source video clips. \u201cFake news\u201d to make me look good. In this case, lots of Vegas thriller stuff, like from . I\u2019d watched about a million thriller flicks while I was bored to death on duty as a telecommunications sergeant at an Army base in Kuwait. I leaked those videos in Twitter DMs. Not to boast about my hacker chops here, but whenever \u201cColonel Osborne\u201d looked on the prowl, hard and heavy-duty, people were plenty scared of him. To stay on my good side, the bros passed me lots of useful hints about the coin biz. Market positions running up and collapsing. Ground-floor recommendations about the next big thing in non-fungible tokens. I placed a few bets on the \u201cBathtub Babes\u201d NFT series. Then my own bathtub babe came out of our steamy bathroom wrapped in hotel-branded Turkish towels. She turned on the hotel TV, which had an erotic cable feed fit to make the Chinese, Russians, and Arabs eager to pick up Vegas showgirls. \u201cOh my goodness! None of this for you, bad boy! Let\u2019s go out and play.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t go out, babe. I have work to do.\u201d \u201cWell then, until you\u2019re done, I\u2019ll check out my Opensea wallet. Let\u2019s see how my art is doing.\u201d She put her Macbook on the hotel table, opposite from my PC. Jacqui liked to buy art in the big NFT gallery markets, where she always lost money. She only bought art that was pretty, as opposed to the genuinely profitable NFT artworks, which were ugly squiggles, or crude 8-bit cartoons, or mutant monkeys. Still, her can-do attitude was so endearing, especially after all we\u2019d been through. I worried. We were in Vegas, which felt good, but soon we\u2019d be stuck back in our trailer, and then what? To Jacqui, I was never Lieutenant Colonel Wayne Osborne of the Delta Force. I was her husband, the big kid next door, Mike Luftschager. Back to that poorhouse, back to scowls and scoldings. I couldn\u2019t let Wayne Osborne lose her. I left the screen, rummaged in my suitcase until I found the Altoids box, popped it open, and scooped a good helping of coke onto the suite\u2019s glass-topped coffee table. I opened the deck of Aviators that came with the room and used the ace of spades to draw the coke into lines, rolled up a twenty, and held it out to her. \u201cYou first, sweetie.\u201d She stood there for a moment, then relented. \u201cYou do still love me, don\u2019t you.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s live a little, for once. We deserve it. Why can\u2019t we be happy, have fun? Let\u2019s go have fun.\u201d She snorted a line. Her eyes brightened. \u201cNow you.\u201d There was an edge to her voice, and I didn\u2019t need to push that. I did a line. Suddenly I felt a change of attitude. Sure, the odds were steep, but hadn\u2019t I worked hard for success? If I got a lucky break, why fret about that, and fear the worst like some loser? Were rich crypto speculators cowards? Just the Mealybug, it seemed. Jacqui went downstairs with me and we hit the slots. We didn\u2019t lose all that much, and thanks to the coke we forgot to eat. While she lay on the hotel bed, drowsily flipping through celebrity Instagrams, I managed my website for Colonel Osborne\u2014\u201cBlack Diamond Security.\u201d I\u2019d modeled my site on the website for Pavel Marco, spooky and enigmatic, because tough minded men-of-action with international connections played it close to the vest. Everything token-gated. Jacqui had passed out, phone in hand, but Vegas was still alive and rollicking, because, night-time in Vegas. Due to the coke, I felt a restless urge to \u201ccase the joint\u201d over at the Mealybug\u2019s tower hotel. I put on a cheap straw hat and a plague mask, because Vegas has a shitload of smart security cams. I gazed up at the glowing purple walls of the almighty Imperial Palace, where the Mealybug had a suite paid for by \u201cHemiptera Hemimetabolous,\u201d some Greek millionaire. Down on the street were clusters of Midwest tourist hicks looking much dumber and drunker than me. I decided to try the lobby. Crossing the street, I was almost run down by a Volkswagen Beetle. I hopped from the dusty gutter as it sped past my bootheels. Silently. No Volkswagen engine noise. Then another Beetle, red, one of those humpy old-fashioned shapes favored by Adolf Hitler, sliding along blind and silent, only this one was circling the Imperial Palace in the opposite direction. Thirty seconds later, two more\u2014big red bugs meeting quiet as spiders at a Vegas traffic light, then turning opposite directions. Another beetle waited under the hotel portico, discreet, lurking. Nothing human got in or out of it. The hotel valets, who should have been all over it, ignored it. I sidled over, bent down, and cupped my hands against the dark window. No driver in there\u2014not even a steering wheel. \u201cMay I help you, sir?\u201d said a valet, and if I was a big bruiser, he was bigger. \u201cOne of these robot cars almost hit me.\u201d \u201cSelf-driving units, sir, over from the Tesla Factory in Reno. Experimental models. Sometimes eight, sometimes ten. Maybe more. I\u2019d watch my step, sir.\u201d I made myself scarce, then pulled my Android burner phone. No location tracking. I called the Imperial Palace operator, got a polite and too-talkative chatbot. The talking bot had never heard of any Imperial guest called Hemimetabolous\u2014it just blandly denied reality. I sent the Glovemaster an URGENT!!! text message. While I waited I cased the hotel\u2019s garbage bins\u2014an old hacker trick, especially good for buildings where they beat you up if you try to sneak in. Under the long rubber lid, I found lots of throwaway casino-kitchen garbage, some thick waxy froth, and some long empty husks. The Glovemaster called me up at the number I had just sent. \u201cColonel, I said I would get you a job in Vegas. I didn\u2019t say you could drag me into some mafia scene. The Mealybug\u2019s hotel has to be mobbed up. Why do you want to get past their security?\u201d \u201cGlovemaster, do you want your whale alive, or do you want him rendered for blubber? I\u2019m on patrol outside his hotel right now. There are freakin\u2019 car-bombs rolling around down here. Iraq-style Improvised Explosive Devices. There\u2019s enough firepower down here to blow your Mealybug to smithereens and burn every living thing in this building.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re on the level?\u201d \u201cSure as my name is Wayne Osborne.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t wanna do this,\u201d mourned Glovemaster, \u201cbut I guess I\u2019d better.\u201d At three-fifteen AM a black chopper lofted from the top of the Imperial Palace. The high-rollers appreciate a helipad. Arab Princes. Deep State guys. Members of the Trump clan. I\u2019d done my good deed for the day. Maybe the best deed of my career, if the rich whale was feeling generous. Back to our hotel. People go to Vegas to get divorced, but Jacqui was out of her divorcing mood. My nerves were shot from pulling a freak-out late-nighter, but while I stayed in bed, she rose bright and chipper and went out to \u201cdo Vegas.\u201d When she returned I was showered and having a room-service breakfast\u2014darn good breakfast too, a stack of Belgian waffles, two scrambled eggs, and a generous rasher of applewood-smoked bacon, all of that chow for under twenty bucks US fiat. \u201cI love Vegas, Mike,\u201d she said, dropping laden shopping bags. \u201cRemember, sweetie\u2014call me Wayne when I\u2019m working.\u201d \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re working.\u201d I decided it was better if I didn\u2019t respond to that. \u201cMaybe we could start over right here,\u201d Jacqui said, \u201cand never go back to that cheesebox in Boulder.\u201d \u201cA lot of people start over in Vegas. It\u2019s an adventure.\u201d She flopped down on the bed and leaned her head on her hand. \u201cPeople are so friendly here. I met such a nice old lady, she says I could be an exotic dancer. She used to be an exotic dancer, before she did casino security. Maybe I could be an exotic dancer, too, make a lot of money, help pay for things. She says I have the looks for it.\u201d Jacqui wasn\u2019t the Vegas showgirl type, because she looked girl-next-door, but if she was talking about the fun she\u2019d had, then I didn\u2019t have to talk about what Wayne Osborne had been doing all night. Because I wasn\u2019t gonna mention that, and that was gonna look suspicious. \u201cWhat happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,\u201d I said. Jacqui laughed at that, the way she used to laugh. Then I felt so much better that I thought, maybe she\u2019s right. Maybe Vegas life is the right life for us. I don\u2019t have to be Wayne Osborne. I could get a quiet casino security job and spend all night watching a bank of video monitors, just like I\u2019d spent years in uniform hunched over screens in Kuwait. Then I thought, I\u2019ll get fat and old that way, and my heart will break, and I\u2019ll die. We flew back to the trailer park, Jacqui beefing every step of the way. \u201cI know Vegas is an ungodly town,\u201d she said. \u201cI know it\u2019s full of hookers and drugs and gambling. But they know they\u2019re a sin town and they know why they\u2019re sinning. That\u2019s why they\u2019re more honest in Vegas than all these other towns in America.\u201d Also, we had run out of cocaine. I had to do a post-assignment debriefing with Glovemaster, who was even more fretful than Jacqui. \u201cI thought the Mealybug was just nervous,\u201d said the blue glove on the laptop screen. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that he had real exterminators. In Vegas, they\u2019re fumigating the Imperial Hotel.\u201d \u201cYeah, I saw that on the news there. They say it\u2019s bedbugs. Big local scandal.\u201d \u201cHow much trouble is he in, the Mealybug?\u201d \u201cPlenty of trouble, but it\u2019s cool. I rescued him. His enemies have no idea who I am.\u201d \u201cThey know who am! They know I sprung the Mealybug from that trap in Vegas. They know that I know where the Mealybug has gone.\u201d \u201cThey doxxed your whale\u2014are they doxxing you, too, Glovemaster? Is this video call secure?\u201d \u201cHow should I know? Find out who they are and get rid of them, Colonel! Get them off my back.\u201d \u201cI might do that, if the money\u2019s right. Where is the Mealybug?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s in Miami,\u201d the Glovemaster muttered. \u201cYou should go there right away.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, because I needed the money, but maybe I shouldn\u2019t have done that. Maybe I should have talked the Glovemaster out of his loyalty to the Mealybug. A lot of coinbros will worship some cryptocoin whale, but that devotion never goes both ways. When the followers become useless, they can come to harm. After surviving fear and loathing in Las Vegas, I knew that Miami was likely to be worse\u2014but then came some Amazon boxes. Bigger boxes, arriving at my dead drop. This time, it looked like some human being had meddled with the golden flakes. They\u2019d smelted them into coin-like slugs, some kind of manufacturing value-add. Down at the pawnshop, Duke had a good look through his jeweler\u2019s loupe. \u201cI knew a Jewish guy once who showed me these. Souvenirs from a raid on Islamic terrorists. This is smuggler\u2019s gold. Out of the \u2018hawala\u2019 scene, like from Sudan, Bombay, Dubai.\u201d \u201cCan you melt it down for me, so it looks like normal gold?\u201d \u201cAre you crazy? American gold bugs go nuts for this! This is gold that is off the grid. Shit-hits-the-fan gold. Total-world-armageddon gold.\u201d I\u2019d never seen Duke so goldbuggy, so I swapped him four of the creepy nuggets and redeemed everything I\u2019d ever pawned to him. I took the remainder in fiat cash. Some bills turned out to be counterfeit, but that wasn\u2019t Duke\u2019s fault, because fiat is bullshit. There was no room in our trailer for all the cool stuff we\u2019d bought during the brief Dogecoin peak. With all our brutal bad luck since then, I\u2019d forgotten those weeks when we were almost millionaires. I\u2019d pawned my electronics mostly, like my Dogecoin mining rigs, but also all of Jacqui\u2019s kitchen appliances. Now we could barely move\u2014we had to sidle sideways through our high-stacked house goods\u2014but she was happy enough to weep tears of joy. \u201cGosh, Vegas was such a luck-charm for us! We should fly back there right away!\u201d \u201cI have to go to Miami. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t grow on trees, babe. They have to mine it.\u201d \u201cCan I come, too? Green candles! Line goes up!\u201d She was so cute when she spoke coinbro. At Miami Airport all the taxi drivers tried to chisel us, but I was hip to their penny-ante hustle and I rented a Jeep Wrangler. I even paid for it with Bitcoin, first time I\u2019d ever been able to do that, and it was an account that Glovemaster had stolen and lent to me, which made it even sweeter. Once we were lodged in our classy Miami Beach hotel\u2014a honeymoon hotel, because I was out of Jacqui\u2019s doghouse and I wanted to stay that way\u2014I flipped open the laptop. In poured a new heap of encrypted Protonmail from Glovemaster, who\u2019d been getting steadily more agitated during the time it took us to get to Florida. Tourists always look like fishbait in Miami, so I told Jacqui to doll up so she could pass for a good-looking local. I wouldn\u2019t claim that Miami women have their own dress code, but they sure as hell don\u2019t dress like normal girls. Also, Floridians never mess around with masks or social distancing, so Jacqui could socialize all she wanted. Jacqui was outgoing, she was a charmer, she was good at weddings, church services, and Republican Party meetings. As for me, back to the hard work. You know: \u201cI wish I had a bass boat and a Z-28/but I guess that stuff\u2019ll have to wait\u201d which was from our song, me and Jacqui\u2019s. My lifetime favorite, \u201cMoney in the Bank\u201d from the 1993 album by the great John Anderson, a true American songwriter-poet. John Anderson never tells lies about life. Not to interrupt my story here, but that good ole boy is the real deal. I hummed this anthem as I paged through Glovemaster\u2019s freaked-out emails. Sure enough, my too-daring teen boy had stirred up a wasp\u2019s nest. He had always loved to rob the hick fundies and the QAnon types\u2014easy marks for a high-SAT high schooler\u2014but the American capital of electronic crime is not Trenton, New Jersey. It\u2019s Boca Raton, Florida. Not a lot of people know that Boca is a buzzing colony of multi-generational crime families, scamming people worldwide with fake emails and phone calls. Those American confidence racketeers, some of them date way back to the 1920s. There\u2019s even an old black-and-white Marx Brothers movie , where everybody is ripping off everybody else for fake real-estate\u2014that would totally be them in Boca, except much, much less funny. Glovemaster, gloved hand in hand with the high-rolling Mealybug, had got himself on the wrong side of these chicken-fried con men. Just blundered into the stinging midst of them, somehow, like a drunk kid party-crashing a Florida swamp full of mosquitos. They were counter attacking him with multiple fraud schemes\u2014posing as the FBI (a particular con-man favorite), as IRS agents eager to audit him, as Russian intelligence. Sometimes with death threats, sometimes as alluring girls in trouble pleading for his help . . . Glovemaster was getting a whirlwind of too-clever bullshit in his Twitter direct messages, in his Discord chats, all over. They were stalking him and they were gonna skin him, too, but they wanted to skin the Mealybug much, much more. Because the Mealybug was fatter, slower, and tastier. I paged through these fantastic threats\u2014it amazed me that hundreds of wildly different spam ambush messages could be written by maybe just five dudes in Boca. More than boiler-room con-men, they were creative writers. One particularly freaky message stopped me cold. . . . . . . . I\u2019d never seen any online pitch this weird, and I\u2019d seen plenty. Then I realized this must be written by some GPT-4 offshoot, except whatever they had primed this AI with, it wasn\u2019t English. I contacted Glovemaster directly. He didn\u2019t give a damn about Artificial Intelligences writing weird spam. \u201cAre you in Miami with the Mealybug?\u201d \u201cYeah. I\u2019m gonna arrange a personal meeting.\u201d \u201cLook, Colonel, I got you this job because a guy with five tours in Afghanistan is never gonna back down. But every friend that the Mealybug had\u2014we\u2019re all scattering. The Mealybug had three-hundred-K followers on Twitter alone, but they\u2019re going dark. They\u2019re pretending they never had anything to do with him. Me too, Colonel. I\u2019m outta here. I gotta book a flight. In another name. Thank God you sold me those fake passports.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t overdo it with those,\u201d I told him, because forged US passports from Pakistan might pass muster in Pakistan, but nowhere else\u2014except maybe with teenagers in New Jersey. \u201cI can\u2019t let them get me. I\u2019m thinking Dubai.\u201d \u201cDubai makes sense. Good place to start over, I hear.\u201d \u201cI just dunno who to trust right now,\u201d said the Glovemaster, trusting me, \u201cbut the good thing is, we can still trust in cryptographic mathematics, right? We can rely on the internet and the blockchain and computational power. Blockchain works anywhere in the world.\u201d \u201cBlockchain really exists. The source code is visible and transparent.\u201d \u201cThe whole world will be completely transformed by blockchain,\u201d the Glovemaster pleaded. \u201cI\u2019m totally with that program,\u201d I said. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, the old world is already gone.\u201d \u201c\u2018We\u2019re All Gonna Make It.\u2019 We just need to stay on the good side of a few special people. To respect their ideological commitment to self-sovereign identity.\u201d \u201cOh yeah,\u201d I said. \u201cCall me Mister Diamond Hands.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to the Moon,\u201d he told me. Then the Glovemaster folded his blue gloved fingers and I never heard from him again. Not a gesture. Not a whisper. Not a funeral for him, even. Jacqui came back with her shopping bags, a little tipsy, but in a good way. \u201cWow, Miami is so terrific! I wanna live here! You won\u2019t believe the classy women I\u2019ve met!\u201d \u201cIt was good fun, huh?\u201d I\u2019d been hitting a hip-flask of Venezuelan rum to deal with the bad vibes from the Glovemaster\u2019s paranoia. \u201cThey\u2019re a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Just like grandma\u2019s quilting bee\u2014all the girls are nice, everybody\u2019s an equal, everybody gets to chat as much they like. And, the way we all get rich together is to boost the floor price of Wicked WASP ProFile Pics! They\u2019re NFT art, like, cool token cartoons of really mean White Anglo-Saxon chicks. Miami chicks think they\u2019re hilarious. Especially when they really are WASP chicks in Miami. \u2018Cause there are lots of them here.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that you\u2019re a WASP yourself, Jacqui.\u201d \u201cWow, that makes it even more perfect! Do you think half an eth was too much for my new ProFile Pic?\u201d That stopped me. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you still had any ether.\u201d \u201cI used the coin you gave me for our wedding.\u201d So I had left the wife alone for maybe five hours, and she plunged into a Florida sorority with an entrance fee of about two grand in fiat. Her wedding dowry was supposed to be our last-ditch bug-out money if the IRS ever came to shoot us. I felt like grabbing her by her suntanned neck and tossing her off our eighth-floor Miami balcony with its beach view. But that was the Venezuelan rum doing my thinking for me. I should know better than have anything to do with Venezuela, that stinking socialist sump. I was in Miami, the capital of Bitcoin, chasing the payoff that would save us. A husband protects his wife. He doesn\u2019t blow a major business deal just because she\u2019s acting like a woman. To keep my wits sharp, I did some of the coke that Jacqui broke out. Miami was crammed with Colombian marching-powder, so of course she\u2019d copped some from a new girlfriend. Also, in Miami the coke was great. I was rubbing my gums when my cell phone doinged with a text: Hemimetabolous will meet with you. Be at the fountain at the foot of Sixteenth Street and Collins. A limo will be there in thirty minutes. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Jacqui asked. \u201cI\u2019ve got to work. It\u2019s business.\u201d She blinked. \u201cA couple of the WASP girls invited me to a Historic Homes of Miami Tour. I might go out with them.\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d Sixteenth Street was only four blocks from our hotel. I strolled down Collins in the early evening. As I walked, I calculated the angles on my client and sponsor, Mr. Mealybug Hemimetabolous. I\u2019d been researching him online. Everybody thinks they\u2019re anonymous on the blockchain. They\u2019re only as anonymous as \u201c34xp4vRoCGJym3xR7yCVPFHo\u201d is anonymous. Especially those early guys, the Crypto OGs, they were wild and careless. And Mr. Mealybug, he\u2019d been an Ethereum founder, from that very first Initial Coin Offering. He was a crypto world-beater, the Mealybug. His blockchain programs in Ethereum did not look like anybody else\u2019s. Solidity, Dart, Delphi, Go, Java, Python, Ruby, Rust\u2014he never used any Ethereum-supported languages. Instead, his programs looked like raw machine-language gibberish that were just somehow\u2014 , with Ethereum dapps like a sharp beak plunged into a vein. With the coke to boost me, I lurked by the fountain on 16th, feeling a little paranoid but, mostly, sharp-witted and aggressive. I had it figured that the Mealybug was not a coinbro at all. Never a real fintech guy. Those guys build the blockchain systems and then buy and hold on. They don\u2019t write back-doors that can puncture a blockchain and silently drain its resources. It smelled like covert cyberwar. Especially the \u201cNorks,\u201d because the North Koreans have perpetrated sixty percent of all the heists in crypto history. So then, what was his life story, the mysterious Mr. Hemimatabolous? Why is he scurrying from Vegas to Miami? Why hire Lieutenant Colonel Wayne Osborne of Black Diamond Security to protect him? Why not just go to his spymasters in North Korea, the ones who gave him the super-weird zero-day backdoor software? Because he\u2019s a double-crossing rip-off artist, that\u2019s why. He\u2019s not loyal to North Korea. He\u2019s a cyberwar operator on the run. Also, he\u2019s losing his friends right and left, because the North Koreans are vindictive bastards. When they send you death threats they\u2019re not real great at English. They sound like Commies from Mars. I was working this new theory about the Mealybug when the limo showed up, an enormous black Mercedes SUV. I heard the back door unlatch and I climbed inside. No one was driving. The car crossed over South Beach to the mainland and drove near Camp Biscayne. The tall buildings drifted away and the landscape got tropical. So, why Vegas? Because Vegas was discreet and he was hiding there, but he got found out. Why Miami? Because Miami is a wide-open gateway to the Caribbean and Central America. His pursuers are at his heels. He\u2019s searching the planet for fresh nooks and crannies. The limo slowed and pulled up to the gate of a historically-protected property from the first Miami real-estate boom. A handsome compound with tall palms behind high pink stucco walls with broken glass on top. Brass plaques at the gate with the names of offshored shell companies. I was afraid of that mansion\u2014but also, I wanted to own it. Quiet billionaire property. Servants and attendants. You could send goons to attack the U.S. Senate from a place like that and nobody would dare to arrest you. \u201cPersonal self-sovereignty.\u201d \u201cPrivate Protection Service Strategies.\u201d I was hustling a double-crossing billionaire who was terrified of the North Koreans. But I\u2019d already saved his life once. \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy, be greedy when others are fearful\u201d\u2014that\u2019s what Warren Buffett says. The Mealybug was fearful. Maybe I could be the greedy winner, for once. One fast smash-and-grab raid, in Caribbean pirate-style. \u201cLieutenant Colonel Wayne Osborne of the Delta Force\u201d grabs the keys to the gold-bug castle. Wayne Osborne shuts down his websites and email, he \u201cpulls the rug,\u201d and there\u2019s nobody there anymore. Then me and Jacqui are Mr. and Mrs. Michael J. Luftschager. Not just a happy couple with the white picket fence, we\u2019re oligarchs in a palace. Our kids are born rich. The silent gates swung open. The car rolled toward a 1920s era mansion, pastel stucco with mullioned windows. By modern mega-mansion standards, it was cute and little-girlish even, like the lair of a silent-film actress. Madame had spent decades grooming her date palms, orchids, croquet ground, fountains, koi pond, magnolias, and mangoes. A lovely old garden, but all of these plants looked kinda peaked, like they were somehow drained. I rang the doorbell, one of those video-equipped smart-house security units. The front door opened, revealing an empty foyer. Two guard dogs loped up from the depths of the house. Silent, well-trained dogs, the kind that can rip the arteries out of your legs. Warily I followed the silent dogs to an interior parlor, a rich-girl\u2019s dainty piano room re-wired as a monitored guard shack. There sat the Mealybug\u2019s bodyguard and factotum. None other than the infamous Pavel Marco. Although he looked wrinkled and sick, I recognized him. I had met him once, at an embassy affair in Kuwait, and he\u2019d made a huge impression on me. When I\u2019d first come to admire him, he was a swaggering Global War on Terror buccaneer. An elite for-hire Blackwater Secret Squirrel type, more suave than any Bond villain, an olive-skinned millionaire hustler with thick silver hair swept back from his forehead, bespoke suit and tie, creased trousers, Italian shoes. Not American\u2014Americans weren\u2019t cool enough. A Greek Cypriot, because in the Middle East the Cypriots were plausibly deniable by everybody. \u201cAren\u2019t you Dr. Pavel Marco?\u201d I asked. He looked a little surprised. \u201cI haven\u2019t used that name in quite a while.\u201d \u201cI met you when you worked for the Saudis in Kuwait City. You wouldn\u2019t remember me\u2014I was just a bean-sprout back then.\u201d \u201cAnd you are?\u201d \u201cLieutenant Colonel Wayne Osborne, Delta Force.\u201d \u201cI do remember you. You were at Fallujah.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right. \u2018Vigilant Resolve,\u2019 2004.\u201d \u201cYou look quite different now.\u201d \u201cI got a desk job. Civilian life. Crypto finance tech.\u201d \u201cVery well. The Mealybug has hired you, so I have to direct you. This is our strategic situation. They know about this house, because they doxxed it. They know about the yacht, they doxxed that too. Also they know about the Progeny in the gardens. Because of the Progeny, they will attack, so we have to conduct the Mealybug from the house to the yacht.\u201d \u201cProgeny?\u201d \u201cThe larvae. We may lose some of them. There are more in the yacht.\u201d \u201cLarvae?\u201d \u201cThe offspring. The larvae in Vegas were poisoned after we fled the beetles.\u201d \u201cYou mean the cars.\u201d \u201cI mean the predatory insects from another world. When we move her, we can\u2019t let her be seen.\u201d ? \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cBecause she\u2019s an insect,\u201d he said, exasperated, as if I were a three-year old. \u201cWait. The Mealybug is a ?\u201d Pavel Marco studied me. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know,\u201d he said, wondering. \u201cExactly how ignorant are you?\u201d \u201cI knew enough to identify those car bombs in Vegas.\u201d Marco\u2019s spotted hands trembled, from palsy, or anger, or both. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem as bright as most computer hackers, soldier. But given this crisis, I guess you\u2019ll have to do.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m here to help. The Mealybug, how big is it? Maybe we can move it in one of your Doberman\u2019s cages.\u201d \u201c\u2018Her,\u2019 not \u2018it!\u2019\u201d Marco snapped. \u201cThe Mealybug is a precious creature, a princess from another planet! You can\u2019t just ship her like a bale of hundred-dollar bills.\u201d \u201cYeah. Right, sorry.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be misled by the Internet propaganda! This extraterrestrial coalition trying to exterminate her\u2014once they\u2019ve killed her, do you think they\u2019ll leave our planet? Never! They are the occupation forces! Destroying our freedom, regulating everything, forcing us to conform to senseless rules of conduct made far away . . . they\u2019ll enslave us! Just because we were hospitable to her\u2014just because she was our precious, honored guest!\u201d Was this dementia? \u201cI\u2019ve never met the Mealybug. Can I? Now? I mean, if you please?\u201d Marco stood, gripping the arm of the padded office chair. At that embassy years ago, among a crowd of Arab Princes, French diplomats, Kurds, Syrians, Iranian Shi\u2019ites\u2014everybody making the War on Terror impossible to win\u2014he\u2019d been a chic, self-possessed operator, a ladies\u2019 man with two Lebanese belly-dancers smoking kif in the back of his Rolls-Royce. Now, as we tottered toward a back room, he grumbled about his Gulf War Syndrome. He had every symptom and then some: chronic fatigue, memory loss, diarrhea, palsy, blinding headaches, debilitating muscle pains. To sit still, stare at screens, and push buttons, that was all that was left to him. We ventured into madame\u2019s pink-tinted boudoir\u2014with the two big guard-dogs sniffing along. And there she was. The Dobermans seemed to adore the Mealybug, or at least they admired what she was eating, from a big ceramic trough. A kind of flower-planter, loaded with five-star hotel fruit plates dumped under her beak like ten Carmen Miranda headdresses: pineapple chunks, kiwi, sliced coconut, canistel, chocolate persimmon, jackfruit, mamey, sapote, tiny little purple plantains, all of this bounty fermenting in the trough with a minor cloud of fruit flies. She didn\u2019t mind the fruit flies, being akin to them. She was lozenge-shaped, flower-like, with waxy, pink-tinted petals all over her. Her mouth slurped steadily, like a teen-girl over a too-thick milkshake, and she had round lidless shoe-button eyes, six of them, coyly hidden under wax flakes like bangs. She was warm-blooded. Hotter than human blood-heat, even, hot and smelly\u2014a good smell, like fresh-baked bread. Not as big as a human woman, but good-sized, bigger than the Dobermans. I got the impression that her six limbs, which were demurely folded under her, were not like bugs\u2019 arms, they were like girls\u2019 arms, sleek and tender-skinned, with bones inside, and nicely-kept embroidery-needle fingers. I felt absolutely no sense of repulsion. I felt awe. \u201cHow long have you been with her?\u201d I asked Pavel. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the first to protect her, but I was the first to survive. We got wind of those meteors out of the desert\u2014chunks of raw gold falling out the sky in the Rub\u2019 al Khali.\u201d He lifted his doddering head. \u201cI had lost the War on Terror. But with her, I couldn\u2019t lose. Always the winner, with her. And never two days alike, with her! Every day an adventure! She\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d A big beautiful many-limbed bug slurping up rotting fruit at a trough. If you\u2019d told me that I\u2019d buy that, I would have laughed at you. But that\u2019s not how I felt. Just being near her gave me a sense of peace, like all the striving I had been doing, my whole life, was wasted energy. That was over now. I didn\u2019t have to be smart all the time just to survive. \u201cYou feel it too, don\u2019t you,\u201d Pavel said. \u201cShe plays the crypto game better than any human, enough to pile a stack of imaginary coins up to the stars. But who needs money when you have her?\u201d \u201cAnd they\u2019re coming to kill her,\u201d I said. \u201cWe can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d A door chime sounded. Pavel pulled a Beretta M9 sidearm, looked reluctantly at the powerful, elegant weapon in his palsied hand, and put the gun back in his armpit. I left him with the Mealybug and hurried to the security screen room. Outside the mansion\u2019s front door stood three elegant, well-to-do white women. A blonde, a redhead\u2014and Jacqui. \u201cHello in there?\u201d Jacqui said, leaning to the speaker so her face loomed in the camera. \u201cWe\u2019re here for the Historic Homes of Miami Tour? Your gate was open. May we come in?\u201d I couldn\u2019t find the speaker button to reply to her. This didn\u2019t seem to bother Jacqui\u2019s WASP friends. They ignored the locked house, plucked up some fallen Florida palmetto leaves\u2014like canoe paddles, with teeth on both sides\u2014and commenced to thrash the garden foliage. There were cocoons in the trees. The Mealybug\u2019s children, stuck in tropical bushes like Mexican pinatas. Pavel Marco appeared behind me. \u201cThis is it,\u201d he said, \u201cthe assault.\u201d He pulled open a drawer and got out a Mercedes key fob. \u201cGet the SUV out of the garage. I\u2019ll get the Mealybug.\u201d I hesitated. I couldn\u2019t leave Jacqui out there. Instead of finding the garage I went out to rescue her. I caught up to her as she stood staring at her women friends. Except they weren\u2019t women anymore. The women\u2014the wasp-things\u2014were grabbing the shattered larvae. Their jaws unhinged and they went mad with frenzied glee, devouring the Mealybug\u2019s babies. The pulp of the larvae dripped from their maws to their cute frocks. \u201cWhoa!\u201d Jacqui said. \u201cThose are Lily Pulitzer dress sets! We just bought those!\u201d \u201cWe need to leave. Right now.\u201d \u201cWhat happened to my friends?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re not your friends. They\u2019re extraterrestrial exterminators.\u201d \u201cWhat are they eating?\u201d \u201cThe Mealybug\u2019s babies.\u201d \u201cWow! That\u2019s so creepy! Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d \u201cI have to save the Mealybug,\u201d I said, clutching the key fob. \u201cThere\u2019s a car in the garage. I need to get it.\u201d \u201cGimme that,\u201d Jacqui said, grabbing the fob from my hand. \u201cI\u2019ll get the car. You get the Mealybug.\u201d She seemed energized in a way I had not seen before. More WASP women arrived at the gate. I dashed back into the house. In the boudoir, Pavel was communing with the Mealybug, who held his shriveled hands with two of her six arms, her gray eyes shining. \u201cWe must reach the yacht,\u201d Pavel said. \u201cI used to be able to lift her.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all right. From now on I\u2019ll do it.\u201d The Mealybug turned her alien face toward a nearby desktop screen. Text appeared on it. \u201cWill there be food?\u201d the screen recited aloud. The synthesized voice was a startling contralto. \u201cMuch food aboard the yacht, your highness,\u201d Pavel promised. She emitted a spiracled moan, hopped off her pedestal, and moved toward me. I got my arms below her and lifted her off the floor. She weighed about as much as a large poodle. She wrapped her top forelimbs around my neck. My cheek brushed the carapace of waxy exudate that covered her back. She smelled like heaven. She folded up her other limbs and settled into my arms, her multi-eyed head resting on my shoulder. I didn\u2019t waste time: out of the room, down the hall, out the front door. Jacqui was there behind the wheel of the Mercedes, motor running. \u201cThe hatch!\u201d I called. The hatchback opened. I gently laid the Mealybug into a little throne back there, a specialized socket tailor-made just for her, where she could watch over the back seat and tell the driver what to do. Pavel made a brave effort to man the front passenger seat, with his gun in hand, but he was crippled with pain and weariness. I had to shove him into the back seat like a collapsing bag of groceries. As I came around the side the wasp women staggered forward, bloated with prey, questing fingernails grown to hollow black stingers. I climbed in and slammed the door; the wasps scraped and scratched at the car\u2019s glossy finish. Jacqui floored it, the wheels spat gravel, and the wasp women went airborne. Out on the boulevard we swerved into the night traffic. \u201cTo the marina,\u201d gasped Pavel. \u201cIsland Gardens. Quickly.\u201d \u201cPavel, this is my wife Jacqui,\u201d I said. I got out my GPS. \u201cHere\u2014follow this.\u201d The Mealybug\u2019s contralto voice came from the dashboard sound system. \u201cMind the speed limit.\u201d At the Island Gardens Marina, six chic Bahama supercruisers shone under cool vapor-lighting, multipurpose vehicles for the multinational Miami elite. Suppose you\u2019re rich, you\u2019ve got enemies. Well, you climb aboard one of those floating mansions and next day you\u2019re over the blue horizon, surrounded by your paid staff, no warrants at the door, no cops, no snoops, no North Koreans, no Boca Raton scammer mafia\u2014just the protectors on your payroll, and your precious self. The Mealybug\u2019s gleaming white sixty-meter yacht was staffed 24/7, with a well-trained international crew of discreet Filipinos and Indians. We got the princess on board and into her owner\u2019s suite. Pavel Marco spoke with the captain about our destination: El Salvador. The mate led me and Jacqui to a private cabin. Satin pillows on the bed, a sofa and big TV, polished wooden highlights, a wide window with a view of the lights of the nighttime marina and the dark ocean beyond. \u201cBetter than any house, eh?\u201d I said. \u201cAs soon as we cast off, we\u2019re safe. Out in international waters, we\u2019re finally self-sovereign.\u201d Jacqui did not sit. \u201cI\u2019m not going, Mike.\u201d \u201cWhat? Why not?\u201d \u201cWell, because I\u2019m an American. I\u2019ve never been out of the country. I don\u2019t even have a passport.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t have mine either. There are work-arounds for that.\u201d She looked at me, her eyes large. \u201cEver since Vegas I\u2019ve been thinking. Mike, you try too hard. Since the day we got married, you\u2019ve been trying too hard. All this Colonel Wayne Osborne stuff. Because of me. I spend money and I look good and that\u2019s about it.\u201d \u201cI love you like that!\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t love me when I told you I spent our IRS safe money. We\u2019re not happy. I spend as much time trying to be the girl next door for you as you do trying to be a tough guy. We don\u2019t do anything together except for drugs, TV, or sex. It\u2019s going nowhere.\u201d \u201cBut look where we are right now! Look at this place! We\u2019re hooked up with a billionaire, a one percenter, the biggest crypto whale you\u2019ve ever seen\u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014who\u2019s a bug from outer space.\u201d \u201cNobody has to know that.\u201d \u201cBigger bugs are trying to eat him.\u201d \u201cHer.\u201d \u201cHer, okay.\u201d \u201cYou just need to see her, spend some time with her.\u201d \u201cLike this Pavel guy? He can\u2019t even see me. He\u2019s falling apart.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s his Gulf War Syndrome. I knew him back in Kuwait.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got better ideas, Mike. I met this classy older lady, Vanessa, through the WASP club. She knows powerful people, and she likes me!\u201d \u201cIs she another insect?\u201d \u201cNot this one. She\u2019s very religious.\u201d I hadn\u2019t been in a church since our wedding day, but Jacqui liked church and had lots of connections there. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Jacqui soothed me. \u201cI\u2019ll keep the secret about your Mealybug. I know your crypto secrets are important to you. You deserve to be together for as long as you can.\u201d \u201cBut what will you do, baby?\u201d She smiled her best girl-next-door smile. \u201cMe? I\u2019m gonna become an influencer. I\u2019m halfway there already, actually. I influenced the shit out of you.\u201d That\u2019s how I lost Jacqui. I\u2019d lost my computer, too, back at the Miami hotel room, security-locked and encrypted. I borrowed a no-name PC from one of the yacht crew and, since I wasn\u2019t a newbie idiot, I pulled a 128-gigabyte USB key off my keychain. I plugged it in, I held my breath\u2014and up it came, a secure TAILS operating system, cold storage for my crypto holdings, all the social media for Colonel Wayne Osborne. Thanks to my operational backup, I had escaped a crypto bro\u2019s worst nightmare. I was still in business. On the way to El Salvador, I sat down to compose an email to Jacqui, some argument to make her see what she was missing out on. But as I wrote it, I got to thinking: what kind of life was I offering her? This girl who\u2019d never asked me for anything except to honor my marriage vows and keep my promises. She didn\u2019t marry some heavy international operator in the crypto scene. Jacqui had married Mike Luftschager. As I sat there tapping at my borrowed laptop, I realized that if there was one truly useless character in my situation, it was Mike Luftschager. Lieutenant Colonel Wayne Osborne might make a go of this adventure, if he was ruthless, disciplined, loyal, and never set a foot wrong. Mike Luftschager, that minnow among whales? He\u2019d be deader than the Glovemaster in half the time. Jacqui didn\u2019t need that email. The Mealybug\u2019s fabulous yacht took a trip through the Panama Canal, where it changed its name and colors with a brand-new Panamanian registration. Pavel Marco said this would throw off the scent, and soon enough we were in El Salvador, on the fintech scene, the first nation-state to accept Bitcoin as legal tender. We moved into the brand new complex next to the volcano-powered Bitcoin mines. The Mealybug seemed pleased about her new lair, but the shock of this novelty was too much for Marco\u2014after his long illness, he went into sudden decline. He died in a marvelous place, though\u2014like a chunk of Dubai glittering at the base of Conchagua. Huge tin barns full of round-the-clock computation, a government-private partnership like structures dropped off a starship. I was there when Pavel gave up the ghost\u2014still at his laptop, with all his secure passwords and wallets sitting wide-open. A handy development, because those new resources helped me manage the hustle of secretly burying a dead white spy in a Third World country. With Pavel Marco gone, someone had to take on the role of the Mealybug\u2019s protector and global financial agent. The best guy for that job was not Mike Luftschager, or Lieutenant Colonel Wayne Osborne, either. The ideal protector for the Mealybug was the famous and fearsome Pavel Marco. So for her sake, I ditched the useless Mike Luftschager. I rugpulled Wayne Osborne. I became Pavel Marco. My soul felt settled by this. I had to die inside a little\u2014when a man abandons sworn oaths and core values, that happens to him. But I saw with incisive sharpness how my career would flourish. The truth was simple: the future was not about me and my corny personal convictions. It was about creating a world safe for the Mealybug and her values. Those laser-eyed dudes behind the El Salvador government, they were clued-in about that. Hard headed libertarian visionaries from a sovereign nation. No one-world control freaks. No bureaucrats and bank gangsters. Pavel Marco could blaze new trails in that world. Who would miss Mike Luftschager? Well, Jacqui might, for a little while . . . but in Miami, the Bitcoin capital, she had found new purpose. I spied on her, off and on, as best I could. That \u201cclassy older lady\u201d she\u2019d made friends with in Miami turned out to be a socialite Republican Party operative. As NFT art collectors went, she seemed very active. Jacqui started with the NFT collections, but pretty soon she was into election truthing, and then immigration policies. Her charm came to the fore: she got her teeth done, and the blonde hair of a Fox News anchorwoman. Like she\u2019d predicted, she became an influencer: first the little podcasts, then the big YouTube shows, and finally the Build the Wall Movement, where she and her WASP friends fought to protect the world from alien invaders. Those alien invasion memes were a big hit with the QAnon people. They adored Jacqui. So I was proud of her, but she wasn\u2019t the girl I had married. At the sight of her yakking politics on camera, I went kinda numb below the belt. Also, she would have gotten the Mealybug killed, so she just wasn\u2019t someone I could have anything to do with. It happens. Sad. That\u2019s why I arranged this talk with you. The Mealybug may not be a social insect, but she does need allies. For her cause. You know my story now, and judging by your proven interest, you\u2019re a woman I can trust to help get the word out. Believe me: although crypto has been through a whole lot of ups and downs, we are Very Early Days, still. When she\u2019s not laying her eggs in the jungle, the Mealybug keeps busy: DeFi apps and protocol, a whole ecosystem. The Huxley Blockchain? That\u2019s her. The Brave New World Coder Club, also hers. She\u2019s yield farming. She\u2019s growing the TVL so we can capitalize. I can\u2019t even count the pseudonymous profiles she\u2019s created, a voluntary association of invented people, all contributing code to her Huxley ecosystem, creating apps and wallets, governance platforms, aggregators, and stablecoins. It\u2019s all happening right in front of our eyes. The future of wealth, right here, right now. It\u2019s just that the normies can\u2019t see it. So thanks again for coming down to see me here in the compound. I don\u2019t get around like I used to\u2014my health\u2019s not what it was. There\u2019s this need for absolute security; bandits and predators all over the place. Her enemies aren\u2019t sleeping. Neither am I, much, lately\u2014I\u2019m on watch every hour of the day. But I\u2019ve put aside the drugs and the booze\u2014I don\u2019t need those false highs. Not with my laser-focus on my new sense of purpose\u2014and that can be yours, too! Every day an adventure!

        "content": ", Bethesda\u2019s newest RPG, is, well\u2026a big game. It\u2019s filled with quests to complete and aliens to shoot. It\u2019s also . And it\u2019s very easy to pick up too much junk and suddenly find yourself overencumbered, unable to fast-travel or sprint as much as usual. That\u2019s no fun! But you can avoid this annoying situation. I\u2019ve played about 55 hours of so far, and for most of that time, I\u2019ve not been overencumbered. In fact, I\u2019m usually carrying under 100kg of weight at any given time. What\u2019s my secret? Well, , I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at managing all the weapons, health items, and junk you collect as you adventure through the studio\u2019s massive open-world RPGs. So let me help you stop being overencumbered with these tips and tricks! Look, okay, I know this is very obvious and all that, but\u2026yeah, stop grabbing everything! I get it. This is a Bethesda game and one of the joys of these RPGs is how everything can be grabbed, manipulated, stored, and sold. Every plastic cup and dart and sandwich. But you don\u2019t need to grab it all. Well, sure, but you won\u2019t get that for that junk. And there are better ways to make credits in this game, like doing quests and selling high-value items like rare suits, guns, and very lightweight objects that are worth hundreds of credits. So yeah, stop. Put that cup down. Walk away. Leave it. Leave it! I\u2019m watching. Certain stats are always useful in a Bethesda open-world RPG. Having extra health and the ability to lockpick anything, for example, are as handy in as they were in . Similarly, leveling up the skill that lets you carry more stuff without becoming overencumbered is very useful. I also recommend grabbing this early so you can start grinding away at its requirements to unlock higher levels. Trust me, this will save you time in the long run. You can sort your by weight and you should do this regularly, as you\u2019ll often find some random spacesuit or other item taking up a large chunk of your carrying capacity. Take care of these items and don\u2019t let them clutter up your character. While looking at your heaviest bits of junk, you might also find one of the most likely culprits for why you are overencumbered: ship parts. Ship parts! These items are very useful, letting you repair your ship during combat. However, they are also very heavy, weighing 10kg each. It\u2019s very easy to collect a stack of these and not realize it until you pick up a gun and become overencumbered. Making matters worse, these heavy items are found not in your resources or misc. tab, but instead buried with your aid items, like food and health kits. This makes them easy to miss when dropping off resources to your ship. I\u2019d love a future update to move these to resources by default. Until then, double-check whenever you feel too heavy to make sure you aren\u2019t carrying around a bunch of these bulky items. And, one last thing: You can store these on your ship and still use them, no need to carry them around! There are a lot of weapons in , from laser rifles to old Earth shotguns and more. It\u2019s a smorgasbord of killing options. But while I recommend you try everything at least once early on in , after the opening hours you should settle on three or four weapons and sell or store the rest. This has a lot of benefits. You can focus your skills more, carry less ammo, and not have to manage an armory everywhere you go. But also, it means you\u2019ll not be bogged down by 12 weapons all using up your precious carrying capacity! And that\u2019s\u2014 , I told you to put down that plastic cup! Stop! Just because we\u2019re on a new tip doesn\u2019t mean I stopped watching! After you\u2019ve been out on a planet exploring, mining, or completing quests, you should take a moment to drop off excess items in your ship\u2019s cargo hold. Thankfully, Bethesda added a hotkey that lets you send all your resources\u2014like minerals, metals, etc.\u2014right to your ship with one button press. But don\u2019t just store resources in your ship\u2019s cargo containers. You can store rare suits or guns you want to sell later in there too, as well as other items that are taking up space. And if your ship starts to run out of space, well, first, maybe stop grabbing everything. But also, invest in adding some more storage to your ship, which you can do at any spaceport with an NPC starship technician. Oh, and don\u2019t forget: You can upgrade your ship\u2019s storage capacity via the Payloads perk. During my third night of playing , I stumbled upon a legendary suit that let me carry 40 extra kilograms on my character. While you might not find one as good as this, keep an eye out for spacesuits that provide extra storage. If you travel with a companion, don\u2019t forget to use them like a pack mule. They can carry quite a bit, which can help out a lot in big space dungeons filled with good loot. Just talk to your companion and ask to trade, then shove all the plastic cups and crappy guns into their inventory so you can sell it all later. Perhaps you\u2019ve done everything above and yet still find yourself carrying too much junk. Well, that\u2019s why I recommend keeping some whiskey or other chems on hand, as using them can increase your carrying capacity. Keep in mind that these are just temporary solutions and won\u2019t last forever. But they can, in a pinch, help you stop being overencumbered just long enough to fast-travel and sell all your junk.",

What about neodymium, praseodymium and dysprosium? These rare earth metals are used to build the powerful magnets in wind turbines.",
        "content": "September 7, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source written by researcher(s) proofread by Serasu Duran, Atalay Atasu and Clara Carrera, The Conversation What do silver, silicon and gallium have in common? These expensive raw materials are essential components of our various solar energy technologies. What about neodymium, praseodymium and dysprosium? These rare earth metals are used to build the powerful magnets in wind turbines . Keeping our planet livable requires accelerated clean energy transitions by governments\u2014 global carbon emissions must halve by 2030 and achieve net-zero by 2050. But a more ambitious clean energy transition requires more of the metals and minerals used to build clean energy technologies. As the global energy sector shifts from fossil fuels to clean energy , the demand of precious metals \u2014known as critical minerals \u2014is increasing. A striking example is lithium, a metal used in electric vehicle batteries. Between 2018 and 2022, the demand for lithium increased by 25% per year . Under a net-zero scenario, lithium demand by 2040 could be more than 40 times what it was in 2020 . The current challenge lies in a supply and demand mismatch. The projected demand for critical minerals exceeds the available supply. Basic principles of economics dictate higher prices for these minerals. In addition, critical minerals have a geographically concentrated supply. These metals are only extracted from a handful of countries and are overwhelmingly processed in China . China, for example, extracts 60% and processes 90% of all rare earth elements. In comparison, the top oil-producing country\u2014the United States\u2014accounts for only 18% of the extraction and 20% of the processing of the whole industry . The geographical concentration may result in additional supply constraints. Indonesia, the world's first nickel producer, has progressively banned the export of nickel ore overseas in an attempt to strengthen domestic processing. The lack of geographical diversity in supply can increase price volatility. Lithium prices rose more than 400% in 2022, before dropping again by 65% in 2023 . Copper prices soared in Peru following social unrest and mine blockades . China, which controls 98% of the gallium supply, created a 40% spike in 2023 on gallium prices by setting severe restriction on exports due to \"national security reasons.\" If supply constraints continue, the prices of critical minerals could become too high. Installing clean energy could become too expensive, and governments may find it hard to reach their clean energy targets. The demand and supply balance must be restored by one of two ways: either by decreasing the demand for critical materials or increasing their supply. The most obvious way to restore the balance between supply and demand\u2014more mining\u2014is tricky. Mining is environmentally destructive and damages ecosystems and communities . Plans for opening new mines in France , Serbia and Portugal have seen massive social opposition, leaving their future uncertain. Opening a new mine can take more than 15 years on average , so projects started today might arrive too late. While some capacity can be built quicker by reopening old mines, and some projects are already underway , supply imbalances are expected to be inevitable by 2030 . Beyond mining, two alternative practical approaches exist. The first is to reduce the demand for critical minerals by clean energy technologies. With innovation and research and development, clean energy products can be redesigned to use less material in each generation. The silver content in solar cells dropped by 80% in one decade . Likewise, the cathodes in new electric vehicle batteries contain up to six times less cobalt than older models. The second alternative is to increase the supply of critical minerals by recovering them from older and used clean technology products via advanced recycling. Decommissioned solar panels might no longer produce energy but can be a valuable source of silver or silicon. Our past research has shown that discarded solar panels could outweigh new installations by the next decade as installers seek to replace older panels with newer, more efficient ones . By recovering critical minerals from this waste in a process known as urban mining , we could cover the demand for the materials needed for future energy installations. Our recent research with our colleague Luk Van Wassenhove compares the economic consequences of these two alternative approaches. If the scarcity of critical minerals is not extreme, reducing the critical material content of clean energy products would be the way to go. However, unintended consequences can be expected akin to the rebound effect or Jevon's paradox : by improving the efficiency of usage of critical minerals, producers can end up consuming more of it. As clean energy products use less critical material, their improved profitability could increase production even more. As a result, decreasing the material usage per product won't necessarily lead to a decrease in critical material demand overall. In contrast, our research suggests that recycling decommissioned products is not subject to such a rebound effect. A steady stream of recycled materials from end-of-life products protects producers from volatile commodity prices and better facilitates the critical energy transition. Setting up a recycling ecosystem requires greater effort than marginally changing a product's design. Firms need a cost-efficient reverse logistics system, recycling plants and infrastructure to get enough end-of-use products back and to process them. Sizeable initial capital investments will take time to recover and require firms and policymakers to adopt a long-term mindset. But there's room for optimism. The start-up ROSI Solar opened its first recycling plant in 2023, making France a pioneer in recovering high-purity silicon, silver and copper from end-of-use solar panels . Likewise, the U.S.-based SOLARCYCLE can recycle 95% of valuable materials in solar panels . Many electric vehicle makers, like Tesla, Renault and Nissan , have started projects to recycle batteries and ensure a riskless cobalt, nickel and lithium supply. Recycling may indeed be the path to affordable clean energy . This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Read the original article .",

        "content": "By SAMYA KULLAB (Associated Press) KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 The United Nations atomic watchdog warned of a potential threat to nuclear safety from a spike in fighting near Europe\u2019s largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine, whose forces continued pressing their counteroffensive on Saturday. The International Atomic Energy Agency said its experts deployed at the Russia-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant reported hearing numerous explosions over the past week, in a possible indication of increased military activity in the region. There was no damage to the plant. \u201cI remain deeply concerned about the possible dangers facing the plant at this time of heightened military tension in the region,\u201d IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi warned in a statement issued late Friday. He noted that the IAEA team was informed that staff at the nuclear power plant had been reduced temporarily to minimum levels due to concerns of more military activity in the area. \u201cWhatever happens in a conflict zone, wherever it may be, everybody would stand to lose from a nuclear accident, and I urge that all necessary precautions must be taken to avoid it happening,\u201d Grossi said.

        "description": "Cirrus Aircraft, after several years of strong growth, is headed for an initial public offering on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.",
        "content": "Cirrus Aircraft, after several years of strong growth, is headed for an initial public offering on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. The IPO venue may seem surprising, but not when you consider the Duluth, Minnesota-based company's atypical ownership: the Chinese government. The state-owned Chinese company that took control of Cirrus in 2011 has presided over a period of stability, including the successful launch of a new jet business. However, the company, aerospace giant AVIC, is on a U.S. government investment sanctions list aimed at companies linked to China's military. Two AVIC-controlled companies related to Cirrus are on a separate U.S. export control list due to their Chinese military association. Heightened tensions between China and the U.S. have so far had \"minimal\" impact on Cirrus, the company noted in its IPO filing. Still, it said an \"escalation in geopolitical tension ... could lead to a material adverse effect on our business.\" It's questionable whether a Chinese buyout of Cirrus would even be approved nowadays given the increasingly tense relations between the United States and China, analysts said. \"If a similar deal was brought [forward] today, there would be a lot more political barriers,\" Charlie Vest, associate director at Rhodium Group, a New York-based research and company. \"These are very different times in the relationship between the U.S. and China and the political dynamics of Chinese investments in the U.S. have changed.\" AVIC would ultimately still control Cirrus after the IPO, which aims to sell up to 20% of the company and raise roughly $200 million to $400 million. However, Zean Nielsen, the company's CEO, said Cirrus is operationally independent of its shareholders. He called Chinese government ownership \"just one of those things that just is. It doesn't really change how I run the company.\" \"My job is to take care of customers and employees the best I know how,\" he said. Cirrus readily complies with federal rules on Chinese investment in the U.S., he said. \"All the things we need to disclose, we happily do.\" Cirrus has been on a hot streak since Nielsen, a former Tesla executive, became CEO in 2019. The company's revenue grew from $586 million in 2020 to $894 million last year, while its profits more than doubled, according to its June IPO filing. Cirrus has a backlog of over 1,400 aircraft, which will keep its Duluth manufacturing plant busy. Cirrus' success has been good for Duluth. It's one of the city's largest employers with 1,588 workers \u2014 the majority in manufacturing and engineering. This month, the company expects to complete a new $20 million innovation center at its Duluth International Airport campus, freeing up about 75,000 square feet for manufacturing. Proceeds from the IPO will be used to further bolster manufacturing; expand Cirrus' growing services business; and invest in new technology, including more automation. \"We will continue to make flying a Cirrus easier and easier,\" Nielsen said. Cirrus is the leading U.S. maker of single-engine piston planes, and its SF Vision jet \u2014 launched in 2016 \u2014 has been a hit. The company has delivered 475 jets, including 90 in 2022, its best production year yet. Jets account for about 30 % of Cirrus' sales. \"They are playing to a niche where no one else plays,\" said Brian Foley, an aviation analyst. Cirrus essentially created a market for a single-engine jet. It's slower than a twin-engine jet, but its price point is considerably lower. The Cirrus jet goes for about $3.25 million, while the next cheapest jet in the market is a twin-engine Embraer model priced at $5 million, analysts say. AVIC's ultimate ownership was crucial in developing the jet, which had been on the drawing board since the 2000s. \"Without them, the SF50 probably wouldn't have happened,\" said Bruce McClelland, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group. \"Chinese investment got [Cirrus] over the hump to launch the aircraft.\" Indeed, Chinese investment rescued Cirrus. The aviation industry tanked after the 2008 global financial meltdown and Cirrus was in deep trouble. \"They simply ran out of money, and that is how China came into play,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst. AVIC's general aviation subsidiary paid $210 million for Cirrus and got the blessing of the U.S. Treasury Department's committee on foreign investment, which reviews deals for national security concerns. But in recent years, sentiment against Chinese investment in the United States has risen. Take the recent fate of a $700 million corn mill planned for Grand Forks, N.D. The mill proposed by Fufeng Group, a privately owned Chinese company, at first won state and local government support, hailed as an economic plum. But some local citizens began protesting the mill, including its Chinese ownership. In January, the U.S. Air Force weighed in, calling the project a national security threat; the mill would have been 12 miles from the Grand Forks Air Force Base. The Fufeng deal soon died. Ironically, Cirrus has a plant in Grand Forks that is only about 17 miles from the Grand Forks Air Force Base. It employs 494 people and makes components that are assembled into airplanes in Duluth. And Cirrus' main owner AVIC \u2014 unlike Fufeng \u2014 has been on the U.S. government's growing Chinese Military Industrial Complex (CMIC) blacklist since 2020. AVIC is a sprawling aerospace concern that supplies China's military, and some of its myriad subsidiaries have publicly traded stock. U.S. investors are restricted from investing in securities of companies on the CMIC list. But the investment restriction applies specifically to AVIC subsidiaries that are also on the CMIC list. The AVIC subsidiary that owns Cirrus \u2014 China General Aviation Industry General Aircraft (CAIGA) \u2014 isn't on the list. In other words, U.S. investors could buy Cirrus stock, the IPO filing said. AVIC owns 70% of CAIGA; the other 30% is held by three state-owned Chinese investment companies. Three other subsidiaries of CAIGA have been among Cirrus' top five customers for the past few years, and two of them \u2014 AG Huanan and AG Zhejiang \u2014 have been on the U.S. \"military end user\" (MEU) list since 2020, meaning they are subject to export controls. The list applies to military-connected companies in Russia, China, Venezuela and Burma. The three related companies accounted for less than 7% of Cirrus' sales during each of the last three years. Cirrus sells aircraft kits for a version of its SR20 plane to AG Huanan. It's developing a small prop plane \u2014 the AG100 \u2014 with AG Zhejiang for the China market. The plane is aimed at training green pilots. Cirrus has the proper U.S. export clearances for both of its Chinese customers on the MEU list, the company said in its IPO filing. The AG100 agreement with AG Zhejiang allows Cirrus to market a similar plane called the SR10 in the United States. But Cirrus doesn't have the incentive to do so right now, Nielsen said. Cirrus' prop planes are already used for training. China, on the other hand, has only a tiny civil aviation industry. Its airspace is restricted. The AG100 would be used by flight schools and is aimed at training commercial pilots, Nielsen said, and it's not intended for military use. Still, the AG 100 could conceivably be used for basic military training. After all, the U.S. Air Force uses Cirrus prop planes for training. \"If you are starting from the ground up \u2014 training military pilots \u2014 you do it in planes like this,\" said aviation industry analyst McClelland. However, analysts say it's generally hard to see military uses for Cirrus' products. Cirrus is far from the only U.S. aviation business that caught China's eye. Indeed, Aboulafia noted that before U.S.-Chinese tensions rose, several prominent U.S. aerospace companies entered joint ventures with Chinese companies \u2014 including with AVIC. \"They probably wouldn't be approved today, but no one wants to kill them now,\" Aboulafia said.",

        "content": "-- Shares Facebook Twitter Reddit Email American politics, like the man who jumps from a plane and only then considers his parachute, is in a bad way. Joe Biden's administration has some important successes \u2014 a few of them even \"bipartisan\" \u2014 but the political system seems unable to gain substantial traction on a wide array of dire problems. Climate change, voter suppression, reproductive rights, gun violence \u2014 all these afflictions fester while Republicans flog Hunter Biden and fulminate, with no apparent irony, about the Biden \"crime family.\" If we reach for a clich\u00e9 to describe this situation, we might alight on \"fiddling while Rome burns\" as a natural candidate, especially if our focus is on global warming. But fiddling is an activity that requites actual effort; this obstinate stasis in the face of existential challenges is an outrageously perverse refusal of action, undertaken simply because Republican politicians consider it to be in their political self-interest. In other words, the parlous state of American democracy is deeply rooted in the ongoing crisis of the Republican Party, a crisis that has been unfolding in real time for at least sixty years now. The seed of this crisis, the dark singularity from which it bloomed, was the decision by GOP leaders to pursue the support of white Southerners repulsed by the Democratic Party's embrace of the Civil Rights Movement in the nineteen-sixties. These voters, who had generally shunned Republicans since the hated Lincoln broke the Confederacy, were not a natural fit for the GOP as it existed in those years. A party with historical ties to the capitalist class and the aspirational bourgeoisie, it suddenly found itself inundated by millions of working-class voters whose instincts did not always align with its more traditional audience. To secure the long-term loyalty of these voters\u2014- and to cement a tectonic shift in the American party system\u2014- it needed to show them that their new electoral house was in fact a home. The forward-facing, commercial ethos of the old GOP would have to accommodate itself to the atavistic, Lost Cause-nostalgia of the American South. Individual rights would have to make room for states' rights; optimism for pessimism; a republic of consumers for an apartheid state; capitalism for feudalism. We need your help to stay independent Subscribe today to support Salon's progressive journalism Republican success in squaring this circle cannot be denied: Beginning with Richard Nixon in 1968, their presidential nominees won five of the next six elections and states across the South and Midwest gradually came under GOP control. But it came at a price, one paid in two different coins. The first was demographic. The darker, harsher rhetoric the party used to succor its new Southern voters struck some old-line adherents as shrill and extreme; over time, they drifted away from the GOP and ended up as Democrats or Independents. In 1944, the year FDR won his fourth term as president, 38% of Americans identified as Republicans; by 2022, that number had dropped to 28%. This demographic cost had ideological consequences. The voters who left were not interchangeable with the ones who stayed. The \"conservatism\" of the old GOP, anchored then in the small towns and cities of the North and Midwest, was really a form of classical, laissez-faire liberalism. It saw public life as transactional, and wanted a state large enough to facilitate those transactions but too small to interfere with them. (In this it inherited the interest of its ancestor, the Whig Party, in \"internal improvements\"\u2014- that is, economic infrastructure.) The post-1964 GOP evolved into a party whose electoral capital is invested in the rural and exurban spaces of the South. (The Party also dominates in some Western states, but they are too sparsely populated to provide much political heft.) Here \"conservatism\" has a much different connotation: it signals a social vision based on hierarchy and exclusion, on the idea that some people, simply by virtue of their identities , are not suited for citizenship. Its politics is not transactional, but existential. It sees social life as a kind of guerilla war in which the \"real\" America must constantly defend itself against outsiders and usurpers who seek to overwhelm it. The burdens of liberal selfhood\u2014 of accepting the presence of creeds, conduct, and beliefs that strike you as absurd, of agreeing to be ruled (depending on the election results) by people whose lives you cannot fathom \u2014 are not easily borne. Donald Trump, with his thinly veiled bigotry and misogyny, is the tribune of this Republican Party. But he did not invent it; he merely inherited it. With the feral insight of a born grifter, he saw very clearly what GOP mandarins by 2016 were unable to see, or at least admit: that their political choices had delivered the Party to voters disgusted and appalled by the very existence of certain kinds of people. It is this sense of threat and dread, this deeply personal shuddering from difference, that I want to explore in what follows. Doing so, I hope, will help us understand the central fact about American politics at this time: how one of our major political parties sold itself to a virulent strain of irrationalism. Liberalism has, to put it bluntly, driven many Republicans insane. But why? ****** Western liberalism arose as a response to two different aspects of modern history: the Protestant Reformation in the sixteenth century and the absolute monarchies that emerged as commercial and demographic change dissolved the feudal world of medieval Europe. These developments, of course, differed greatly in their sources and details, but liberalism's relation to them was roughly the same. In the religious realm, it came to stand for toleration and a removal of sectarian passions from public life. In politics, it sought to replace arbitrary monarchical regimes with representative governments in which power was dispersed and limited by law. The effect, in both cases, was to shelter difference and to accept a public sphere in which plurality was preferred to a coercive unity.

This attempt \u2014 to trade social complexity for social peace \u2014 struck many as doomed to failure. Civilized life is largely life lived with strangers. Critics of liberalism, such as the French authoritarian Joseph de Maistre, drew the necessary conclusion that social peace depends on our ability to cooperate with strangers. But this could only happen, they argued, when we share certain \"essential\" features with them, including a religiously-informed fear of punishment. We might not know our rulers (or many of our fellow citizens) personally, but we could coexist with them on the basis of these common traits and the social trust they create. In their eyes, the liberal quest to conjure political order out of pluralism was quixotic at best and dangerously demented at worst. What modern forms of anti-liberalism such as fascism add to this is more of a tweak than a novelty. For de Maistre and his ilk were always disingenuous in arguing as if their main concern was order and only secondarily who gets to impose it. Definite ideas about who deserves to exercise authority are always in the background of this kind of view; fascism's only contribution was to move it into the foreground. Whether it's defined in cultural/national terms, as in Mussolini's Italy, or in predominantly racial terms, as in Hitler's Germany, the point is always the same: There is some element of the population which, given the specified features, is entitled to wield power over the rest. If they do so, the political regime is ipso facto legitimate; if they do not, it is ipso facto illegitimate. Period. Modern history testifies to the enduring power of this vision of political life. So do the last eight years of American politics. It's easy to dismiss it as a discredited mythology, a remnant of bigotry, intolerance, and hatred. It's easy, because in large part that's exactly what it is. But a credo does not sustain itself over such long periods of time \u2014 especially when competing with even stronger rivals \u2014 without speaking to something large numbers of people find compelling. The demands of liberalism The literary and cultural critic Lionel Trilling is no longer a central presence in American thought, but at the middle of the twentieth century he was the archetypal \"public intellectual,\" a person who work was valued not just by academic colleagues \u2014 Trilling taught English at Columbia University for decades and now has an endowed chair named after him \u2014 but also by that hallowed audience, the \"educated middle class.\" His book The Liberal Imagination , published in 1950, sold over one hundred thousand copies, a previously unheard-of success for a scholarly work. The book includes a famous essay on Henry James's novel The Princess Casamassima . James's book, briefly, follows a young working-class man in late nineteenth-century London as he falls under the spell of a radical organization. Leveraging his horror at the injustices of industrial capitalism, the radicals enlist him to perform a political assassination. But as he moves toward the date of his appointed deed, the young man develops a love for the artistic and cultural achievements of ancien regime Europe, achievements, he understands, that in important ways depended upon the inequalities of wealth he has come to loathe. When the assassin's hour arrives, he is unable to fulfill his promise; he cannot strike down the embodiment of privilege he has been sent to kill because he cannot affirm the broader objective he knows it would symbolize: the death of the social order that enabled the works of art he loves so much. And so he kills himself instead. In Trilling's view, the protagonist's psychology has led him to an impossible choice: He cannot abandon his commitment to social justice, but neither can he renounce his sense of art as something of intense and supreme value. He holds both passions within himself, and his act of suicide is to be understood as signaling his desire for an end to the conditions, personal and cultural, that place these things in tension with each other. For our purposes here, what matters is something Trilling himself does not dilate on: the role of the liberal society of Victorian England in precipitating the protagonist's crisis. The Victorians were, of course, very imperfectly progressive, but their society was visibly moving in a liberal direction. And we can see this in the fact that it readily provided the materials for the experience that drives the hero to suicide \u2014 the experience, that is, of contradiction. The young man looks around himself and sees great wealth side-by-side with great misery; he also absorbs the reforming and radical sentiments the society allows to circulate. At the same time, the world he experiences includes numerous examples of beautiful objects that unjust fortunes have made possible. It is the complexity of a liberal culture\u2014- its social manifestation of visible difference\u2014- that ultimately imposes a demand he cannot reconcile or manage. In a socialist utopia cleansed of ill-gotten gains, or a pure plutocracy without reforming voices, he might have found a simpler, seamless world of less spiritual\u2014- and therefore less lethal\u2014-strain. But it is just this demand\u2014- the requirement that citizens find ways to navigate a social world which will, necessarily, often baffle and horrify them\u2014- that liberal societies must impose. They arise when coercively monolithic social forms come under new pressures that weaken and subvert them. By insisting on a pluralistic regime, they then drive a relentlessly ramifying scene of social complexity. (This is why the late critic Joseph Frank was wrong to argue that Trilling was mistaken in thinking of liberalism as having special connections with complexity.) Citizens must develop habits of thought and feeling that allow an experience of difference as one of the natural facts of democratic life \u2014 not as the perverse evidence of a disordered society. This demand gives the lie to a common misconception of liberalism, namely, that it is an ethic of insouciant self-indulgence, a politics for blithe egoists. In fact, just the opposite is true. The burdens of liberal selfhood\u2014 of accepting the presence of creeds, conduct, and beliefs that strike you as absurd, of agreeing to be ruled (depending on the election results) by people whose lives you cannot fathom \u2014 are not easily borne. They are difficult and strenuous, and the chaos of our own political moment is ample evidence of this. They are, clearly, more than some people can bear. There is a certain kind of personality that is unmoored when it looks at the world and does not see a reflection of itself. And when a politics decides that its main problem is not the management of competing interests, but the very fact of difference itself , then all its solutions must be authoritarian ones. The Princess Casamassima gives us a tender soul crushed by his inability to deal constructively with the visible difference on display in his time and place. Our anti-liberals are not tender. They are, rather, adherents of a social vision that figures large numbers of their fellow citizens as permanent outsiders, as active threats to peace and security who cannot be cooperated with, only dominated. The violence, rhetorical and literal, of the Trumpist Right flows directly from this sense of social life as necessarily and unavoidably coercive. Unlike James's hero, they will not be pointing the gun at themselves when they pull the trigger. Read more about this topic Can't we all get along?

The United States, Saudi Arabia, the European Union, the United Arab Emirates and others will launch plans to link data, railway, ports, electricity networks and hydrogen pipelines across the three regions when they meet on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in New Delhi. Although heavily trade-focused, the plan could spur major political changes. Signatories hope it can help integrate India's vast market of 1.4 billion people with countries to the west, offer a counterbalance to lavish Chinese infrastructure spending, boost Middle Eastern economies and help normalise relations between Israel and Arab Gulf states. The India-Middle East-Europe economic corridor is \"nothing less than historic\", EU leaders are expected to say when the details of the plans are announced. One proposed project would link railway and port facilities across the Middle East -- including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Israel -- potentially speeding trade between India and Europe by up to 40 percent. Pramit Pal Chaudhuri, South Asia practice head at the Eurasia Group, said that a shipping container which today travels from Mumbai, through the Suez Canal to Europe could in the future go by rail from Dubai to Haifa in Israel -- saving both money and time -- and on to Europe. At present the Suez Canal is a major bottleneck to world trade, handling roughly 10 percent of global maritime trade but often beset by disruptions. In March 2021, the giant container ship Ever Given caused a nearly week-long stoppage in Suez traffic after it became lodged diagonally in the waterway. At the same time the plan neatly aligns with several of Washington's goals in the Middle East, and officials say the United States is keen to see the projects take flight. The initiative \"has enormous potential\", according to Jon Finer, US deputy national security advisor. President Joe Biden's administration is actively prodding Riyadh -- a major oil producer and security partner -- to normalise ties with Israel after decades of conflict and closed borders. US involvement could also help mend deeply damaged ties between Riyadh and Washington, which frayed after the US-Iran nuclear deal and the 2018 murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Finer said the public announcement would come after \"months of careful diplomacy, quiet, careful diplomacy, bilaterally and in multilateral settings\". According to details seen by AFP, the India - Middle East - Europe economic corridor would develop infrastructure to enable the production and transport of \"green hydrogen\". It would also strengthen telecommunications and data transfers through a new undersea cable connecting the region. All the projects could also help oil-soaked Middle Eastern states ween their economies off dependence on fossil fuels. Michael Kugelman, South Asia Institute director at The Wilson Center, said the plan could be a significant response to China's much-vaunted Belt and Road Initiative. The so-called BRI has spread Chinese influence, investments and commerce across Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America. \"If finalised, it would be a game changer that strengthens connectivity between India and the Middle East and would aim to counter BRI,\" Kugelman posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u00a9 Copyright AFP 2023.

It is hard to believe that it's been about 15 years since trading in bitcoin began. Crypto has exploded since then, with coins coming and going, not always quietly. IRS guidance from 2014 ( Notice 2014-21 ) says crypto is property, not currency. That means most transfers trigger taxes. You might be using it to pay for a new car, a cup of coffee or paying someone for services, either as an independent contractor or as an employee. But no matter what the transaction, you may have a gain or a loss. Whatever type or amount of crypto you use, the IRS will say you paid them the current market value of the crypto on that day. When you pay an independent contractor and issue a Form 1099, you can't enter a number of bitcoin on the form. You must put the value in U.S. dollars as of the time of payment. The contractor you pay might keep the crypto, or might sell it the same day, but that doesn't impact your taxes. The U.S. Treasury Department has proposed new rules to make it harder for people not to pay tax on their gains when they sell or trade crypto. Starting in 2026 for the 2025 tax year, crypto exchanges are required to report to the IRS and taxpayers in much the way brokerage firms now handle stock trades. The basic idea is that the crypto exchanges will send you and the IRS a Form 1099 keyed to your Social Security Number each year, reporting the total gross proceeds generated on your sales. You already get Form 1099 for many kinds of payments. They usually show up in your mailbox around Jan. 31, for the prior year. And if you receive a Form 1099 but don't put it on your tax return, it usually means that you'll get a tax bill from the IRS asking for their cut. The new reporting rules are not reporting your gain, mind you, but the gross amount in dollars your transactions represent. If you held your crypto for over a year to get long term capital gain treatment on your gains, the IRS tax rate is up to 23.8%. In contrast, if your gain is ordinary, the tax hit is up to 37%. Depending on where you live, you need to consider state taxes too. But how about your tax basis, who keeps track of that? The answer is that you have to. But the IRS and Treasury Department are thinking about this too. In addition to reporting gross proceeds starting in January 2026 for 2025 sales, the crypto exchanges will also have to start reporting your purchase price too\u2014your basis. That will make it even easier for the IRS to send you a tax bill if you forget to report your gain yourself. The new basis reporting kicks in early in 2027, when reporting sales made in 2026. But the rules would reach back only to crypto purchased in 2023 or later. But still, you can probably assume that there will be lots of zero basis reporting as these rules take effect. Is all this shocking? Hardly. The IRS has been after crypto for a long while now, even before 2014. But the IRS has had a hard time coming out with guidance, a hard time training its personnel how to audit crypto, and what to do with questionable cases. What if neither you nor your exchange know your tax basis? Maybe you bought your crypto long ago, and just don't know. Maybe it was a gift from your uncle Joe, but you don't know what he paid for it. Under IRS tax rules, when you receive property by gift, you take a carryover basis, meaning the basis that the giver of the property had. That way, if the person who made the gift has a low basis, you do too\u2014which will yield a bigger tax bite on your gain when you sell it. If your exchange doesn't know your basis, they will likely say zero basis. And that is the IRS rule too. If you can't prove your basis to the IRS, the IRS will assume that your basis is zero. \u00a9 Copyright IBTimes 2023. All rights reserved.

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Geopolitical tensions are triggering an arms race and military modernization, supporting revenue growth in these three best defense stocks. The post The 3 Best Defense Stocks to Buy Now: September 2023 appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Global defense spending hit a record high of $2.24 trillion in 2022. The Russia-Ukraine conflict and East Asia tensions are influencing increases in military expenditure. These geopolitical dynamics spell a favorable operating environment for the best defense stocks . The war in Ukraine has already depleted arms inventories for the U.S. and European nations. As we advance, these defense contractors will enjoy sustained demand. Thus, replacing missiles and other defense systems will support demand from now on. Also, the Russia-Ukraine war has highlighted the vulnerability of European nations and other U.S. allies. After decades of defense spending stagnation, several Western and Central European states significantly boosted their defense spending in 2022. Meanwhile, countries in other regions are increasing their defense budgets to enhance preparedness. For instance, Japan is increasing its defense spending due to rising threats from China and North Korea. These three best defense stocks are in a prime position to benefit from increasing defense budgets. They supply critical defense systems and services that will be in high demand in this volatile geopolitical landscape. Lockheed Martin (LMT) Lockheed Martin\u2019s (NYSE: LMT ), a Maryland-based defense giant, is a critical defense supplier for the U.S. and its allies. The company develops and manufactures advanced military aircraft. In addition, it provides air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems, tactical missiles and air and missile defense systems. Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 program will be a key growth driver. In 2022, the F-35 program accounted for 27% of total sales and 66% of the Aeronautics segment\u2019s net sales. Given the rising U.S.-China tensions, the U.S. and its allies are banking on F35 fighter jets to bolster their defenses. There are reasons for optimism after the debt ceiling deal met President Joe Biden\u2019s $886 billion request for fiscal year 2024. As a result, the F-35 will receive funding to produce 83 F-35 aircraft. Besides, there is increasing interest from allies. For instance, Israel recently approved the purchase of 25 F-35 jets. As orders increase, revenue growth is accelerating. In the second quarter of FY2023 , the aeronautics segment grew sales 17% year-over-year. The increase was mainly due to a rise in production contracts. Looking at the Missiles and Fire Control segment, sales were flat. While the year-over-year growth was disappointing, the backlog trend was positive. The segment recorded a backlog increase of $5.3 billion to close the quarter at $34 billion. With a record backlog and growing revenues, the company is in a strong position to return capital to shareholders. It has a strong record of shareholder returns, having repurchased 21% of its outstanding shares in the last 10 years. Additionally, it has increased its dividend for 20 consecutive years. RTX Corporation (RTX) Considering that RTX Corporation (NYSE: RTX ) is near 52-week lows, it might be an opportunity to buy one of the best defense stocks. After announcing its second-quarter results, the stock declined by over 10%. The negative reaction was triggered by an issue with its Pratt & Whitney engines . Reuters reported that RTX had discovered a defect in 1,200 engines. Microscopic contaminants in the powdered metal in high-pressure turbine discs could cause micro-cracks. As a result, the affected engines must be grounded for inspection over the next year. This was a setback for the company\u2019s ambition to conquer the jet engine market. But looking at the rest of the second quarter report , the results were impressive. Sales were up 12% YOY and 13% on an organic basis. The Collins Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney and Raytheon Missiles & Defense segments reported 17%, 15% and 12% YOY growth rates, respectively. Meanwhile, the total backlog was a healthy $185 billion \u2014 $112 billion commercial and $73 billion defense. Net income from continuing operations was 1.3 billion, a 2% YOY increase. Additionally, adjusted EPS grew 11% YOY to $1.29. The company also repurchased $596 million of RTX shares in the quarter. Management highlighted the strong momentum and raised their outlook. \u201cBased on the strong performance year-to-date and strong end-markets, we are raising our full year sales outlook and tightening our adjusted EPS* outlook,\u201d said CEO Greg Hayes. For FY2023, management expects adjusted EPS of $4.95 \u2013 $5.05. Considering a midpoint EPS of 5, the stock trades at 16 times forward price-to-earnings. Buy the world\u2019s largest aerospace and defense company at these bargain prices. CACI International (CACI) CACI International (NYSE: CACI ) offers specialized technology services and consulting to the defense and intelligence industry. It is a beneficiary of the modernization efforts in the U.S. military and intelligence. Moreover, it will profit from the increased cyber warfare as we go ahead. The company provides digital solutions that modernize federal agencies and their IT. The Engineering Services segment enhances and hardens national technology systems to defend against malicious actors. Its C4ISR, Cyber & Space solutions provide electromagnetic spectrum advantage and deliver precision effects to protect federal agencies against national security threats. CACI generates a significant portion of revenues from the federal government. In fiscal 2023, federal government contracts made up 94.8% of total revenues. Over the same period, contracts with agencies of the Department of Defense represented 71.9% of total revenues. Over the past decade, revenues have been steadily increasing, given the growth in defense spending. This growth will likely continue due to the critical nature of CACI\u2019s services to the U.S. government. The company has secured key defense contracts from the U.S. government. For instance, it won a $5.7 billion Air Force Enterprise IT contract in June to modernize and transform Airforce IT services. And in August, it bagged another $2.7 billion contract from the National Security Agency. These awards highlight why CACI is one of the best defense stocks to buy. In terms of valuations, the stock is reasonably valued. For the full year ending June 30, 2023 , it earned an adjusted diluted EPS of $18.83. Thus, as of this writing, it trades at 17 times trailing earnings. Given the stability of its defense business and expected secular defense spending, CACI stock is a bargain.

        "content": "The BRICS nations met this past August to discuss expansion as well as adding new members to the bloc. Amid de-dollarization efforts and the rising prominence of BRICS, some worry that could destroy the US economy. Specifically, as the collective grows in prominence, and takes aim at the US Dollar, the US could be facing certain economic outcomes and obstacles. The US dollar has been firmly entrenched as the global reserve currency since World War II. However, the rise of BRICS has brought a potential end to that reign. With the BRICS currency growing in talks, and many countries worldwide looking to end their reliance on the greenback, the US dollar may be growing weaker. Dave Ramsey, host of The Ramsey Show, recently spoke on the growing threat from BRICS to the US Economy. Saudi Arabia, one of the newest members of BRICS, dropping the US Dollar is broken for two key reasons, according to Ramsey. First of all, he told his listeners, \u201cThe Saudis are probably way too smart to think they\u2019re going to undermine the U.S. economy.\u201d These countries, which represent 40% of the global population, are reliant on the U.S. economy and its vast consumer market, Ramsey argued. Therefore, he says destroying the U.S. would destroy BRICS in the process. Secondly, \u201cthe idea that you can get all those communists to line up and not shoot each other is gonna be humorous,\u201d he added. Hypothetically, Can BRICS Destroy the US Economy? There have been tensions in the , so while the latter point is rather extreme, there is logic behind it. The US economy has reigned supreme as one of the most influential in the world for decades. Hypothetically, a collapse of the dollar would lead to even more inflation in the US. Subsequently, a decrease in its value would follow, which could be dangerous for the citizens of the country. Prices across the country would increase, which would impact Americans already battling inflation. Alternatively, macroeconomic circumstances are already presenting a fragile economic outlook for the country. Along with potential debt default, the country\u2019s financial situation is becoming increasingly volatile. BRICS can be a factor in causing these issues to occur, however, that worst-case scenario would take a lot of time to come true. The US Economy is currently just as much a danger to itself as BRICS is, and it\u2019s unlikely that BRICS is about to destroy it.",

        "description": "The U.S. government has begun an official probe into an advanced made-in-China chip housed within Huawei Technologies Co.'s latest smartphone, as tensions flare between the two superpowers over technological prowess.",
        "content": "September 8, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked reputable news agency proofread by Mackenzie Hawkins, Bloomberg News The U.S. government has begun an official probe into an advanced made-in-China chip housed within Huawei Technologies Co.'s latest smartphone, as tensions flare between the two superpowers over technological prowess. The Commerce Department, which enacted a series of restrictions against Huawei and China's chip industry over the past two years, said it's working to get more information on a \"purported\" 7-nanometer processor discovered within the Mate 60 Pro. The chip was made by China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., which like Huawei is blacklisted by the U.S. and restricted from accessing American technology. The discovery of the chip set off a debate in Washington about the efficacy of sanctions intended to contain a geopolitical rival and coincided with a move in China to expand a ban on the use of iPhones in government-backed agencies and state companies. The U.S. has been trying to throttle China's tech sector for years amid concerns in Washington that it will gain a military edge. China, which has bristled at the restrictions, has its own fears about the use of foreign technology in sensitive industries and has been seeking to reduce its reliance on American software and circuitry. Clamping down on the iPhone threatens to erode Apple Inc.'s position in a market that yields about a fifth of its revenue and where it produces the majority of its star product. Apple has lost about $200 billion of market value in the past two days, adding to a litany of concerns over China weighing on major U.S. indexes. The shares were little changed in premarket trading in New York on Friday. Huawei's quiet reveal of a mobile phone utilizing technology the U.S. has sought to keep out of Beijing's hands threatens to derail recent efforts of outreach by the Biden administration. The Huawei phone went on sale online while Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was on a trip to China last week, the latest in a series of high-level diplomatic visits to Beijing. The debate now centers around whether it represents a failure of U.S. efforts\u2014led by Raimondo's department\u2014and has raised questions about whether the main U.S. mechanisms to rein in China, including controls on exports of key materials, tools and knowhow, need to be tightened. \"We are working to obtain more information on the character and composition of the purported 7nm chip,\" a Commerce spokesperson said in a statement. \"Let's be clear: export controls are just one tool in the U.S. government's toolbox to address the national security threats presented by the PRC. The restrictions in place since 2019 have knocked Huawei down and forced it to reinvent itself\u2014at a substantial cost to the PRC government.\" Chinese semiconductor equipment makers soared as much as 20% after news of the U.S. probe spurred bets that the sector will enjoy increased state support. That advance was mostly led by companies related to lithography gear\u2014a weak link in China's chip supply chain and one Beijing is keen to develop. Shanghai Electric Group Co., whose controlling shareholder has a major stake in lithography specialist Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment Group Co., rose by its 10% limit. \"We have always opposed politicizing trade and technology issues and overstretching and abusing the concept of national security,\" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters at a regular briefing in Beijing Friday. \"Sanctions will not stop China's development, it will only strengthen China's resolve and capability to seek self-reliance and technology innovation.\" The Mate 60 Pro smartphone employs an unusually high proportion of Chinese parts, in addition to its main processor, an ongoing teardown by TechInsights conducted for Bloomberg News revealed, a sign of the country's progress in developing domestic tech capabilities. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has said he would withhold comment until the U.S. gets more information. \"There's a number of different methods to try to sort of come to an understanding of what exactly it is that we're dealing with here,\" Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday. \"I can't give you an exact number of days but this is not going to be months down the road. We're going to want to look at this carefully, consult with our partners, get a clearer sense of what we're looking at, and then we'll make decisions accordingly. \" In the meantime, Huawei's new devices have spurred an outpouring of nationalist sentiment on Chinese social media, which portrayed them as a triumph in the face of U.S. sanctions. On Friday, Huawei debuted an even more powerful smartphone\u2014the Mate 60 Pro+\u2014in an online video teaser. The Pro+ adds a 1-terabyte maximum storage option and 4GB more memory than on the Pro model, which retails at 6,999 yuan. Shares of Huawei suppliers soared as much as their 10% daily limit on Chinese exchanges after that latest offering hit online stores. 2023 Bloomberg L.P. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

Mitt Romney (R-UT) for colluding with the \u201cMcConnell-Schumer cabal\u201d during an appearance on Sirius XM\u2019s Breitbart News Saturday . Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle noted that after Staggs blasted Romney in a July interview for not spending much time in Utah, Romney has recently begun events in his home state. LISTEN : \u201cWe, the power of Breitbart, and your program here and just calling him out because that has been a great concern,\u201d Staggs told Boyle. \u201cThe voting record is one thing, and so many Utahns are just completely opposede Jhe to his policies and the support of that Biden agenda.\u201d Staggs said it is \u201cquite ironic\u201d that Romney \u201csuddenly\u201d showed up in Utah. Boyle then mentioned that Utah Sen. Mike Lee (R) called for new Republican leadership in the Senate and asked Staggs if he supports Lee\u2019s position. \u201cI agree. 100 percent,\u201d Staggs said about wanting new Republican leadership in the Senate. \u201cI support Mike Lee in this and you\u2019re right. He\u2019s just been fantastic. He\u2019s exhibited leadership. It\u2019s what we need. I mean, we need adults in Washington, DC, that that are more interested in advancing the interests of the American public\u2014 those whom they\u2019re supposed to represent\u2014than going out there and trying to perpetuate the status quo \u2013 the establishment that unfortunately, they have demonstrated they represent,\u201d Staggs said.

We can\u2019t just let the government shut down.\u2019 And, and you just lose all your negotiating leverage day one,\u201d Staggs said. \u201cWe need some true leaders. Mike Lee, Senator Lee has demonstrated that on this issue.\u201d Staggs said Romney \u201cjust hasn\u2019t demonstrated leadership where it needs to be in pushing back against the establishment changing the status quo so it actually improves the lot of everyday Americans.\u201d \u201cSo I don\u2019t expect that we\u2019ll see anything other than him continuing to collude with, yes, sadly, the McConnell-Schumer, Cabal,\u201d Staggs said of Romney.

        "description": "Donald Trump stopped at a fraternity house before heading to watch the Iowa-Iowa State football game",
        "content": "AMES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump stepped out of a fraternity house to the cheers of hundreds of Iowa State University students and tossed autographed footballs into the crowd. \u201cI guess the youth likes Trump,\u201d he said over the cheers of the students, speaking to the Right Side Broadcasting Network, which supports his candidacy. Then, the former president entered a motorcade to head to a private stadium suite where he watched the school's annual football grudge match Saturday with the University of Iowa. The pregame campus stop was a reminder of Trump's dominant position atop a crowded Republican field both in Iowa and nationally. Several of his rivals also attended the game, mingling with fans at pregame tailgates outside the stadium. But Trump got by far the most attention and hasn't paid a price yet for skipping the closer interactions with voters that are a cherished Iowa political tradition. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has struggled to position himself as a potent foe to Trump, came to Ames to attend the game with Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has not endorsed a candidate but often has appeared with DeSantis and his wife, Casey. As he moved from one tailgate to another, DeSantis was flanked by fans cheering and waving campaign signs from a booth hosted by the pro-DeSantis Never Back Down super PAC. \u201cWe\u2019re having a good time,\u201d DeSantis told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s quite an atmosphere, probably a little bit more civilized than the Florida-Georgia game.\u201d Trump has made a habit of visiting Iowa on the same day as DeSantis, whom Trump treats as his main threat. Their dynamic Saturday was similar to last month when Trump drew huge crowds to the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines while DeSantis addressed smaller audiences and hit the midway rides with his family. At the Alpha Gamma Rho house, students tried to photograph Trump as he worked the crowd outside the red-brick fraternity house and flipped hamburgers at the grill. There were some insults during the day. Some fans walking the streets made profane gestures at his motorcade as it moved through Ames. Prop planes flew over the stadium carrying a banner that read, \u201cWhere's Melania?\u201d The former first lady has been largely absent from the campaign so far. And hired performers wearing inflatable costumes, one posing as Trump and the other infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, held hands as they roamed the parking lot in face masks. Also appearing before the game were candidates Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor, and Asa Hutchinson, a former Arkansas governor, who greeted each other at a tailgate honoring veterans, where Sen. Joni Ernst camped out for most of the afternoon. While fans showed up Saturday for football, not politics, voters have had the chance to see most candidates who regularly appear at Iowa cattle calls and meet-and-greets. DeSantis is increasingly focused on winning or placing high in Iowa and says he's visited more than half of the state's 99 counties already. Trump, meanwhile, had made only six visits to Iowa this year before Saturday. Still, his campaign has been working in his absence, promising a more disciplined, data-driven effort for the organizational-heavy caucuses than his first campaign in 2016, when he finished second to Ted Cruz. Trump\u2019s campaign set up several booths around the parking lots, with his volunteers working to get fans to sign caucus pledge cards. He sat at the game with Iowa casino powerhouse Gary Kirke, an influential Republican donor. Trump waved at fans from the window of a skybox, though he entertained visitors who were allowed in and out before he left the game during the third quarter. Last week, Trump held a conference call with tens of thousands of Iowans. And he has done some face-to-face stops in Iowa with voters. In June, he handed out Dairy Queen \u201cBlizzards\" while also confessing aloud that he did not know what the soft-serve treats were. There is no comparable example in Iowa political history to a former president running to reclaim his old office while also under indictment for more than 90 felony counts. But other high-profile candidates and strong front-runners have done the town halls and retail campaigning for which Iowa and other early primary states are well-known. In 2007, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton entered the race for the 2008 Democratic nomination as a national celebrity and the party's heavy favorite in national polling. Drawing larger crowds, Clinton sought to meet the demand by holding smaller meetings with local activists before speaking to packed gyms and halls. Clinton also attended party events with her lesser-known rivals to demonstrate her willingness to undergo the rigor that Iowans typically demand. Ultimately, she lost the 2008 caucus to then-Sen. , who eventually won the nomination and the White House. Trump has foregone all but one such event in Iowa this year. The exception was the Iowa Republican Party Lincoln Dinner in July, a marquee event that helps to finance the caucus.",

        "content": "The IRS announced it will start targeting thousands of uber-wealthy tax cheats and make them poney up hundreds of millions of dollars in the coming months. The federal agency said it plans to aggressively hunt down 1,600 millionaires and 75 large business partnerships that routinely \u201ccut corners\u201d on their taxes. \u201cIf you pay your taxes on time it should be particularly frustrating when you see that wealthy filers are not,\u201d IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel said. Each of the millionaire tax dodgers that the IRS set its sights on owes a minimum of at least $250,000 each in back taxes, while the partnerships have assets of roughly $10 billion on average. The IRS is planning to hire an undisclosed number of revenue agents to focus on the high-end collection cases so that the new initiative can start rolling in October this year. The crackdown represents the next phase of an offensive pursuit that the Biden Administration launched earlier this summer \u2014 in July, the IRS said it collected $38 million in delinquent taxes from more than 175 high-income taxpayers in the span of a few months. According to Werfel, the initiative is being propelled by a massive boost in federal funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to generate tax revenue for the nation. The agency is also being added by artificial intelligence tools that can detect tax-cheating tactics that might be indiscernible to the human eye. \u201cNew tools are helping us see patterns and trends that we could not see before, and as a result, we have higher confidence on where to look and find where large partnerships are shielding income,\u201d Werfel said. A team of academic economists and IRS researchers in 2021 found that the top 1% of U.S. income earners fail to report more than 20% of their earnings to the IRS. With additional support and funding, the IRS will continue to hunt larger and wealthier tax dodgers in the coming years. As part of the initiative, the agency promised that citizens earning less than $400,000 a year will not see an increase in their audit rates. \u201cThis new compliance push makes good on the promise of the Inflation Reduction Act to ensure the IRS holds our wealthiest filers accountable to pay the full amount of what they owe,\u201d said Werfel. \u201cThe years of underfunding that predated the Inflation Reduction Act led to the lowest audit rate of wealthy filers in our history.\u201d With Post Wires",

Harris tried to sing along to the Billboard chart-topper but didn\u2019t appear to know the words besides the chorus. Ultimately, the second-in-command settled on a simple dance pattern \u2014 waving one hand in the air while sashaying from one foot to the other. Some online wags saw a clip of the VP\u2019s footwork and couldn\u2019t resist the opportunity to lambaste the dancing Democrat for enjoying a music-related party while the country deals with a plethora of issues, including inflation and the wake of the devastating Maui fires. \u201cDance Kamala as Hawaiians are still lamenting, baby!\u201d one X user said. \u201cHer dance moves are on a par with her skill level in dealing with our border crisis,\u201d wrote another. One critic blasted the politician with a simple, yet devastating nickname: \u201cKringemala Harris.\u201d The wince-worthy moves were not the first time Harris displayed that generated long-lasting Internet chatter. She was relentlessly mocked in June after Bravo host Andy Cohen released a clip of her stiffly leaning back and bopping her head as he showed her Kylie Minogue\u2019s song \u201cPadum.\u201d \u201cI like it, I like it!\u201d she said before devolving into cackles.",

        "content": "On Labor Day, Eric Levine, a New York lawyer and Republican fundraiser, sent an email to roughly 1,500 donors, politicians and friends. \"I refuse to accept the proposition that Donald Trump is the 'inevitable' Republican nominee for President,\" he wrote. \"His nomination would be a disaster for our party and our country.\" Many of the Republican Party's wealthiest donors share that view and the growing sense of urgency about the state of the GOP presidential primary race. Trump's grip on the party's voters is as powerful as ever, with polls in Iowa and New Hampshire last month putting him at least 25 percentage points above his nearest rivals. That has left major Republican donors \u2014 whose desires have increasingly diverged from those of conservative voters \u2014 grappling with the reality that the tens of millions of dollars they have spent to try to stop the former president, fearing he poses a mortal threat to their party and the country, may be a sunk cost. Interviews with more than a dozen Republican donors and their allies revealed hand-wringing, magical thinking, calls to arms and, for some, fatalism. Several of them did not want to be identified by name out of a fear of political repercussions or a desire to stay in the good graces of any eventual Republican nominee, including Trump. \"If things don't change quickly, people are going to despair,\" Levine said in an interview. He is among the optimists who believe Trump's support is not as robust as the polls suggest and who see a quickly closing window to rally behind another candidate. In Levine's 2,500-word Labor Day missive, he urged his readers to pick Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina. Other schools of thought exist. Some donors have backed Trump's rivals despite believing that he is unbeatable in the primaries. These donors are banking, in part, on the chance that Trump will eventually drop out of the race because of his legal troubles, a health scare or some other personal or political calculation. Fred Zeidman, a Texas businessperson who is an enthusiastic backer of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, said he had given her a blunt assessment of her prospects last month. \"You're at 2%, and he's at 53%,\" he recalled telling her, in only a slight exaggeration of Trump's polling advantage. \"He ain't going to erode that much. Something needs to happen to him for you to overtake him.\" Privately, many donors said that the primary contest so far \u2014 especially the first Republican debate last month, in which Trump did not take part \u2014 had felt like a dress rehearsal for a play that would never happen. One donor's political adviser called it \"the kids' table.\" One Texas-based Republican fundraiser, who has not committed to a candidate and insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations, said he regularly told major donors that, like it or not, Trump would be the nominee. \"Intellectually, their heads explode,\" the fundraiser said. He said many donors were \"backing off\" rather than supporting a candidate, reflecting a fundamental belief that nobody can defeat Trump. Large-dollar Republican donors, even those who enthusiastically or reluctantly backed Trump in 2016 and 2020, have made no secret of their wish to move on in 2024. Some big donors have stuck with Trump, though not nearly as many as in past cycles, at least not so far; a super political action committee backing Trump has reported just 25 contributions of $100,000 or more. They include $2 million from casino magnate Phil Ruffin and $1 million from former real estate developer Charles Kushner, father of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. Trump pardoned the elder Kushner on his way out of office. Major donors, particularly those in the tier just below the billionaire power players, have seen their influence wane in recent elections, a trend inextricably bound up in Trump's continued hold on Republican voters. The explosive growth of small-dollar contributions \u2014 a phenomenon that, on the Republican side, has overwhelmingly favored Trump \u2014 reflects a widening disconnect between voters' sympathies and the interests of big donors. Conservative commentator Bill Kristol, who has become a pariah in his party over his long-standing opposition to Trump, said he told donors and their advisers at the beginning of the year that if they were serious about defeating Trump, they had to spend money in a concerted effort to convince Republican voters that he should not be the nominee. The hope was that by Labor Day, Trump's poll numbers would be in the 30s, Kristol explained. Instead, he said, \"they've done nothing, and Trump is at 50%.\" Kristol said he was not sure if donors had a kind of \"learned helplessness\" or if they were just wary of offending Trump and his supporters. \"I think, ultimately, they tell themselves they could live with him,\" he said. \"We know what a world would look like if real conservative elites really decided they wanted to get rid of Donald Trump,\" Kristol said. \"And that's not the world we are living in.\" If there was any hope among big donors that the various investigations into Trump would undermine his popular support, such dreams have faded. Each successive indictment \u2014 four since late March \u2014 has brought waves of financial contributions and new energy to his poll numbers. Some donors expressed incredulity that Trump would be able to run for president while fighting off the charges. He faces a busy calendar of trials next year that is likely to grow only more complex. \"I don't see how he's going to deal with these huge legal problems,\" said Long Island-based metals magnate Andy Sabin, who is backing Scott. \"I don't really care about his numbers. I think he's got enough other stuff going on. All of these trials start \u2014 who knows? We are in uncharted territory.\" Sabin conceded that Trump had a \"very solid base,\" adding that he would \"almost have to murder somebody\" for people to turn on him. \"People think he's God.\" Many major donors, even those who believe Trump committed crimes and who think his actions surrounding Jan. 6, 2021, were abhorrent, said they believed the indictments were politically motivated. Some also suggested that the indictments had temporarily inflated his poll numbers by keeping him in the news and fueling voter outrage on his behalf. \"I fundamentally believe Trump's numbers are artificial,\" said Jay Zeidman, a Texas-based health care investor and major fundraiser for Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida (and the son of Fred Zeidman). \"I'm not saying they are making them up; I don't think there's real strength behind those numbers.\" He continued, \"I think you have to be patient and let the gravity of the situation he's in take hold. This election is not about vindicating one man. This is not a referendum on Trump.\" Zeidman, like others, said he believed Trump would lose the presidential race and drag down Republican candidates for Senate and the House. \"I believe that Republican primary voters need to understand the opportunity they have to win a very winnable presidential election.\" Dan Eberhart, a private equity and energy executive who is also backing DeSantis, said that he expected Trump's legal troubles to weigh him down, and that he believed most voters were looking for a second choice. \"By the time Super Tuesday comes around, Trump is going to have been beaten in Iowa, and the dam is going to burst,\" he predicted. \"Once someone else is viable, I think you're going to see him quickly melt.\" Then, Eberhart said, donors who have not committed to a candidate will come out of the woodwork: \"They are actively holding their breath, wanting a solution to Trump but not knowing what it is.\" As some donors have cast about for a late entrant to the race who could challenge Trump, the name that comes up most often is Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia. Levine addressed the Youngkin question in his essay, saying, \"Waiting for someone else to get into the race is not an option.\" (Youngkin has not ruled out a run and has said he is focused on Virginia's state legislative elections this fall; with each passing day, the logistical barriers to entry grow higher.) Bill Bean, an Indiana-based real estate executive and backer of former Vice President Mike Pence, said the field would narrow until there was a \"clear alternative\" to Trump. Bean backed Trump's reelection campaign in 2020 and supported the policy decisions he made as president. \"But I would like to see us move forward,\" he said. \"I want to look at the future in a positive way. I hear that a lot more than maybe the poll numbers show.\" This article originally appeared in The New York Times .",

(Sep)NOTE: Previews are listed in day orderNORWEGIAN CPI (MON): The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced.UK UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES (TUE): Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end.UK GDP ESTIMATE (WED): A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought.US CPI (WED): Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern.ECB ANNOUNCEMENT (THU): 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%.AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYMENT (THU): participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms.SWEDISH CPIF (THU): July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak.US RETAIL SALES (THU): Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July. While the data set will offer a glimpse on the health of the consumer amid concerns that the economy may slow significantly in the months ahead, traders will also be watching the University of Michigan's prelim survey release due Friday, where the rise in energy prices is likely to have weighed on sentiment.CHINESE ACTIVITY DATA (FRI): Retail sales Y/Y in August are expected to rise by 2.8% (prev. 2.5%), whilst there is currently no consensus for Industrial Production metrics. The data will be closely watched to diagnose the health of the world\u2019s second-larger economy and to gauge the drip-feed of stimulus seen over recent weeks. Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d.This article originally appeared on Newsquawk This article was written by Newsquawk Analysis at www.forexlive.com.",

For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%. : participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms. : July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak. : Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July. While the data set will offer a glimpse on the health of the consumer amid concerns that the economy may slow significantly in the months ahead, traders will also be watching the University of Michigan's prelim survey release due Friday, where the rise in energy prices is likely to have weighed on sentiment. : Retail sales Y/Y in August are expected to rise by 2.8% (prev. 2.5%), whilst there is currently no consensus for Industrial Production metrics. The data will be closely watched to diagnose the health of the world\u2019s second-larger economy and to gauge the drip-feed of stimulus seen over recent weeks. Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d. This article originally appeared on",

        "description": "Starfield is one of the biggest games on Steam right now.",
        "content": "Bethesda Game Studios has finally released Starfield , after years of anticipation from Xbox and PC fans. And as you would expect, it's a big hit. In fact, according to Bethesda , it surpassed six million players at release, making it the biggest launch of its history . Of course, it being included with an Xbox Game Pass subscription means this number is inflated. While there's no denying this bit of marketing is a tad misleading, there's also no denying its a major win for Xbox. Further, it's one of the most popular games on Steam right now alongside the likes of Counter-Strike , Dota 2 , and Baldur's Gate 3 . In the past 24 hours, Starfield concurrent players on Steam peaked at 313,993. This was a new time all-time high for it and it remains the high for the space-faring RPG. This is only enough for it to take the number four spot on the Steam concurrent players chart, behind the aforementioned games. However, while it's come up short against some modern competitors, it's enough to top some of its historical competition. Emphasis on some. More specifically, with 313,993 concurrent players, the game soared past Skyrim's peak 12 years ago when it achieved 287,411 concurrent players. Of course, Steam wasn't as popular back then. In other words, there's a very good chance if Skyrim was released today it would blitz 313,993 concurrent players. Evidence of this is Fallout 4 , which achieved 472,962 concurrent players eight years ago. Yet again, while Steam's increase in popularity works in the favor of Starfield , what doesn't is the fact it's available on Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass PC. When the other two Bethesda Game Studios games released, Xbox Game Pass didn't even exist. This is no doubt stealing a considerable number of players away from playing on Steam. What remains to be seen is how well Starfield will maintain this player base over time. Will it be more like Skyrim , which is still relevant 12 years later or will it be more like Fallout 4 , which felt like it came and went? It's too early to tell, but the new Xbox game is off to a good start. That said, with games like Mortal Kombat 1 , Marvel's Spider-Man 2 , Alan Wake 2 , and more looming it may find it hard to maintain this good start. 0 comments",

Trump visited Jack Trice Stadium in Ames, where Iowa State was playing Iowa. Also on hand were Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and several other lesser-known candidates.

        "content": "AMES, Iowa \u2014 Donald Trump crossed paths with several Republican rivals Saturday as he attended Iowa\u2019s in-state college football grudge match, one of the former president\u2019s few visits so far to the state that holds the first nominating caucus next year. Trump waded into one of the state\u2019s largest sports crowds at Jack Trice Stadium in Ames, where Iowa State was hosting Iowa. Also at the game were Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and several other candidates, putting in face time with Iowa\u2019s elected officials and football fans. With the race entering its traditional ramp-up after Labor Day, Trump has largely skipped holding town halls or participating in many of the state\u2019s cherished campaign traditions, but has not paid a price so far. Trump remains far ahead of DeSantis and other rivals in Iowa and nationally. Trump has made a habit of visiting Iowa on the same day as DeSantis, whom Trump treats as his main threat. Both were in and around the stadium before kickoff, reminiscent of the scene last month when Trump drew huge crowds to the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines while DeSantis addressed smaller audiences and hit the midway rides with his family. Trump on Saturday emerged from the Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity, an agricultural house in the middle of Iowa State\u2019s fraternity and sorority neighborhood, where he met privately with students first, to the cheers of hundreds pressing to get photos with the former president outside the red-brick house. Trump basked in the adoration, pumping his fists to the chants of \u201cTrump, Trump, Trump\u201d and \u201cU.S.A, U.S.A.\u201d before strolling to a grill and raising a spatula holding a hamburger. He stopped to autograph photos and about a dozen footballs, which he tossed, both underhand and overhand, into the crowd of cheering students before departing for the game. During the fraternity scrum, Trump approached a reporter with the Republican-leaning Right Side Broadcasting Network, who asked what he thought of the scene. \u201cI guess the youth likes Trump,\u201d Trump said, straining to be heard above the din of the crowd. Trump endured some targeted hits during the day. As Trump\u2019s motorcade rolled on to the college campus before game time, some football fans walking the streets of Ames to the game made profane gestures as it passed. A prop plane flew over the stadium carrying a banner that read, \u201cWhere\u2019s Melania?\u201d And hired performers wearing inflatable costumes, one posing as Trump and the other infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, held hands as they roamed the parking lot in face masks. Meanwhile, DeSantis met fans of both schools at tailgates and said he would be attending the game with Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has not endorsed a candidate but often has appeared with DeSantis and his wife, Casey. \u201cWe\u2019re having a good time,\u201d DeSantis said to reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s quite an atmosphere, probably a little bit more civilized than the Florida-Georgia game.\u201d As he wandered from one tailgate to another, DeSantis was flanked by fans cheering and waving campaign signs from a booth hosted by the pro-DeSantis Never Back Down super PAC. Volunteers with Iowans for Trump similarly set up several booths around the parking lots, with both teams working to get fans to sign caucus pledge cards. Also appearing before the game were candidates Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor, and Asa Hutchinson, a former Arkansas governor, who greeted each other at a tailgate honoring veterans, where Sen. Joni Ernst camped out for most of the afternoon. Asked who he was rooting for, DeSantis said he wasn\u2019t going to \u201cdo anything to upset\u201d Reynolds, who is an Iowa State graduate. Hutchinson said he was rooting for the \u201cunderdog because I\u2019m an underdog in this race and I want underdogs to win,\u201d and Burgum noted his North Dakota State Bison were playing today, though he didn\u2019t risk showing up in Ames wearing his gear. While fans Saturday showed up for football, not for politics, voters have had the chance to see most candidates who regularly appear at Iowa cattle calls and meet-and-greets. DeSantis is increasingly focused on winning or placing high in Iowa and says he\u2019s visited more than half of the state\u2019s 99 counties already. Trump, meanwhile, has made only five visits to Iowa this year. At the game, Trump was sitting in a stadium suite with Iowa casino powerhouse Gary Kirke, an influential Republican donor. Instead of large-scale rallies, Trump is relying on state party events that offer large, friendly audiences at no cost to his campaign, while his political organization pays millions of dollars in legal expenses as he faces four criminal indictments. He was in neighboring South Dakota on Friday night appearing at a state party fundraiser with Gov. Kristi Noem, who endorsed him. Trump\u2019s campaign has also used digital outreach. Last week, Trump held a conference call with tens of thousands of Iowans. He has done some in-person events with voters. In June, he handed out Dairy Queen \u201cBlizzards\u201d while also confessing aloud that he did not know what the soft-serve treats were. There is no comparable example in Iowa political history to a former president running to reclaim his old office while also under indictment for more than 90 felony counts. But other high-profile candidates and strong front-runners have done the town halls and retail campaigning for which Iowa and other early primary states are well-known. In 2007, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton entered the race for the 2008 Democratic nomination as a national celebrity and the party\u2019s heavy favorite in national polling. Drawing larger crowds, Clinton sought to meet the demand by holding smaller meetings with local activists before speaking to packed gyms and halls. Clinton also attended party events with her lesser-known rivals to demonstrate her willingness to undergo the rigor that Iowans typically demand. Ultimately, she lost the 2008 caucus to then-Sen. Barack Obama, who eventually won the nomination and the White House. Trump has foregone all but one such event in Iowa this year. The exception was the Iowa Republican Party Lincoln Dinner in July, a marquee event that helps to finance the caucus.",

Christie, who's competing alongside Trump for the GOP nomination, didn't hold back in questioning the former president's priorities. \"Donald Trump wants to debate Meghan Markle but not his opponents?

        "description": "US President Biden and Vietnam's Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong expected to agree new partnership.",
        "content": "Just days ahead of US President Joe Biden\u2019s visit to Vietnam for key talks on trade and closer diplomatic relations, the president paid homage to events from an earlier and very different time \u2013 At the White House on Tuesday, Biden presented the Medal of Honor, the United States military\u2019s highest award, to 81-year-old Larry Taylor, a retired army captain who had flown a Cobra attack helicopter during the Under fire, out of fuel, and disregarding orders to return to base with his two-seater helicopter, Taylor persisted and saved the lives of four American soldiers who were surrounded by approximately 100 Vietnamese fighters. Taylor\u2019s actions \u201crewrote the fate of four families for generations to come\u201d, Biden said at the award ceremony. When Biden lands at Hanoi\u2019s Noi Bai International Airport on Sunday, he steps into a very different Vietnam and a phenomenally changed relationship with an old war foe. Biden is scheduled to meet the most senior leaders of Vietnam\u2019s Communist Party \u2013 the political organisation that was once an enemy \u2013 and is expected to sign agreements that elevate US relations to the highest level possible with Hanoi. \u201cThis visit is a remarkable step in the strengthening of our diplomatic ties,\u201d US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said ahead of the visit. \u201cIt reflects the leading role that Vietnam will play in our growing network of partnerships in the Indo-Pacific,\u201d Sullivan said. Both countries, he also said, had laboured to overcome the \u201cpainful shared legacy\u201d of the war, which resulted in the deaths of millions of Vietnamese and 58,000 US service members. While diplomatic ties and trade are foremost in the scheduled meeting between Biden and Vietnam\u2019s most powerful figure, Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, Washington also has its eyes set on China, which is increasingly in the Asia Pacific region. China will be watching Biden\u2019s visit closely, too, weakens Beijing\u2019s influence in Hanoi or alters strategic interests with its southern neighbour. Vietnam and the US are already signatories to a \u201ccomprehensive partnership\u201d, and speculation has focused on the elevation of relations to the highest level of a \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership\u201d \u2013 the most senior level in Vietnam\u2019s diplomatic hierarchy, said Le Hong Hiep, senior fellow and coordinator of the Vietnam Studies Programme at the ISEAS \u2013 Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. If that were to occur during Biden\u2019s visit, it would \u201crepresent a remarkable breakthrough in bilateral ties\u201d, Hiep wrote recently in the ISEAS Fulcrum online magazine. Vietnam \u201conly forms such partnerships with those that it views as of great importance for its security, prosperity, and international standing,\u201d Hiep said. If the agreement is signed, Vietnam will be inviting Washington into a club of just four other comprehensive strategic partners: China, India, Russia, and South Korea. While concerns over a backlash from China are credible, upgrading ties to such a level with the US at this time \u201cmakes perfect sense\u201d for several reasons, Hiep said. Washington\u2019s commitment to keeping the Indo-Pacific maritime area free and open aligns with Vietnam\u2019s interests amid China\u2019s regional muscle flexing. The US is also Vietnam\u2019s second largest trading partner (after China), but the US is, importantly, the largest export market for Vietnamese goods. As Hiep notes, it would be a \u201csensible move for Hanoi\u201d to have closer ties with such an important business partner. Timing is also important. It would be better to make the move to elevate ties with Washington now, before US-China competition sours even further, which could place Vietnam in a more tenuous situation when it came to making such a choice. Nevertheless, closer ties with the US do not mark a major shift in Vietnam\u2019s \u201cstrategic trajectory\u201d, as it is in Hanoi\u2019s best interests to pursue a \u201cbalanced foreign policy towards the major powers\u201d. Nguyen Khac Giang, a scholar of Vietnamese politics and visiting fellow at ISEAS, said the US may place more significance on the upgrade in relations with Vietnam, in terms of a counterbalance to China, than Hanoi has in mind. Vietnam sees the agreement as serving a variety of goals, including the rejuvenation of a struggling economy and strengthening public faith in Vietnam\u2019s foreign policy, Giang told Al Jazeera. For Vietnam, the \u201cupgrade carries both symbolic and practical significance, serving a range of interests from geopolitical counterbalancing to initiatives for economic diversification, making it a calculated risk worth taking,\u201d he said. Vietnam has skilfully balanced its relations with larger powers and it is not about to abandon that approach now, said Carl Thayer, emeritus professor at the Australian Defence Force Academy at the University of New South Wales. What has changed, however, is that Vietnam sees the importance of deepening economic ties with the US when China\u2019s economy is \u201cin deep trouble\u201d and the global economy is slowing. not only hurt its own economy but also had a severe impact on Vietnam\u2019s \u2013 as China is Vietnam\u2019s largest trade partner. The elevating of relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership is \u201cmainly about economics and technology\u201d, Thayer said, adding that such a move is not Hanoi being drawn into \u201can anti-China alliance\u201d with the US. \u201cVietnam will not take a step, in my view, with the US that threatens China\u2019s core interest or give the impression that Vietnam is aligning against China,\u201d Thayer told Al Jazeera. Giang, the scholar of Vietnamese politics, also said the upgrade in relations with Washington will not harm Hanoi\u2019s core interests either. \u201cHanoi likely believes it has the tools to ensure the regime\u2019s ideological core remains untouched by potential US influences,\u201d Giang told Al Jazeera. \u201cI don\u2019t foresee this enhanced relationship threatening the one-party state, especially since Washington has signalled its respect for Vietnam\u2019s existing political system.\u201d",

        "content": "The U.S. has reportedly signed an agreement with India, Middle Eastern countries and the European Union to connect them via a network of railways and sea routes, according to Bloomberg . The initiative will establish an energy infrastructure to create and deliver green hydrogen to every collaborating nation. The U.S.-backed plan will connect Middle Eastern nations via rail networks and link India through maritime routes from provincial ports, further stretching toward Eastern Europe. A Push Back Against China's Belt And Road Initiative? The development comes amid China's dominance in the energy-dense region, pitting the U.S.' own initiative against the China's Belt and Road Initiative . Since January, the U.S. has quietly held talks about the project with India, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Israel, according to Bloomberg. In recent times, both the U.S. and EU have been aiming to offset President Xi Jinping 's Belt and Road Initiative, a project that has pumped hundreds of billions into infrastructure development in burgeoning economies. Some U.S. experts believe that Chinese companies and banks working on the Belt and Road projects don't follow global rules and sometimes act dishonestly. Also Read: G20 Summit Turns Attention To Global South Amid Muted Response To Ukraine Conflict Principal Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer told the Wall Street Journal that the transit corridor underpins primary geopolitical goals: to curb Beijing's influence and boost Washington's influence in the Middle East, where its global rivals Russia and China have gained ground in recent years. \"This is a game-changing regional investment,\" President Joe Biden said at an event announcing the plans at the sidelines of the G-20 summit in New Delhi. The Middle East-India Rail & Shipping Corridor In Detail The project's span will cover a total distance of more than 3,000 miles, the Wall Street Journal reported. The corridor will be bypassed across UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Israel, leading to more rapid transit of goods. While Israel isn't anticipated to be a primary contributor in constructing the corridor, its position along the pathway would foster a closer relationship with Saudi Arabia. This reportedly aligns with the White House's efforts to regularize ties between the two nations. U.S. officials didn't specify a completion date, but Biden's senior adviser, Amos Hochstein, mentioned that the nations would convene in 60 days to deliberate on the timeline. The proposed transit route would also enhance ties between Washington and Riyadh, which have faced tensions over matters like human rights. Trans-African Corridor Across Copper Belt The U.S. and the EU will also support a pan-African corridor for transport links between the Democratic Republic of Congo's Katanga zone and Zambia's renowned \"Copper Belt,\" extending to the Lobito port in Angola, according to Bloomberg. The corridor is called the \"Lobito Corridor.\" Read Next: BRICS Alliance Explores Expansion Amid Shifting World Order: Investors Eye These 5 ETFs Photo: Shutterstock",

        "content": "North Korea invited visiting Chinese delegates and Russian artists to a paramilitary parade featuring rocket launchers pulled by trucks and tractors, state media said Saturday, in leader Kim Jong Un \u2019s latest effort to display his ties with Moscow and Beijing in the face of deepening confrontations with Washington. The event in the capital, Pyongyang, which began Friday night to celebrate North Korea\u2019s 75th founding anniversary that fell on Saturday, came amid expectations that Kim will travel to Russia soon for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin that could focus on North Korean arm sales to refill reserves drained by the Kremlin\u2019s war on Ukraine. While China has sent a delegation led by Vice Premier Liu Guozhong to the North Korea\u2019s anniversary celebrations, Russia sent a military song and dance group. South Korean media speculated that the lack of Russian government officials at the festivities in Pyongyang could be related to preparations for a summit between Kim and Putin , which Washington expects within the month. According to some U.S. reports, it could happen as early as next week. Putin is expected to attend an international forum that runs from Sunday to Wednesday in the eastern city of Vladivostok, which was also the site of his first summit with Kim in 2019 and is now seen as a possible venue for their next meeting. South Korea\u2019s spy agency told lawmakers in a closed-door briefing Thursday that North Korea and Russia could also be arranging an unexpected \u201csurprise\u201d route for Kim\u2019s visit to avoid potential venues reported by the media. North Korea has not confirmed any plans for Kim to visit Russia. \u201cWhether or not a Putin-Kim summit soon follows, the United States is attempting to deter serious violations of international law by preemptively releasing intelligence,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. The growing cooperation between China, Russia and North Korea, and Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s decision to skip the Group of 20 Summit in India , give the appearance of a widening fissure in Asia\u2019s geopolitical landscape, he said. Still, a major Russia-North Korea arms deal, which would breach numerous international sanctions, should worry Beijing because \u201cassociation with an emerging pariah state bloc could have negative repercussions for China\u2019s globalized but struggling economy,\u201d Easley said. Korean Central News Agency said Kim received letters from Putin and Xi on the anniversary, where both leaders said that their countries\u2019 strengthening ties with North Korea would contribute to the region\u2019s peace and stability. Saturday\u2019s parade was centered on paramilitary organizations and public security forces protecting Pyongyang, rather than the military units that handle his nuclear-capable weapons systems, which have been the focus of other parades this year. Millions of North Koreans between ages 17 and 60 are listed as Worker-Peasant Red Guards, a national civil defense organization that could be loosely compared to military reserve forces of other countries. Saturday\u2019s marches of the Red Guards included huge columns of motorcycles, anti-tank rockets towed by tractors and civilian-style trucks equipped with multiple rocket launchers, according to Korean Central News Agency\u2019s text reports and photos. Photos showed Kim smiling and talking with his young daughter, believed to be named Ju Ae, as they watched the parade from leather chairs set up at Kim\u2019s balcony in Kim Il Sung Square named after his state-founding grandfather. Since November, Kim Jong Un has been bringing his daughter \u2014 believed to be around 10 years old \u2014 to major public events involving the country\u2019s military. Analysts say Kim\u2019s showcasing of his daughter is meant to send a statement to the world that he has no intention of voluntarily surrendering the nuclear weapons and missiles he sees as the strongest guarantee of his survival and the extension of his family\u2019s dynastic rule . State media did not mention whether Kim made a speech during the parade, indicating that he likely didn\u2019t. Korean Central News Agency said Kim met with Liu and other Chinese delegates ahead of the parade, where they exchanged views on \u201cfurther intensifying the multi-faceted coordination and cooperation\u201d between the countries. Tensions in the Korean peninsula are at their highest point in years, as the pace of both North Korea\u2019s missile tests and the United States\u2019 combined military exercises with South Korea and Japan have intensified in tit-for-tat. To counter the deepening security cooperation between Washington, Seoul and Tokyo, Kim has been trying to boost the visibility of his partnerships with Moscow and Beijing as he seeks to break out of diplomatic isolation and have North Korea be a part of a united front against the United States. In July, Kim invited delegations led by Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chinese Communist Party Politburo member Li Hongzhong to a huge military parade in Pyongyang , where he rolled out his most powerful weapons, including intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to target the U.S. mainland. A day before the parade, Kim took Shoigu on a tour of a domestic arms exhibition, which demonstrated North Korea\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and added to suspicions the North was willing to supply arms to Russia. In exchange for providing Russia with artillery shells and other ammunition, North Korea could seek badly needed energy and food aid and advanced weapons technologies, analysts say. There are concerns that potential Russian technology transfers would increase the threat posed by Kim\u2019s growing arsenal of nuclear weapons and missiles that are designed to target the United States and its Asian allies.",

[+] photograph of a man, with facial features identified and facial bounding boxes present, San Ramon, California, November 22, 2019. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Getty Images I spent the start of the week at the imposing Stormont building in Belfast. It has been the centre of power in Northern Ireland for nearly one hundred years, and hosts Northern Ireland\u2019s Assembly, which notoriously now has not sat for over a year, something the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland would like to see rectified Notwithstanding this the local economy is strong (unemployment is 2.7%) and this weekend there will be a US led investment conference in the city, which amongst many other things, demonstrates the economic dividend of falling geopolitical risk. Unfortunately, Northern Ireland is very much the outlier here, as geopolitical risk is on the rise across the international spectrum. One of the sharpest reminders that we are in a \u2018war by other means\u2019 environment is the ongoing \u2018Chip Wars\u2019, the latest salvo of which involved the Chinese government banning the use of iPhones by government employees (presumably as a form of leverage over the USA at the same time as Huawei is launching a new flagship phone). EU AI Act Despite this I have found the lack of interest by European firms (large and medium sized) in geopolitics to be striking. In markets, geopolitical risk has rarely been a major factor over the past forty years, owing to the tailwind of globalisation (no wars amongst democracies and emerging markets have been on a path to growth). The events that signalled the cracks in globalisation \u2013 Brexit and the Trump trade war \u2013 were risks that investors needed to measure. In addition, as inflation has risen, the absence of quantitative easing has made markets more sensitive to geopolitical risk.

New Pixel 8 Pro Leaks Reveal Google s Smart Decision In today\u2019s multipolar world where strategic competition is increasingly the norm, geopolitical risks loom large\u2013 from the risk that Donald Trump comes close to re-election, to the drive of Chinese technology into Europe (BYD cars have arrived) to the re-alignment of the European defense, aerospace and greentech industries owing to the war in Ukraine. Many of these risks are events that require a response and readjustment, others are more existential. One important source of risk is the way governments react to landmark technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI). The ways in which the use (and abuse of these technologies) is framed and watched over can determine the shape of the industries of the future. As an early mover on regulation, Europe\u2019s response to AI is the EU AI Act, whose main contribution is to divide the application of AI into four pillars from harmless to very harmful (akin to China\u2019s use of AI for social credit scoring). The fact that Europe has moved first sets the bar for other regulatory initiatives on AI, notably that being pursued by Chuck Schumer in the US and Japan\u2019s G7 level \u2018Hiroshima\u2019 paper on AI. Confusion One area of vibrant debate, and some confusion, that has opened up is that way in which companies \u2013 software, media, data firms \u2013 who do not necessarily \u2018generate\u2019 AI content formally but are at the centre of many of its processes, are treated. The extent to which they will be policed by the AI Act is not clear and we have not yet had detail forthcoming from the EU. Indeed, it may well be up to individual companies to try to take the lead within their own industries for setting out the ways in which they will treat and use AI (telecoms, retailers with large datasets for example). An additional source of confusion lies in the use of AI by start-up firms, especially out of France (ironically), which is striving to become an AI innovation centre (it has a rich labour market here and the backing of key entrepreneurs). Their argument is that the Act might constrain innovation by new firms. One response to this may well be a \u2018sandbox\u2019 system where young companies are allowed to innovate in a regulatory sandbox, to a certain level of commercialisation. A related issue that is bubbling up is access to models (and data) for researchers, and whether we might begin to see more EU coordination on this. We also need more detail on governance. It may well be that there is a top-level AI Office at the EU level, with then individual state AI Offices, or to make matters more complicated some countries may argue to have an AI office for sub-sectors (AI in telecoms, AI in banking for instance). This is not yet resolved. A sure sign that AI is becoming the terrain of competition between the large nations is that the UK is trying to become the \u2018locus\u2019 of AI regulation, in the sense that it is signalling that it wants to be the coordinator of international regulatory activity, and in the same way as Geneva hosts the WHO, WTO, it wants to be the locus of AI standards. The AI Summit at Bletchley (Nov. 1 st and 2nd) will be an important milestone here. If the UK was to physically host an international regulatory body, why not have it in Northern Ireland?

Korea Anniversary Parade By Cat Barton and Kang Jin-kyu 09/09/23 AT 12:06 AM EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Flipboard Kim Jong Un at Friday's parade with his daughter AFP North Korea marked its founding anniversary with a parade attended by leader Kim Jong Un as well as Russian diplomats and a high-ranking Chinese delegation, state media said Saturday, as Pyongyang deepens ties with Moscow and Beijing. The Friday event featured Pyongyang's \"paramilitary forces\", state media said, rather than soldiers in the regular army, and it did not appear to showcase the country's banned weaponry including intercontinental ballistic missiles. Images in state media showed uniformed paramilitary brigades, including some riding tractors or in large red trucks, as Kim, flanked by his young daughter, looked on smiling and clapping. Kim Il Sung Square \"was full of excitement and joy of the spectators significantly celebrating the birthday of their great powerful country\", the official Korean Central News Agency reported. \"All the participants paid the highest glory and warmest thanks to Kim Jong Un, peerless patriot and ever-victorious iron-willed commander.\" Kim met with the visiting Chinese delegation led by Liu Guozhong, vice-premier of the State Council, the second such visit by top officials from Beijing in six weeks, as Pyongyang shows signs of easing its strict Covid-era border controls. The two sides announced their aims of \"further intensifying the multi-faceted coordination and cooperation\" between the two countries, according to a separate KCNA report. Russian diplomats also attended the event, as well as a Russian military song-and-dance ensemble which had arrived in Pyongyang to mark the occasion, KCNA reported. Moscow expanded its official presence in North Korea shortly before the parade, with its Pyongyang embassy saying this week that it had been allowed to bring in 20 diplomatic and technical staff -- the first such rotation of personnel since 2019. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent Kim a message marking the anniversary, KCNA said Saturday, in which he called for the two countries to \"expand the bilateral ties in all respects\". And according to Chinese state media, President Xi Jinping \"extended congratulations in a call to Kim Jong Un\" on the anniversary. Friday's event was the nuclear-armed state's third parade this year. The last one -- a military parade featuring the country's most advanced weaponry -- took place in late July to commemorate the signing of an armistice that ended hostilities in the 1950-53 Korean War. The Chinese and Russian visits come as speculation mounts that Kim -- who rarely leaves his country and has not travelled since the coronavirus pandemic started -- will meet Putin to discuss arms deals. US and other officials told The New York Times that Kim is likely to head by armoured train later this month to Vladivostok, on Russia's Pacific coast not far from North Korea, to meet Putin. \"Whether or not a Putin-Kim summit soon follows, the United States is attempting to deter serious violations of international law by preemptively releasing intelligence,\" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. Growing cooperation between China, Russia and North Korea, coupled with Xi skipping the G20 Summit in India, \"give the appearance of a widening fissure in Asia's geopolitical landscape\", he said. \"Most stakeholders in the region want to avoid a new Cold War, but this looks increasingly difficult as Beijing and Moscow prop up Pyongyang and North Korea aligns itself with China and Russia's challenges to the international order.\" Though, he added: \"A major Russia-North Korea arms deal, in breach of numerous international sanctions, should worry Beijing.\" The parade came two days after Pyongyang unveiled its first \"tactical nuclear attack submarine\", with Kim declaring it part of a \"push forward with the nuclear weaponisation of the Navy\", although the South Korean military said the vessel might not be operational. North Korea has conducted a record number of weapons tests this year, and last month failed in its second attempt to put a spy satellite into orbit. South Korea and the United States have ramped up security cooperation in response.

What can be done now?",
        "content": "The European Commission has opened a call for evidence to gather evidence and assess the functioning of the Governance Regulation. The governance rules and frameworks established with the Regulation guarantee that the climate and energy legislation is planned, implemented, monitored and reviewed in a coordinated and consistent manner with the EU\u2019s energy and climate target, including the climate neutrality goal, across all member states. Without such a governance infrastructure, the mere adoption of environmental and climate legislation, sectoral and economy-wide, is not a sufficient guarantee of success in achieving the sustainable transformation needed. T&E welcomes the opportunity to respond to the call of evidence and with this document aims at addressing some areas of improvement of EU energy and climate governance. The governance framework and rules adopted in 2018 have become outdated as since then the EU has collectively committed to achieve climate neutrality by mid-century, which required to revise upward the 2030 target and significantly accelerate decarbonisation via the Fit for 55 policy package. Moreover, geopolitical events, such as the war in Ukraine , have exacerbated security of energy supply issues and worsened the economic distress started with the pandemic in 2020, pointing more than ever to the necessity to switch to a fossil fuel free economy and to keep together energy security, climate mitigation, industrial strategy and social policies. However, in the meantime, some of the governance instruments made available by the Governance Regulation to govern the EU\u2019s and its member states\u2019 transition to the long term goal of emission-free economy, namely the National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) and the Long Term Strategies (LTSs), have proved to be flawed.

        "content": "North Korea invited visiting Chinese delegates and Russian artists to a paramilitary parade featuring rocket launchers pulled by trucks and tractors, state media said Saturday, in leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s latest effort to display his ties with Moscow and Beijing in the face of deepening confrontations with Washington. The event in the capital, Pyongyang, which began Friday night to celebrate North Korea\u2019s 75th founding anniversary that fell on Saturday, came amid expectations that Kim will travel to Russia soon for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin that could focus on North Korean arm sales to refill reserves drained by the Kremlin\u2019s war on Ukraine. While has sent a delegation led by Vice Premier Liu Guozhong to the North Korea\u2019s anniversary celebrations, Russia sent a military song-and-dance group. South Korean media speculated that the lack of Russian government officials at the festivities in Pyongyang could be related to preparations for a summit between Kim and Putin, which Washington expects within the month. According to some U.S. reports, a summit could happen as early as next week. is expected to attend an international forum that runs from Sunday to Wednesday in the eastern Russian city of Vladivostok, which also was the site of his first summit with Kim in 2019 and now is seen as a possible venue for their next meeting. South Korea\u2019s spy agency told lawmakers in a closed-door briefing Thursday that North Korea and Russia also could be arranging an unexpected \u201csurprise\u201d route for Kim\u2019s visit to avoid potential venues reported by the media. North Korea has not confirmed any plans for Kim to visit Russia. \u201cWhether or not a Putin/Kim summit soon follows, the United States is attempting to deter serious violations of international law by preemptively releasing intelligence,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. The growing cooperation between China, Russia and \u2014 plus Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s decision to skip the Group of 20 Summit in India \u2014 give the appearance of a widening fissure in Asia\u2019s geopolitical landscape, he said. Still, a major Russia-North Korea arms deal, which would breach numerous international sanctions, should worry Beijing because \u201cassociation with an emerging pariah state bloc could have negative repercussions for China\u2019s globalized but struggling economy,\u201d Easley said. The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Kim received letters from Putin and Xi on the anniversary, in which both leaders said their countries\u2019 strengthening ties with North Korea would contribute to the region\u2019s peace and stability. Saturday\u2019s parade was centered on paramilitary organizations and public security forces protecting Pyongyang, rather than the military units that handle his weapons systems, which have been the focus of other parades this year. State media did not mention whether Kim made a speech during the parade, indicating that he likely didn\u2019t. KCNA said Kim met with Liu and other Chinese delegates ahead of the parade, where they exchanged views on \u201cfurther intensifying the multi-faceted coordination and cooperation\u201d between the countries. Tensions in the Korean Peninsula are at their highest point in years, as the pace of both North Korea\u2019s missile tests and the United States\u2019 combined military exercises with South Korea and Japan have intensified in tit-for-tat. To counter the deepening security cooperation between Washington, Seoul and Tokyo, Kim has been trying to boost the visibility of his partnerships with Moscow and Beijing as he seeks to break out of diplomatic isolation and have North Korea be a part of a united front against the United States.

        "description": "Israel and the Saudi kingdom do not have an all-or-nothing approach.",
        "content": "On the surface, it appears inconceivable that a hardline Israeli government could expand the Abraham Accords and forge meaningful ties with the Saudi Kingdom. Israel\u2019s hardline coalition seems unlikely to accede to Riyadh\u2019s requirements that it never annex the West Bank or establish new settlements, in line with the Biden Administration\u2019s efforts to foster such a peace agreement. Meanwhile, Riyadh has undertaken something of . A peace agreement that would complicate Saudi Arabia\u2019s d\u00e9tente with Iran hardly appears to be in the offing. Yet Israel and the Saudi kingdom do not have an all-or-nothing approach. Media of security cooperation between the two countries has become routine. The signs of eventual normalized relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia are already visible. While Iran has punished its athletes for simply associating with Israelis, the Saudis have allowed Israeli and to compete in the kingdom. Furthermore, both Israel and Saudi Arabia back interim steps that can lead to full normalization. These include, for example, the prospect of Israel developing an . This could position Israel and Saudi Arabia at the center of valuable trade route that would link Europe to the Gulf, and via Saudi ports create a link to India and Asia. The Biden administration likely had this in mind during U.S. National Security advisor Jake Sullivan\u2019s in Riyadh with his Saudi, Emirati, and Indian counterparts. A regional economic and trade bloc would extend to the sphere of defense and security as well. In February 2023, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced it was setting up a network of information sharing and cyber security resilience to promote cybersecurity for Israel and Sunni Gulf States. This is just the start. Saudi Arabia is seeking to forge a NATO-style security treaty in which the U.S. would be obligated to come to its defense in the event of an Iranian attack. As part of this treaty, Saudi Arabia would purchase the American Terminal High Altitude Area Defense antiballistic missile defense system, which could be used to shore up its defenses against Iran\u2019s growing missile arsenal. Although Saudi recognition of Israel would complicate Riyadh\u2019s\u2019 efforts to establish d\u00e9tente with Tehran, a security treaty styled after NATO could in the future bring together the U.S., Israel, and Sunni States and deter Iranian aggression. Israel hopes that a U.S. security guarantee to Riyadh could obviate its ambition for a civilian nuclear program monitored and backed by the U.S. This is due to Israel\u2019s concern of the prospect of a civilian nuclear reactor being converted for military applications. To this end, Israel\u2019s Foreign Minister Eli Cohen reportedly that, \u201c[A] defense pledge could reassure Middle Eastern nations, primarily Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states.\u201d Moreover, he continued, \u201cthis approach would make individual nuclear ambitions unnecessary, bolster regional stability, and promote the peace and normalization agenda.\u201d Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer went even further declaring Israel\u2019s willingness to drop objections to a Saudi civilian nuclear program as part of a peace agreement with Riyadh. Israel is well aware that Saudi Arabia can turn to China to develop a nuclear program and would rather it be developed by the U.S. on its own terms. In 2020, China was advancing its and the . China has its building of a in Abu Dhabi as part of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberal Army plans to build a global military network. Beijing also assisted Riyadh\u2019s development of its and manufacturing its own . China is also Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest trading partner, and China\u2019s Belt Road Initiative is contributing to the Gulf\u2019s digital transformation. China aims to embed itself in the region\u2019s infrastructure by investing in advanced technologies such as clean energy, which could be incorporated into Gulf economic diversification efforts. In testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, commander of U.S. Central Command, asserted in March 2023 that the U.S. was \u201c .\u201d Kurilla , \u201cThe People\u2019s Republic of China has chosen to compete in the region. The PRC is aggressively expanding its diplomatic, informational, military and economic outreach across the region.\u201d A peace agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel would contribute to broader U.S. geopolitical ambitions of keeping China (and state-connected Chinese firms such as Huawei) out of the Middle East, making Saudi Arabia more reliant on U.S. weapons, and preventing Beijing from establishing a military base on Saudi soil. This will require a coordinated U.S. government strategy approach towards the Middle East. BIden\u2019s appointment of a Special Envoy for the Abraham Accords is a step in the right direction. As opposed to China\u2019s approach of offering infrastructure development via its BRI and debt trap diplomacy in the Middle East, the Biden Administration seeks to advance the sustainable development of infrastructure in a transparent manner. The U.S. aims to achieve this by fostering healthy interdependency between states via free trade agreements. The Biden administration\u2019s approach of vertical expansion is to deepen economic benefits to citizens of partnering countries. The U.S. Development Finance Corporation is also offering loan guarantees to incentivize U.S. companies to invest in developing markets. This approach is far more transparent than China\u2019s. Development Finance Corporation projects in Asia and Latin America could be replicated in the Middle East for lower-income countries. This would lead the U.S. to work with partners across the Middle East on projects that can create prosperity in poorer countries such as Jordan. In the long run, a common market in the Gulf, coupled with increased security, defense and intelligence ties across the region could offset Iranian influence. The momentum toward normalization and ultimately a peace agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia is not going to be determined by their respective domestic policies or local concerns. Rather, a peace agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia will emerge from their continued incremental progress toward normalization to create markets and security frameworks. This may come together within broader geopolitical concerns, such as U.S.-China competition to extend influence in the Gulf and across the Middle East.",

Roy, 61, is a vocal critic of the Indian government\u2019s treatment of minorities \u2013 mainly its 200 million Muslims \u2013 and other rights violations since Modi came to power in 2014. From her home in New Delhi, she spoke to Al Jazeera about the G20 event and the state of India\u2019s minorities. Look, I don\u2019t think anybody really cares about that because\u2026 the G20 is here, everybody is looking for an opportunity, a trade deal or a military equipment deal or a geopolitical strategic understanding. So it\u2019s not as if any single one of the people who are coming here, the heads of state or anyone else doesn\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going on in India. In countries like the US and the UK and France, the mainstream media has been so critical of what\u2019s happening in India, but the governments have a different agenda altogether. So I don\u2019t think one needs to be naive enough to believe that that is an issue at all for the people coming here. It won\u2019t. None of them will. I have no such expectation. But I think what\u2019s interesting is that if you were in Delhi, as I am now, if you look at the publicity, if you look at the banners, if you look at all the preparations that are being made for the G20, you would be forgiven for imagining that it wasn\u2019t the government of India that is hosting the G20, but the BJP. Every single banner has a huge lotus on it, which is the symbol of a political party. Modi\u2019s BJP. What has happened in India and it\u2019s so dangerous, so blatant, is that the country, the nation, the government and its institutions have all been conflated with the ruling party \u2013 a political party. And that ruling party has been conflated with Modi, the individual. In fact, there is hardly any ruling party now, there\u2019s just a ruler. So it\u2019s as if Modi is hosting the G20. All of us are locked in. We can\u2019t go out. The poor have been purged from the city. The slums have been screened off. The roads are barricaded, the traffic is shut down. It\u2019s as quiet as death. It is as if he\u2019s so ashamed of all of us, of what the city is really like. It\u2019s been purged and locked down for this event. Of course it\u2019s a vanity event. He\u2019ll pirouette and it\u2019s just before the elections. So it will feed into his campaign. All these Western leaders who speak about democracy \u2013 I mean, you can forgive someone like Trump because he doesn\u2019t believe in democracy \u2013 but Biden, Macron, all these people who talk about democracy, they know exactly what\u2019s going on here. They know that Muslims have been massacred, that Muslims who protest have their homes bulldozed, which means all the public institutions \u2013 courts, magistrates, the press \u2013 collude in that. They know that Muslims in certain towns have X marks on their doors and are being asked to leave. They know that Muslims have been ghettoised. And that now people who are accused of actually lynching, murdering Muslims are leading so-called religious processions through these ghettos. They know that vigilantes are out there with swords, calling for annihilation, calling for the mass rape of Muslim women. They know all this, but that doesn\u2019t matter because as always with certain Western countries, it\u2019s like \u201cdemocracy for us\u201d and, you know, \u201cdictatorship or whatever else it is for our non-white friends\u201d. It doesn\u2019t matter. I would say that it would be foolhardy for you to think that a process in which a country of 1.4 billion people that used to be a flawed democracy \u2013 and is now falling into a kind of, well, I can only use the word fascism \u2013 is not going to affect the rest of the world, you\u2019re extremely wrong. What I say wouldn\u2019t be a cry for help. It would be to say, \u201cLook around at what you are, what you are actually helping to create.\u201d There was a moment in time in 2002 after the anti-Muslim Gujarat massacre \u2013 in which intelligence reports by countries like the UK actually held Modi responsible for what they called ethnic cleansing. Modi was banned from travelling to the US, but all of that is forgotten now. But he\u2019s the same man. And every time somebody allows him this kind of oxygen and this kind of space to pirouette and claim that only he could have brought these powerful people to India, that message magnified a thousand-fold by our servile new channels, it feeds into a kind of collective national insecurity, sense of inferiority and false vanity. It\u2019s blown up into something else that\u2019s extremely dangerous and that people should understand is not going to just be a problem for India. We have a situation where we are talking about one nation, one language, one election. But actually we are in a situation where you have one dictator, one corporation. Arundhati Roy What I meant was that, you know, in the last few years, we have actually spoken about the rise of the BJP, of Modi, of the RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the BJP\u2019s ideological mentor] \u2013 the mothership of the cult of Hindu Supremacy \u2013 of which Modi has been a lifetime member. We have, some of us, critiqued it politically, structurally. But now we are in a different situation altogether. Although we do have elections, I wouldn\u2019t call us a democracy anymore. But because we have elections, this message of Hindu supremacy has to be beamed out to 1.4 billion people in order to create a reliable constituency. So election season becomes extremely dangerous for minorities. What I meant by \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a different phase now\u201d is that it\u2019s no longer just the leadership that we must fear, but a section of this indoctrinated population that has made the streets dangerous for minorities. The violence is no longer limited to government-orchestrated pogroms. We are witnessing incident after incident of banal evil, as Hannah Arendt might have put it. The world saw the video of an ordinary little classroom in north India where the teacher, the principal of the school, gets a seven-year-old Muslim boy to stand up and has all the other Hindu children come up and slap him. We have a civil war unfolding in Manipur where the state government is partisan, the centre is complicit, the security forces do not have a chain of command. It\u2019s beginning to resemble what happened in the Balkans. We saw the horrifying sight of women being paraded naked and gang-raped. We learned that it was the Manipur police who handed the women over to the mob. We have, as I said before, people accused of murder, of lynching, of burning alive young Muslim men, now leading religious processions. We have a situation where the prime minister speaks on Independence Day about women\u2019s rights, but at that very moment, his government signs a pardon for the 14 men who gang-raped Bilkis Bano and killed 14 members of a family. And they are now respected members of society. These are men who had been convicted to life imprisonment by the highest court in the land. So we have a situation now where the constitution has been more or less set aside. If they win the election next year, in 2026, there\u2019s going to be what we call \u201cdelimitation\u201d, which is a kind of gerrymandering where the number of seats and geography of constituencies will be changed and the Hindi speaking belt where the BJP is the strongest, will get more seats, which will basically change the balance of power. The south will definitely be very, very uneasy with this and that too has the power of or the potential of Balkanisation. We have a situation where, you know, we are talking about one nation, one language, one election. But actually, we are in a situation where you have one dictator, one corporation. We have a corporate head who has been an old friend of Modi\u2019s from the time of the Gujarat pogrom, who now is accused by not just not just a short selling company called the Hindenburg Research, but now by a whole coalition of journalists who report organised crime, talking about him pulling off the biggest corporate sort of scandal in history. But nothing will be done. So we\u2019re in a situation where the world also has to assess what happens when the rules don\u2019t apply to some people and apply differently to other people. All the rules. You know, we have a rule of law. We have a very sophisticated jurisprudence. But how it\u2019s applied depends on what your religion is, what your caste is, what your gender is, what your class is. We are in a very, very dangerous place. I don't think anybody expects anybody outside of India to stand up and take notice because all their eyes have dollar signs in them, and they are looking at this huge market of a billion people. But, you know, there won't be a market when this country slides into chaos and war. Arundhati Roy The state of India is very precarious, very contested. We have a situation in which the constitution has been effectively set aside. We have a situation in which the BJP is now one of the richest political parties in the world. And all the election machinery is more or less compromised. And yet \u2013 not just because of the violence against minorities, which of course causes a kind of majoritarianism and may not cause them to lose elections \u2013 but because of unemployment and because we live in one of the most unequal societies in the world, we have an opposition that is building up. This government is seeking to crush it because it does not believe that there should be an opposition. We are in a situation of great flux and we don\u2019t expect, I don\u2019t think anybody expects, anybody outside of India to stand up and take notice because all their eyes have dollar signs in them, and they are looking at this huge market of a billion people. But, you know, there won\u2019t be a market when this country slides into chaos and war, as it already has in places like Manipur. What they don\u2019t realise is that this market won\u2019t exist when this grand country falls into chaos as it is. The beauty and the grandeur of India are being reduced to something small and snarling and petty and violent. And when that explodes, I think there\u2019ll be nothing like it.",

Sex worker Rahab helped hide spies in her house. Lebrecht/Getty While some Christians might protest that Rahab\u2019s profession is incidental to the story, there\u2019s some academic debate about this. In one recent article Dr. Alexiana Fry asks \u201cDid the spies encounter Rahab because they were seeking sex?\u201d If James Bond has taught us anything, it\u2019s that spies have voracious sexual appetites. If that\u2019s the case then Rahab\u2019s profession is critically important. Then there\u2019s the messier and lesser-known story of Tamar in the book of Genesis. Tamar married Er, the son of Judah (the eponymous founder of the tribe of Judah) but Er died before they had any children. Judah commanded that Tamar marry Er\u2019s brother Onan in what is known as a levirate union. In this arrangement, when a man died without children, his brother would procreate with his widow and the resulting male offspring would become the deceased\u2019s legal heirs. (Yes, you did read that correctly. There\u2019s even a story in the New Testament in which Jesus is quizzed about a hypothetical situation in which a woman married seven brothers in succession). Onan, Er\u2019s younger brother, was perfectly happy to have sex with Tamar, but he didn\u2019t want to lose his additional share of Er\u2019s inheritance to a new baby. So, in the Bible\u2019s first instance of contraception, he withdrew and \u201cspilled his seed on the ground.\u201d God is unimpressed and kills Er, leaving Tamar widowed again. There is a third brother, Shelah, but he is too young to marry and so Tamar waits in her father-in-law\u2019s house for the boy to reach manhood. When he does, Judah reneges on his promise. Alone, used, and deceived, Tamar takes things into her own hands. Judah himself recently became a widower and when Tamar learned he was taking a trip she dressed herself up as a sex worker, veiled her face, and placed herself in his path. Judah did not recognize his daughter-in-law on the roadside and propositioned her. In their negotiations over the price of sex Tamar accepted the offer of a young goat but asked for Judah\u2019s seal, cord, and staff (the equivalent of his driver\u2019s license) as collateral until the goat arrived. Judah agreed and they exchanged goods. When Judah returns to swap out the goat for his personal effects the \u201cshrine prostitute\u201d had vanished. The embarrassed Judah decides to keep quiet about the whole thing. Judah and his daughter-in-law Tamar. Sepia Times/Getty Predictably, however, Tamar becomes pregnant, and her male relatives are on the cusp of burning her to death when she produces the seal, staff, and cord. Judah recognizes his property and concludes that her act of deception and prostitution was fair play: \u201cShe is more righteous than I,\u201d he says, \u201csince I wouldn\u2019t give her to my son Shelah.\u201d Tamar didn\u2019t have to sleep with her in-laws anymore and her twin sons became the heirs to Judah. In the New Testament, as is relatively well-known, Jesus regularly fraternizes with sex workers (not like that, though). In one story, that appears in various versions in the Gospels, a woman bursts into the home of Simon the leper in Bethany and anoints Jesus with a costly jar of perfumed ointment. (In 591 CE Pope Gregory the Great mistakenly identified this woman as Mary Magdalene, sparking two millennia of confusion about Mary M\u2019s profession.) The sulky disciples are quite sniffy about the whole thing and declare it a waste of money, but Jesus shuts that down. He responds that she has anointed him for burial, \u201cTruly I tell you, wherever the good news is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in remembrance of her.\u201d As Sarah Levin-Richardson has written in her book on The Brothel of Pompeii , sex workers were often gifted perfume by clients. The fact that this woman is moving around unaccompanied at night and has access to perfumed oil, thus, suggests that she was part of the world\u2019s oldest profession. A woman, who Pope Gregory the Great, mistakenly identified as Mary Magdalene anoints the feet of Jesus. Hulton Archive/Getty In Luke\u2019s version of the story, the woman\u2019s occupation is quite explicit, she is described as a \u201csinful woman.\u201d In this version, she washes his feet with her tears and dries them with her hair. Once again, Jesus rebukes her critics\u2014in this instance, a Pharisee. Though in this version Jesus does refer to the woman\u2019s many sins and forgives them, he does not ask her to change her profession or explicitly refer to sexual misconduct as being among her sins. This is in distinction to a story in the Gospel of John in which he directly tells a man he had just healed to \u201csin no more.\u201d At a minimum, Jesus isn\u2019t that hung up on her trade and was happy for her to use the fruits of her work to anoint him. Though some readers might think that these stories are outliers in a compendium of old-fashioned patriarchal morality, the women are not. Jesus\u2019s words about the woman who anoints him form one of his most secure prophecies: we are, in fact, still talking about her. As for Tamar and Rahab, in Christian tradition they are remembered as instrumental in the history of Israel and genealogy of Jesus himself. The Gospel of Matthew begins with a long list of ancestors that ties Jesus, through Joseph, to David and Abraham. It is, as you would expect, a long list of men begetting one another. But explicitly named in this catalog of men are five women: Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, the wife of Uriah (i.e. Bathsheba), and Mary, the mother of Jesus. What ties these women together? Well, while someone might argue that the four women who preceded Mary are outsiders and their inclusion signals that Jesus\u2019 message would be delivered to gentiles as well as Jews this argument doesn\u2019t quite work. How would these women be connected to Mary, a Jew? The other explanation is that all five women were involved in sexual scandals. Tamar and Rahab had practiced sex work; Ruth seduced and later married her kinsman Boaz; and, in the view of ancient readers, Bathsheba was an adulteress. What links them to Mary is the veil of suspicion that surrounded the conception of Jesus. In the Gospels she is explicitly identified as a virgin who had not had sex with anyone, but plenty of non-Christians found the tale a bit hard to believe if not outright laughable. The North African Christian writer Tertullian tells us that people accused Jesus of being the \u201cson of a carpenter or a whore.\u201d The pagan critic Celsus says that she was seeing a Roman soldier on the side. Mary might have been a virgin, but she had a bad reputation and was regularly slut shamed by Christianity\u2019s critics. Leaving Mary aside, the fact remains that for early Christians the women who broke the sexual rules were instrumental in the history of Israel and the generation of Jesus. Assertive women who used the resources they had to better their circumstances and those of their family members are implicitly valued and respected. More importantly they play a critical role in securing the success and survival of God\u2019s chosen people. The genealogy of Jesus\u00ad\u2014which omits the docile wives and virtuous homemakers in Israel\u2019s history\u2014is a tacit indictment of slut shaming writ large. As it turns out, well-behaved women rarely rate a mention in the history of Jesus. Candida Moss @candidamoss candidarmoss@gmail.com Got a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .",

        "description": "President Biden and his allies have outlined plans to create a rail and shipping corridor linking India with the Middle East and ultimately Europe.",
        "content": "President Biden and his allies on Saturday announced plans to build a rail and shipping corridor linking India with the Middle East and Europe, an ambitious project aimed at fostering economic growth and political cooperation . \u201cThis is a big deal,\u201d said Biden. \u201cThis is a really big deal.\u201d The corridor , outlined at the annual Group of 20 summit of the world\u2019s top economies, would help boost trade, deliver energy resources and improve digital connectivity. It would include India, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Israel and the European Union, said Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s national security advisor. Sullivan said the network reflected Biden\u2019s vision for \u201cfar-reaching investments\u201d that come from \u201ceffective American leadership\u201d and a willingness to embrace other nations as partners. He said the enhanced infrastructure would boost economic growth, help bring countries in the Middle East together and establish that region as a hub for economic activity instead of as a \u201csource of challenge, conflict or crisis\u201d as it has been in recent history. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi , European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other leaders from around the world participated in the announcement. \u201cEnhancing connectivity with all regions has been a key priority for India,\u201d said Modi, speaking through an interpreter. \u201cWe believe that connectivity is a means to not only increase mutual trade between different countries but also increase mutual trust.\u201d The rail and shipping corridor would help physically tie together a vast stretch of the globe, improving digital connectivity and enabling more trade among countries, including with energy products such as hydrogen. Although White House officials did not set a timeline for its completion, the corridor would provide a physical and ideological alternative to China\u2019s own nation-spanning infrastructure program. The White House gave no details on the project\u2019s cost or financing, though Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman mentioned a figure of $20 billion during the announcement. It was unclear whether that sum applied solely to the Saudi commitment. After the announcement, Biden greeted the crown prince with a hearty handshake , a friendlier exchange than when they last met, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, just over a year ago. At that time, Biden, who had harshly criticized Prince Mohammed over the kingdom\u2019s human rights record, awkwardly greeted him with a fist bump, a moment roundly criticized by rights activists. Von der Leyen described the project as a \u201cgreen and digital bridge across continents and civilizations.\u201d She added that it includes cables to transmit electricity and data. She also announced a \u201cTrans-African Corridor\u201d connecting the Angolan port of Lobito with landlocked areas of the continent: the Kananga province in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the copper-mining regions of Zambia. Speaking of the African project, Biden called it a \u201cgame-changing regional investment\u201d and said \u201cboth of these are huge, huge steps forward.\u201d Amos Hochstein, Biden\u2019s coordinator for global infrastructure and energy security, laid out a rough timeline for the project over the next year. In the next 60 days, working groups will put together a fuller plan and set timelines. The first phase will involve identifying the areas that need investment and where physical infrastructure can be connected between countries. Hochstein said the plans can be put into place over the next year so that the project can move onto setting up finances and construction. Sullivan said the project started coming together after Biden visited Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in July 2022, where he emphasized a need for greater regional economic integration. In January, the White House started having conversations with regional partners about the concept. By spring, maps and written assessments of existing rail infrastructure in the Middle East were being drafted. Sullivan, and senior White House aides Hochstein and Brett McGurk, traveled to Saudi Arabia in May to meet with their Indian, Saudi and UAE counterparts. All sides have worked since then to finalize details of the agreement announced Saturday. The parties also brought Israel and Jordan into the project. Saudi Arabia and Israel do not have diplomatic relations, though the White House has been pushing them toward normalizing relations. Sullivan said the transportation project is not seen as a \u201cprecursor\u201d to a potential normalization deal but he characterized Israel\u2019s inclusion as \u201csignificant.\u201d \u201cThe participants in this effort are focused on practical outcomes that deliver for their people,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cAnd a corridor of this kind by dint of geography works best having Israel in as opposed to out and the countries participating prioritized that.\u201d Biden participated in both G20 sessions on Saturday. He highlighted plans to push for more investments to address climate change, such as his own domestic incentives to encourage the use of renewable energy. He also argued that Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is hurting many other nations, which have had to cope with greater food and energy costs as well as higher interest rate costs on their debt. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been a regular presence at international summits, including last year\u2019s G20 in Indonesia, since Russia invaded his country more than 18 months ago, was not invited by Modi\u2019s government to this year\u2019s gathering. Zelensky has used the high-profile gatherings to argue for continued economic and military support for his country. India is one of the most prominent U.S. allies that has largely stayed on the sidelines of the war, and has even dramatically increased its purchases of Russian oil. Jon Finer, the White House principal deputy national security advisor, said the administration pushed for Zelensky\u2019s inclusion at the summit. \u201cUltimately, it is not our decision,\u201d Finer said. \u201cBut you can expect that the United States and our other partners who are working with Ukraine so closely ... We\u2019ll make that case quite forcefully in the context of these conversations.\u201d The summit communique, a joint statement agreed to by all participants, addressed the war, among other issues. It included language underlining the principle that states cannot use force to change borders, disavowed the use of nuclear weapons and called for a just peace based on the principles of the U.N. Charter. The communique also underscored that attacks on civilian infrastructure must end. During the summit, Biden also discussed his request to Congress for additional funding for the World Bank that could generate more than $25 billion in new lending for economic development. The White House more broadly is trying to strengthen the G20 as an international forum, while Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin decided not to attend. Biden has said he was disappointed by Xi\u2019s decision. Asked again about the Chinese leader\u2019s absence, Biden said Saturday that the summit \u201cis going well\u201d though \u201cit would be nice to have him here.\u201d",

About High-Yield Accounts High-yield savings accounts aren't the only accounts paying favorable rates right now. You'll typically see the highest rates at online or lower-profile institutions rather than national brands with a significant brick and mortar presence. This is normal; online banks have lower overhead cost and are willing to pay high rates to attract new customers. High-Yield Savings Accounts The best high-yield savings accounts provide the security of a savings account with the added bonus of a high APY. Savings accounts are held at a bank or credit union \u2014 not invested through a brokerage account \u2014 and are best for saving cash in pursuit of shorter-term goals, like a vacation or big purchase. High-Yield Checking Accounts The best high-yield checking accounts tend to pay slightly lower rates than high-yield savings, but even they are strong in today's rate environment. A checking account is like a hub for your money: If your paycheck is direct deposited, it's typically to a checking account. If you transfer money to pay a bill, you typically do it from a checking account. Checking accounts are used for everyday spending and usually come with checks and/or debit cards to make that easy. Money Market Accounts The best money market accounts could be considered a middle ground between checking and savings: They are used for saving money but typically provide easy access to your account through checks or a debit card. They usually offer a tiered interest rate depending on your balance. Cash Management Accounts A cash management account is also like a savings/checking hybrid. You'll generally see them offered by online banks, and, unlike a checking account, they usually offer unlimited transfers. A savings account often limits the number of monthly transfers, while a checking account doesn't. Cash management accounts typically come with a debit card for easy access, but you may have to pay a fee if you want to deposit cash. Certificates of Deposit The best CD rates may outpace any of the other accounts we've described above. That's because a certificate of deposit requires you to \"lock in\" your money for a predetermined amount of time ranging from three months to five years. To retrieve it before then, you'll pay a penalty (unless you opt for one of the best no-penalty CDs ). The longer you'll let the bank hold your money, the higher rate you'll get. CD rates aren't variable; the rate you get upon depositing your money is the rate you'll get for the length of your term. About CD Terms Locking your money into an account in exchange for a higher interest rate can be a big decision. Here's what you need to know about common CD terms. No-Penalty CDs Most CDs charge you a fee if you need to withdraw money from your account before the term ends. But with a no-penalty CD, you won't have to pay an early withdrawal penalty. The best no-penalty CDs will offer rates slightly higher than the best high-yield savings accounts , and can offer a substantially improved interest rate over traditional brick-and-mortar savings accounts. 6-Month CDs The best 6-month CDs are offering interest rates in the mid-5% range. Six-month CDs are best for those who are looking for elevated rates on their savings for short-term gains, but are uncomfortable having limited access to their cash in the long term. These can be a good option for those who may just be getting started with saving, or who don't have a large emergency fund for unexpected expenses. 1-Year CDs The best 1-year CDs tend to offer some of the top CD rates, and are a popular option for many investors. A 1-year term can be an attractive option for someone building a CD ladder , or for someone who has a reasonable cash safety net but is still concerned about long-term expenses. 2-Year CDs The best 2-year CD rates will be slightly lower than 1-year and no-penalty CD rates. In exchange for a longer lock-in period, investors receive a long-term commitment for a specific rate. These are best used as part of a CD ladder strategy, or for those worried about a declining rate market in the foreseeable future. 3-Year CDs The best 3-year CDs tend to have rates that are comparable to 2-year CDs. These are usually less popular for your average investor, but can be an important lever when diversifying investments and hedging against the risk of unfavorable rate markets in the long term. 5-Year CDs The best 5-year CDs will offer lower rates than the other terms on our list, but are still popular options for investors. These CDs are best for those looking to lock in high rates for the long term. CDs are generally viewed as safe investment vehicles, and securing a favorable rate can yield considerable earnings in year three and beyond \u2014 even if rates fall elsewhere.

A Texas man convicted of bludgeoning his wife to death with a nail gun has been sentenced to 40 years in prison. Lam Ngoc Tran, 65, pleaded guilty to murdering his wife, 49-year-old My Thai Dang, at their home on Peralta Springs Lane in Cypress, Texas, on Jan. 10, 2022, Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg announced Thursday. \"This is a horrible murder, and it reinforces that the most dangerous time for a battered spouse is when they are trying to leave the relationship,\" Ogg said. \"This woman was trying to get away from an abusive husband, and the only reason she is dead is because he could not stand to lose control of her.\" Harris County deputies responded to a 911 call at the couple's home and discovered Dang lying in a pool of her own blood after being attacked with a heavy pneumatic nail gun, the DA's office said. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

Tran was transported by a Life Flight helicopter to Memorial Hermann Hospital in the Texas Medical Center and survived his injuries.

        "description": "Daniil Medvedev ended Carlos Alcaraz's reign as the US Open champion by eliminating him in the semifinals 7-6 (3), 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 on Friday night to set up a rematch in the final against Novak Djokovic.",
        "content": "NEW YORK -- Daniil Medvedev predicted he would need to play \"11 out of 10\" to get past defending champion and top-seeded Carlos Alcaraz at the US Open. How did Medvedev rate his performance against Alcaraz in the semifinals Friday night? \"I played 12 out of 10,\" Medvedev declared after eliminating Alcaraz 7-6 (3), 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 to set up a rematch in the final against Novak Djokovic, a 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (4) winner over unseeded American Ben Shelton earlier Friday. The No. 3-seeded Medvedev won his lone major championship at Flushing Meadows in 2021 by defeating 23-time Slam winner Djokovic in that year's title match. That prevented Djokovic from completing what would have been the first calendar-year Grand Slam in men's tennis since 1969. Even before the start of these two weeks, folks had been anticipating a Djokovic vs. Alcaraz showdown for the title. Theirs is an intergenerational rivalry -- Djokovic is 36; Alcaraz 20 -- that has fascinated the tennis world in recent months. A meeting in New York on Sunday would have been a rematch of the final of the Cincinnati Masters last month, won by Djokovic, and of the final at Wimbledon in July, won by Alcaraz, and of a semifinal at the French Open in June, won by Djokovic. But it was not to be. Medvedev stood in the way. \"These kind of matches can happen,\" Alcaraz said. Alcaraz -- who will relinquish the No. 1 ranking to Djokovic no matter what happens on Sunday -- had been trying to become the first man to claim consecutive championships in New York since Roger Federer won five in a row from 2004 to 2008. Alcaraz spoke days earlier about his growth over the past year and how much more mature he's become. \"After this match, I'm going to change my mind,\" Alcaraz said. \"I'm not mature enough.\" So instead, it will be Medvedev, a 27-year-old from Russia, who will be appearing in his third US Open final in five years and his fifth major title match in all. He lost to Rafael Nadal in New York in 2019 and at the Australian Open in 2022, and to Djokovic at the Australian Open in 2021. \"The challenge is that you play a guy that won 23 Grand Slams, and I have only one,\" Medvedev said, looking ahead to taking on Djokovic. \"When I beat him here, I managed to play better than myself, so I need to do it again. There is no other way.\" Medvedev had lost to Alcaraz twice this season, including in the Wimbledon semifinals. Those head-to-head results left Medvedev concerned. \"Before the match, for sure, a lot of doubts,\" he said. But Medvedev was up to the task, defeating a world No. 1 for the sixth time -- the only active players with more wins over ATP No. 1s are Nadal (23), Djokovic (16) and Andy Murray (12) -- and continuing his unparalleled success on hard court. Since the start of 2018, nobody has recorded more match wins (235), final appearances (28) and titles (18) on hard courts than Medvedev. He stood way back to return serves and would conjure up passing shots \"from his house,\" Alcaraz observed with a smile, also noting that Medvedev hit his forehand harder than usual. One key moment: From 3-all in the opening tiebreaker, Medvedev grabbed the next four points and that set. \"I totally [lost] my mind,\" Alcaraz said. When Medvedev went up 3-0 in the second set, Alcaraz went to the sideline and thought about smacking his racket against a couple of plastic bottles on the floor near his seat, but held back. \"It was tough,\" Alcaraz said, \"for me to stay calm.\" There were moments of brilliance from both men, displays of athleticism, instincts and shot-making that brought fans out of their seats. Also often jumping up from his spot in a corner guest box at Arthur Ashe Stadium was Juan Carlos Ferrero, the 2003 French Open champion who is Alcaraz's coach. Ferrero was looking nervous throughout the second set as the match appeared to be getting away from his guy, keeping up a constant patter of instructions and exhortations in Spanish. It all helped, if only briefly. Alcaraz really got going in the third set, and his net-charging tactics -- including plenty of serve-and-volleying -- were effective. He won 54 of 70 points that he finished at the net. Medvedev served about as well as ever. He saved eight of the nine break points he faced and then often got the better of the match's shortest points, winning 101 of the 174 exchanges that lasted four strokes or fewer. \"Against someone like Carlos, you have to serve well,\" Medvedev said. \"You have no other choice.\" The final twist came with Alcaraz serving down 3-2 in the fourth set. It was a lengthy game that lasted nearly 15 minutes, filled with a ton of impressive returning by the lanky Medvedev, whose long arms seem to get his racket to everything. When one Medvedev return landed out, Alcaraz looked up and put his hands together, as if to say, \"Thank you!\" But Alcaraz missed one volley, and then couldn't quite deliver as he reached to try to get to a dipping, angled backhand return. \"That game was amazing,\" Medvedev would say later. It gave Medvedev the lead and an edge he would not relinquish, even if he did need to put aside a pair of double-faults while serving for the victory as some spectators called out to distract him. \"That's not so nice. But I'm happy it didn't help them,\" Medvedev said. \"They can go to sleep now.\" Alcaraz was asked how long he'll stew over this setback. \"Days? Weeks? I don't know,\" he responded. \"I don't think I'm going to think about this loss for a long time.\" ESPN Stats & Information and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The post 3 Under-the-Radar Stocks to Invest In for Big-Time, Long-Term Gains appeared first on InvestorPlace. More From InvestorPlace Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires. Here\u2019s How to Get In. ChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement It doesn\u2019t matter if you have $500 or $5 million. Do this now.",
        "content": "Half the fun of investing in stocks is digging through the markets to find undervalued gems and under-the-radar stocks with long-term potential. At the same time, markets are complex and the depth of information available is overwhelming. \u201cParalysis by analysis\u201d is a real affliction. It particularly affects newer investors as they learn how to separate the wheat from the chaff in under-the-radar stocks. As with any long-term investment strategy, three things matter. First, consider the broad economic conditions. Today, in an era of high(ish) interest rates and economic uncertainty, growth stocks and tech stocks are struggling. Depending on your risk appetite, this can present an opportunity to buy great stocks at bargain prices. Second, underlying fundamentals and financials matter \u2013 particularly in a tight economy. If a company can\u2019t withstand brief uncertainty based on its current financials, it doesn\u2019t matter how great its potential is. To that end, consider the long-term potential. Does the company have a viable product or service that\u2019s in demand and fairly protected from competition? These three companies have fundamental strength and long-term viability to weather (or even thrive) in today\u2019s economy. Each represents a perfect under-the-radar stock for those hunting for overlooked treasure. Under-the-Radar Stocks: Howmet Aerospace (HWM) Howmet Aerospace (NYSE: HWM ) is an aerospace company that manufactures and produces various materials and components for aircraft and aerospace end items. Of course, with space stocks set to hit a net value between $1 trillion and $10 trillion in the next few years, Howmet\u2019s long-term viability as a partner to major aerospace companies is clear. Today, Howmet ensures operational success through diversified products in the trucking industry. As global companies race to tighten up strained supply lines, trucking is a vital link in the chain. Likewise, by producing components for the trucks themselves, Howmet is vital to operational success even as trucking companies pivot to unmanned and autonomous operations . Howmet is financially successful and posted a profit in each of the past three years , with its most recent quarter marking a record $193 million net income . Its cash balance is also healthy, and the aerospace company has enough money to weather occasional down periods if they arise. SharkNinja (SN) SharkNinja (NYSE: SN ) is the definition of an under-the-radar stock, as it snuck onto exchanges via a spinoff in July to limited investor attention. The company might not be at the top of market players\u2019 minds, but it\u2019s a staple in kitchens and homes globally. The company makes and sells a range of appliances, including coffee makers, ice cream machines and hair dryers. Although firmly within consumer discretionary categories, the sluggish economy hasn\u2019t slowed SharkNinja. Instead, the company\u2019s sales have risen 20% each year since 2008. This year, management expects the trends to continue as trends point to $4 billion in revenue by December. Shares trade at a discount compared to similar, semi-luxury appliance brand competitors. Institutional investors are slowly taking note because of the company\u2019s broad appeal, proven strategy and financial readiness. One portfolio manager from Madison Avenue Partners said that SharkNinja is \u201ca gem that\u2019s about to be discovered,\u201d because \u201cSharkNinja has been able to produce new products in categories that haven\u2019t seen much innovation at attractive prices that delight consumers.\u201d Ultimately, any company able to sell higher-end discretionary products in today\u2019s economy is noteworthy. SharkNinja\u2019s success points to long-term upside potential for this under-the-radar stock. Robert Half Inc (RHI) The global job and labor market is changing, and firms like staffing agency Robert Half Inc (NYSE: RHI ) are positioned to ride the new trend to success. Notably, the company is pivoting away from low-margin activities, like temporary staffing solutions, and rotating into long-term contract sourcing. Notably, contract-to-hire models represent much higher margins for Robert Half. At the same time, they ensure a long-term revenue stream as the client and contractor\u2019s relationship matures. Likewise, these roles open opportunities for Robert Half to partner with more professional, skilled and experienced contractors. Ultimately, the move increases value to the client\u2019s organization and cements RHI\u2019s position in their workflow. Small business outsourcing is already booming, and digitization means Robert Half can deliver expertise to small business owners globally, no matter how remote the business is or how lacking local talent pools are. This demand makes matchmaking essential, and Robert Half is particularly well-suited to capitalize on emerging trends. This company and the ones listed above are all under-the-radar stocks that you should consider for your portfolio.

        "description": "She has never sorted her waitlist by insurance \u2014 at least not until now.",
        "content": "A procession of forlorn individuals extends from the dull reception area of a Billings government office all the way out the glass front doors and to the sidewalk outside. Each of them is armed with small stacks of documents and manila folders, and most are on their second or third trip to the Yellowstone County Office of Public Assistance where they are trying to restore the services they lost during the Medicaid unwinding. The \u201cunwinding\u201d describes the massive, federally mandated, reprocessing of every Medicaid recipient in the United States. It comes at the end of the three-year COVID-19 public health emergency, during which Congress enacted a requirement that states relax parameters around Medicaid eligibility. Medicaid programs were required to keep people continuously enrolled through the end of the emergency in exchange for enhanced federal funding. As a result, no one was reevaluated for Medicaid for three years, even if there was an increase in income or access to other health insurance. By the time the continuous enrollment requirement ended on March 31, 2023, there were more than 320,000 Montanans enrolled in Medicaid. Workers at the state health department will need to process every individual to either re-enroll them, or if they are no longer eligible bump them off the public insurance. So far, 55,000 people have lost coverage since April. Many unaware they're dropped After five months of unwinding, the redetermination process is going horribly across the country, including in Montana, said Mary Windecker, CEO of Behavioral Health Alliance of Montana. State data shows that 1,638 renewal packets were returned in the mail due to an incorrect address for the target individual and nearly 34,000 people lost coverage because of failure to provide requested information. Most people don\u2019t know that they\u2019ve fallen off Medicaid until they arrive in a provider\u2019s office, Windecker said. Amanda Medina has been trying for a month to get her children re-enrolled in Medicaid. She\u2019s waited on hold for hours just to be redirected to another department. She\u2019s receive contradictory information at every turn and taken at least two days off work to stand in line at the OPA. Her daughter has unique health issues that require treatment at the Children\u2019s Hospital in Denver, Colorado. \u201cShe has an appointment in October. I can\u2019t imagine if we got there and didn\u2019t have insurance,\u201d Medina said. Without Medicaid, Medina would run the risk of having to pay the full amount of the service out of pocket. Medina was aware that the unwinding was happening, but missed her redetermination paperwork in the mail. What she didn\u2019t realize was that her children would be affected by the unwinding. \u201cThere\u2019s lack of communication between departments. (Medicaid) has always been a headache, but this is a disaster,\u201d Medina said. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a pattern as to who falls through the cracks and who may be automatically re-enrolled, said Erica Schuppe, occupational therapist and owner of Wild Roots Therapy in Billings. Schuppe and her team of therapists spent at least six hours combing through their list of Medicaid patients, checking their enrollment status online, and calling the patient if they were listed as inactive. \u201cThe man power we\u2019ve put into this \u2026 I don\u2019t think smaller practices would be able to do it. And a lot of those practices in rural Montana are small,\u201d Schuppe said. Wild Roots offers occupational therapy, speech therapy, integrated listening systems and counseling with a focus on serving kids on Medicaid. The bulk of her clientele have experienced early life adversity such as abuse, neglect or exposure to violence. As these kids get older, they often present with, broadly speaking, behavioral problems. Schuppe has made it her mission to serve this patient population. She has never capped the number of Medicaid patients she takes, like many other providers. She has never sorted her waitlist by insurance. At least not until now. July was the first time in her career that she started looking for clients with private insurance, and it\u2019s because the state health department has been six-to-eight weeks behind on processing Medicaid claims since the unwinding began. The state government reimburses providers at a fixed rate for services delivered to a Medicaid recipient. In the past, the claims were processed and payment distributed in a timely manner, making it so Schuppe could continue on her mission. But with at least 180 Medicaid patients in the books per week, Schuppe can\u2019t afford to take anymore. \u201cI didn\u2019t fill my open spots with Medicaid patients, and it made me feel sick. It goes against my values, but I have 12 employees I have to pay,\u201d Schuppe said. At the same time, a multitude of claims are being denied because of noncompliance with the Passport to Health Program. This Medicaid program works to strengthen the relationship between a patient and a provider. The patient chooses one provider to manage all their referrals, and in order for the state government to pay for the service, the claim documentation must indicate that the Passport provider gave the referral. This program was suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the state health department did not adequately inform providers that the program would start back up this year, according to Schuppe. \u201cNo one was notified. Doctors weren\u2019t, therapists weren\u2019t, families weren\u2019t. These doctors are getting hundreds of calls a day now for referrals ... No one knew that this hiccup existed,\u201d Schuppe said. Providers throughout the state are capping the number of Medicaid patients they take. Others refuse to accept the public insurance at all. Families who have fallen off Medicaid have discontinued treatments for their children, Schuppe said. They don\u2019t want to accumulate medical debt in case they\u2019re unable to get back on Medicaid. During the final weeks of summer Schuppe usually focuses on getting her clients ready for the school year, working hard on things like fine motor skills and emotional regulation. But because of the Medicaid disruptions, many kids missed out on this. \u201cBeing unsafe as a little kid creates a plethora of developmental issues. That\u2019s why they come here, to get help with that,\u201d Schuppe said. \u201cSo to have additional stressors put on families is very sad to me.\u201d Jackie Jones, director of Montana government relations for PacificSource Health Plans, recalled a letter sent by the state health department to every Medicaid recipient in the state and the panic that followed. State officials aimed to inform enrollees of a different change to Medicaid, a change that is completely separate from the unwinding. \u201cThe letter was confusing, even for me,\u201d Jones said. \u201cPeople panicked, they thought they missed (the unwinding).\u201d The letter addressed the end of continuous eligibility, which keeps Medicaid recipients enrolled for 12-months before they are reevaluated. During the 2021 legislative session, state lawmakers voted to remove funding for continuous eligibility. Now, most adults covered by Medicaid will need to send proof of income to the state health department more frequently. This change, however, will not affect children. Between the unwinding and the end of continuous eligibility, there has been a misunderstanding around re-enrolling children for Medicaid, Jones said. Parents will need to return redetermination packets for their children in order to stay on Medicaid, but once the application is accepted, the kids will be covered for a year. \u201cWe all need to become helpers in getting services to people,\u201d Jones said, calling on others to help friends and family get their paperwork together and submitted. The most important thing to do now, Jones said, is to know the status of your Medicaid enrollment. Recipients can check online at . The website will show when the recipient should expect to see their redetermination packet in the mail. Contact information and addresses should be up-to-date online too. Upon receiving the packet, individuals will have about 30 days to return the information to the state health department. Even if the packet doesn\u2019t get in the mail right on time, Jones says to send in the information anyway. If it\u2019s close to the final day, the department might just process it anyway. For those who are no longer eligible because their employer offers health insurance benefits, there will open a temporary enrollment period in which you can apply for private insurance without a life changing event. A local group called partnered with the state health department to help people through the unwinding process. An enrollment assister will walk a client through the application process or help them identify other subsidized health insurance plans if they're no longer Medicaid eligible. \u201cReally I just want people to know that fight or flight is a normal human response to something stressful. It\u2019s a totally normal response to run away from that letter and its okay,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re lazy or stupid. There are still things you can do to get covered.\u201d",

        "content": "Have you ever considered growing your own cannabis plants? Imagine having your own supply of fresh, homegrown buds easily accessible to you. Whether you\u2019re a beginner or a seasoned grower looking to take your cannabis cultivation to the next level, this guide has got you covered. From choosing the right seeds to watching buds grow, we\u2019ll walk you through the exciting process of growing cannabis from seed to potent marijuana. Before we dive right into cannabis cultivation, it\u2019s crucial to understand the very foundation of it all \u2013 cannabis seeds. We\u2019ll cover the different types of seeds, the variety of strains, germination methods, and stages of growth. When it comes to regular weed seeds, you\u2019re in for a mix of possibilities. The sprouted seeds can grow into male or female weed plants, offering a variety of outcomes. Identifying and removing male plants is important to ensure your female plants can grow without interruptions. Regular weed seeds are great for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. Additionally, their steady growth pace makes them a good enough balance for both beginners and experienced growers alike. Regular cannabis seeds are perfect if you\u2019re interested in doing some experimentation, including creating your own unique strains. For those looking for simplicity and efficiency, are the best choice. These weed seeds guarantee only female plants, eliminating the need to identify male plants and remove them. Feminized weed seeds also grow cannabis a lot quicker compared to regular weed seeds. This makes feminized weed seeds a great choice for beginners and those aiming for a successful yield coupled with certainty and convenience, whether they\u2019re grown indoors or in a greenhouse. If patience isn\u2019t your strong suit, you may want to consider using . These weed seeds do not require specific light cycles to start flowering. They\u2019re compact in size, making them ideal for tight spaces and perfect for indoor cultivation. Newer growers will appreciate their low-maintenance nature, which means less stress and more buds. Photoperiod cannabis seeds require a touch of patience, control, and attention. With these seeds, you can manipulate the light cycles to your own advantage, guiding the weed plants through different stages of growth. While they demand a bit more of your attention, photoperiod seeds are likely to result in a variety of strains, each with its own unique flavor and effects. This choice is perfect for advanced to expert growers looking to create their own customized strains. Sour Diesel offers around 20% THC with a citrusy, fuel-like flavor. Its energetic effects include a burst of artistic ideas, an energy boost, and increased sociability, making it ideal for daytime use. It\u2019s favored by those seeking a pick-me-up during busy days, social gatherings, or creative sessions. In addition, Sour Diesel\u2019s THC content can also aid in managing stress and anxiety. White Widow has a balanced hybrid nature, with approximately 19% THC and a smooth, earthy flavor with a hint of sweetness. This strain delivers a joyful yet relaxing experience. This strain is best for winding down after a long day or enjoying a chill night with friends. Its moderate THC level makes it a recommended strain for beginners looking for relaxation without overwhelming effects. Blue Dream, containing around 18% THC, delivers relaxation and euphoria. This strain is versatile, making it suitable for daytime or evening use. It has a fruity and berry-like flavor profile, contributing to the overall experience. Blue Dream is a great choice for those seeking a balanced high without intense effects. OG Kush, a potent strain with roughly 20% THC, is best suited for experienced users, particularly those looking to relax. It has a distinct earthy and piney flavor with a hint of lemon. Because of its high THC content, it\u2019s not the most beginner-friendly option. It\u2019s best for evening use due to the soothing experience it offers. Gelato is a hybrid strain with around 20% THC that\u2019s generally great for both beginners and seasoned users. It has a sweet dessert-like flavor and provides a relaxed state and improved mood. Gelato is versatile and great for morning or evening use whenever you need a balanced, calming, and uplifting high. Northern Lights, containing around 18% THC, is an excellent choice for beginners seeking composure and tranquility. It has a sweet and spicy taste, with some options having a hint of pine and earthy flavors. Northern Lights offers a calming high that promotes relaxation and good sleep and is best enjoyed in the evening. AK-47, a Sativa-dominant hybrid strain with approximately 17% THC, is recommended for experienced users, particularly those seeking an energy boost. This makes it suitable for daytime use. It has a sweet and floral aroma and delivers an invigorating high that makes one more social, focused, and creative. Maui Wowie, with approximately 20% THC, provides a creative and mood-boosting experience. Ideal for both beginners and experienced users, this Sativa strain features a tropical and citrusy flavor and is best enjoyed during the day. Its flavor profile reminds users of pineapples and mangos, living up to its tropical name and source, with traces of origin strains from the island of Hawaii. Trainwreck is a Sativa strain that contains around 18% THC, with a sweet lemon and spicy, earthy flavor that matches its intense effects. It gives its users a rush of powerful euphoria and creativity, perfect for use during the day. Trainwreck encourages social interactions with its energetic effects. It provides potential therapeutic effects as well, relieving chronic pain and discomfort. Blue Cheese contains around 19% THC and is used for a mellow high that improves mood and encourages relaxation. It has a pungent aroma, similar to blue cheese, with a flavor that combines cheese and blueberry. Enjoy it in the evening as you wind down and destress. It\u2019s also known to help with sleep due to its calming effects. Exploring the world of growing cannabis seeds entails learning about and \u2013 two distinct strains that offer unique experiences for the user. Indica strains, commonly associated with relaxation, come from mountainous regions and thrive in colder climates. These compact weed plants feature broad leaves and hold the promise of delivering soothing effects. Indica strains are ideal for unwinding after a long and tiring day and for finding relief and comfort. On the other hand, Sativa strains hail from equatorial regions, growing their best in warm environments. Unlike the compact leaves of Indica, Sativa grows tall, narrow leaves and delivers invigorating effects. Sativa strains spark creativity, encourage sociability, improve mood, and boost energy. It\u2019s ideal for daytime use, giving a productive day a good kick-start. While Indica and Sativa strains are polar opposites, hybrid strains stand in the middle and offer a blend of both worlds. Hybrids inherit characteristics from their parent strains, resulting in a fusion of relaxation and energy. Their effects vary depending on the more dominant parent strain, opening up opportunities for customized cannabis experiences. When growing marijuana of different strains, keep their specific temperature needs in mind. Indica strains prefer cooler climates and tend to have shorter flowering periods, while Sativa strains like warmer temperatures and demand more patience due to their longer flowering cycles. Hybrids are a bit more challenging, requiring more attentive care due to their mixed traits. Usually, beginners tend to choose Indica strains for easier cultivation, while advanced growers lean toward Sativa strains. Additionally, seasoned growers with a lot of experience may test their skills with hybrids. Growing weed is an exciting journey with various stages that turn tiny seeds into thriving plants. It all begins with germination, where cannabis seeds wake up and start to grow roots. This phase takes about a few days to a week. The seeds soak up water, crack open their shells, and send roots down into the soil. Once the roots sprout, the cannabis seedling stage begins. In about 2 to 3 weeks, your plant grows its first real leaves alongside its tiny initial ones. This helps lay a strong foundation for the next stage, which is the vegetative stage. The vegetative stage lasts about 3 to 16 weeks. During this time, your cannabis plant focuses on growing leaves and stems. Giving it enough light and nutrients ensures the leaves are healthy and the plant is sturdy. After that, pre-flowering kicks in and lasts about 1 to 2 weeks. This is when you can tell if your plant is male or female. Female plants show tiny pistils, while males have pollen sacs. The most exciting part is flowering, which goes on for 6 to 12 weeks. The plant shifts its energy from growing to making buds, setting the stage for a great harvest. Remember, it\u2019s all about patience and careful attention throughout these stages. Keeping an eye on light, nutrients, and the environment makes sure your weed plants thrive. Above anything else, it\u2019s important to select high-quality seeds. Look for cannabis seeds that are plump, firm, and have a dark color. A healthy cannabis seed will have a slightly glossy appearance and feel solid to the touch. If your seeds are cracked, damaged, or too light in color, they might not germinate successfully. Opt for reputable cannabis seed banks or breeders to increase the likelihood of obtaining viable seeds that have been properly stored. Once you have your weed seeds ready, it\u2019s time to choose a germination method. There are several options to choose from: This popular method among beginners and seasoned growers alike involves placing weed seeds between damp paper towels and enclosing them in a plastic bag to let the seeds germinate. This creates a warm and humid environment ideal for germination. Check the paper towels regularly to ensure they remain moist but not soaked. Within a few days, you should see roots emerge, indicating successful germination. With this method, submerge your cannabis seeds in a glass of distilled water and let them soak. After about 24 to 48 hours, the seeds should sink to the bottom. This is your signal that they\u2019re ready to be planted. Putting the seeds in transparent water glasses helps you watch their development more closely. This approach is simple yet effective, making it a favorite among growers of all levels. Another option is to plant your cannabis seeds directly into your chosen growing medium. Ensure that the soil is adequately moist but not drenched in water. This method minimizes the risk of damaging delicate sprouts during the transplanting process, letting your seeds germinate in the final medium. Creating the right environment for germination is also crucial. Learn more about different environmental factors to consider below: Maintain a stable temperature of around 70-85\u00b0F to encourage optimal germination rates. Slight variations are acceptable, but drastic temperature changes can hinder or disrupt the whole process. Cannabis seeds do not require light to germinate; in fact, darkness often aids the process. However, once the roots emerge, providing gentle light will help prevent the seedlings from becoming weak. A humid environment promotes seed hydration and germination. A plastic bag or humidity dome can help maintain the necessary moisture levels during the initial stages. Keep in mind that there\u2019s a moisture level that you want to maintain, making sure that your seeds are not too dry or too damp. A big contributor to success is choosing the right growing medium. Soil, the traditional option, provides a forgiving environment for plants. On the other hand, hydroponics grants precise control over nutrient and water delivery. Coco coir, a natural fiber from coconut husks, combines water retention and aeration properties, making it an excellent alternative. Additionally, soilless mixes, composed of ingredients like perlite and vermiculite, provide improved drainage and aeration. Providing light to your weed plants effectively is essential for photosynthesis. Modern LED lights, known for energy efficiency and versatility, are favored by many growers. They emit specific light spectra that cater to different growth stages, promoting healthier and stronger marijuana. High-pressure sodium (HPS) lights shine during the flowering stage, giving a warm spectrum that enhances bud development. Compact Fluorescent Lights (CFL), affordable and suitable for smaller setups, are great for seedlings and young plants. Metal Halide (MH) lights are also popular and best for vegetative growth due to their blue spectrum. Maintaining optimal airflow. Installing ventilation systems, fans, and air filters may help establish a healthy growing environment for your marijuana. Inline fans expel stale air, while intake fans bring in fresh air. Carbon filters neutralize odors, which is essential for discreet cultivation. Climate control tools like heaters and dehumidifiers play a big role in maintaining consistent conditions throughout the growth stages, protecting plants from stress and diseases. Germination, being the very first step in your cannabis cultivation journey, is a critical process that sets the stage for healthy growth. The step-by-step process below ensures that your cannabis seeds get the best possible start. First, carefully select viable cannabis seeds that are plump, firm, and dark in color. These are the usual signs of healthy seeds that are more likely to germinate successfully. Once you\u2019ve gathered your cannabis seeds, you\u2019ll need some basic materials, depending on your germination method of choice. Over the next few days, you\u2019ll start to see tiny white taproots emerging from the germinated seeds. Once these taproots reach a length of around 0.5 to 0.75 inches, they\u2019re ready for the next stage. Carefully transfer the germinated cannabis seeds, taproot side down, into your chosen growing medium. This could be soil, coco coir, or any other suitable medium. To aid in their development, maintain a light cycle of 18 to 24 hours during germination, depending on the specific needs of your chosen cannabis seeds. This encourages the seedlings to stretch and establish themselves. As they grow, you\u2019ll witness the first signs of the true leaves, marking the beginning of your plants\u2019 journey. The phase after germinating cannabis seeds is a critical time for your seedlings. Providing attentive care during this period ensures that your seedlings establish strong roots for healthy growth. As your seedlings develop their first set of true leaves, it\u2019s time to consider their transition to larger containers. Transplanting provides them with more space for root expansion and growth. Choose containers with ample drainage holes to prevent overwatering. Gently lift the seedlings from their current medium, being careful not to damage the delicate roots. Place them in the new container at the same depth as before and fill in. This process reduces the risk of transplant shock. During the seedling stage, your weed plants will require specific nutrients for healthy growth. Opt for a balanced seedling nutrient mix with a higher proportion of nitrogen. Nitrogen supports the development of vibrant green leaves and robust stems. Begin with weaker doses of nutrients and gradually increase the strength as your seedlings grow. Overfeeding can lead to nutrient burn, so monitor your weed plants closely for any signs of stress or imbalance. Proper light and watering play huge roles in your seedlings\u2019 overall well-being. Maintain a gentle light intensity to prevent stretching stems. Research the specific light requirements of your chosen cannabis plant seeds to be informed about what\u2019s an optimal environment for them. Seedlings are prone to overwatering, so water carefully and in smaller quantities. Keep the growing medium slightly moist, allowing the top layer to dry out slightly between waterings. A spray bottle can be handy for misting seedlings, maintaining humidity, and preventing overwatering. It\u2019s inevitable to face certain challenges when cultivating marijuana, but being well-prepared and informed equips you to overcome them with confidence. The battle against pests and diseases is a constant one. Aphids, spider mites, and fungi like powdery mildew can all cause great damage to your cannabis plants. Regular inspection is key. Utilize integrated pest management techniques, including introducing beneficial insects to combat pests naturally. Neem oil and other organic treatments can also scare off invaders without harming your weed plants or compromising their end product. Your plants\u2019 health also relies on proper nutrient balance. Pale leaves and hindered growth could indicate nutrient deficiencies. Moreover, nutrient excesses can manifest in burnt leaf tips or an overly dark appearance. Be vigilant in monitoring your weed plants and adjust your nutrient regimen as needed. Investing in a quality nutrient solution that aligns with your plants\u2019 growth stages can also significantly reduce such risks. Environmental stressors, such as temperature fluctuations, humidity changes, and poor air circulation, can also lead to growth setbacks. Optimal conditions foster healthy development, so invest in reliable climate control systems. A combination of fans, heaters, and dehumidifiers helps maintain a stable environment. The legality of growing cannabis varies depending on the laws governing your region. Research and understand the laws and regulations on cannabis cultivation that apply in your area. Complying with local guidelines not only protects you from legal troubles but also contributes to being a responsible member of your community. It\u2019s also important to practice ethical and sustainable cultivation. Implement eco-friendly measures, such as composting, water conservation, and minimal use of synthetic chemicals, to reduce your environmental footprint. Safety is another primary consideration in the cultivation process. Establish fire prevention measures, especially if you\u2019re using high-intensity lighting systems. Properly ventilate your grow space to prevent mold growth and promote healthy air exchange. Moreover, working with cannabis plants may expose you to potential allergens and irritants. Wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves and eye protection, can mitigate health risks. Proper hygiene practices, such as washing hands thoroughly after handling plants, help to maintain a safe and healthy environment for both you and your plants. Properly dispose of plant waste and byproducts to prevent contamination and environmental harm. Composting plant material is an eco-friendly option. Lastly, cultivating cannabis plants may impact your neighbors and community. Remember to be respectful of their concerns and employ measures to minimize odors and disturbances.

The legality of growing marijuana at home may vary based on your jurisdiction. In some places, cultivating a limited number of weed plants for personal use is permitted, while others strictly prohibit home cultivation. It\u2019s crucial to research and understand your local laws and regulations on cultivation to be in the know about legal requirements before you grow cannabis. This ensures your safety and also contributes to responsible and ethical cultivation practices. The time it takes to grow marijuana from seed to harvest can vary depending on the strain, growing conditions, and cultivation techniques. Generally, it takes approximately 8 to 10 weeks for fast-flowering strains, while others may require up to 12 weeks or more. Note that autoflowering strains tend to have shorter growth periods, and some strains, particularly Sativas, may have longer flowering times. Regular monitoring and employing proper care practices throughout the growth stages play huge roles in achieving optimal yields and potent buds. For beginners, Indica-dominant strains are generally recommended as they have shorter flowering times and are less demanding in terms of attention. With sturdy structures, their growth traits are typically more forgiving. However, it\u2019s essential to remember that each strain has unique characteristics. While Indicas are generally the go-to choice in a broader sense, it\u2019s highly encouraged to conduct thorough research on specific strains before making a selection. Consider factors like growth requirements, effects, and potential challenges. Yes, you can grow cannabis seeds indoors in limited spaces.

Many users also believe that Gemini's verification process for withdrawals and transfers slows transactions. In November 2022, Genesis stopped Gemini Earn investors from withdrawing crypto from their accounts due to Genesis' lack of sufficient liquid assets to meet withdrawal requests. The Gemini Earn program was then terminated . In February 2022, a Gemini crypto hack led to the loss of roughly $37 million in assets of clients with crypto IRAs held through IRA Financial Trust. IRA Financial Trust sued Gemini, and both Gemini and IRA Financial Trusts became the targets of client lawsuits. On January 12, 2023, the SEC charged a complaint against Genesis and Gemini, claiming unregistered offer and sale of securities to retail investors through the Earn program.

It is hard to believe that it's been about 15 years since trading in bitcoin began. Crypto has exploded since then, with coins coming and going, not always quietly. IRS guidance from 2014 ( Notice 2014-21 ) says crypto is property, not currency. That means most transfers trigger taxes. You might be using it to pay for a new car, a cup of coffee or paying someone for services, either as an independent contractor or as an employee. But no matter what the transaction, you may have a gain or a loss. Whatever type or amount of crypto you use, the IRS will say you paid them the current market value of the crypto on that day. When you pay an independent contractor and issue a Form 1099, you can't enter a number of bitcoin on the form. You must put the value in U.S. dollars as of the time of payment. The contractor you pay might keep the crypto, or might sell it the same day, but that doesn't impact your taxes. The U.S. Treasury Department has proposed new rules to make it harder for people not to pay tax on their gains when they sell or trade crypto. Starting in 2026 for the 2025 tax year, crypto exchanges are required to report to the IRS and taxpayers in much the way brokerage firms now handle stock trades. The basic idea is that the crypto exchanges will send you and the IRS a Form 1099 keyed to your Social Security Number each year, reporting the total gross proceeds generated on your sales. You already get Form 1099 for many kinds of payments. They usually show up in your mailbox around Jan. 31, for the prior year. And if you receive a Form 1099 but don't put it on your tax return, it usually means that you'll get a tax bill from the IRS asking for their cut. The new reporting rules are not reporting your gain, mind you, but the gross amount in dollars your transactions represent. If you held your crypto for over a year to get long term capital gain treatment on your gains, the IRS tax rate is up to 23.8%. In contrast, if your gain is ordinary, the tax hit is up to 37%. Depending on where you live, you need to consider state taxes too. But how about your tax basis, who keeps track of that? The answer is that you have to. But the IRS and Treasury Department are thinking about this too. In addition to reporting gross proceeds starting in January 2026 for 2025 sales, the crypto exchanges will also have to start reporting your purchase price too\u2014your basis. That will make it even easier for the IRS to send you a tax bill if you forget to report your gain yourself. The new basis reporting kicks in early in 2027, when reporting sales made in 2026. But the rules would reach back only to crypto purchased in 2023 or later. But still, you can probably assume that there will be lots of zero basis reporting as these rules take effect. Is all this shocking? Hardly. The IRS has been after crypto for a long while now, even before 2014. But the IRS has had a hard time coming out with guidance, a hard time training its personnel how to audit crypto, and what to do with questionable cases. What if neither you nor your exchange know your tax basis? Maybe you bought your crypto long ago, and just don't know. Maybe it was a gift from your uncle Joe, but you don't know what he paid for it. Under IRS tax rules, when you receive property by gift, you take a carryover basis, meaning the basis that the giver of the property had. That way, if the person who made the gift has a low basis, you do too\u2014which will yield a bigger tax bite on your gain when you sell it. If your exchange doesn't know your basis, they will likely say zero basis. And that is the IRS rule too. If you can't prove your basis to the IRS, the IRS will assume that your basis is zero. \u00a9 Copyright IBTimes 2023. All rights reserved.

Following Sep 9, 2023, 08:21pm EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Google is testing three significant new Google Photos features SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Google is testing out a selection of new Google Photos features that can make it easier to share photos and videos with your partner, tidy up your photo library and make sure you don\u2019t miss important events. The details come, once again, from app expert AssembleDebug , now publishing their findings on their own blog. This information has been revealed through analyzing the underlying code of the Google Photos app, which can sometimes unearth inactive code snippets and text pertaining to unreleased features, such as those detailed below: Improvements To Partner Sharing A new sharing shortcut is being tested that would let you share an album with your partner in a single tap instead of having to navigate your way through the sharing menu to select your partner from a list. After nominating one of your contacts to be your partner from an initial setup screen, you will be able to share media directly with that person using a new shortcut. According to the report, this feature doesn\u2019t support adding more than one contact to your sharing shortcuts. Confusingly, the partner shortcut function is entirely different from the Google Photos \u201cPartner Sharing\u201d feature, which enables users to automatically share photos and videos with a partner\u2019s account as they are backed up. MORE FOR YOU How Deep Is Your Love McIntosh Launches Its Behemoth Of Bass Bang Olufsen Unveils Its New Beolab 8 Wireless Speaker An AI Created Song Is Looking To Make History With A Grammy Nomination Archive Albums Automatically Another new feature allows you to have albums automatically moved to the archive (see below) after a period of thirty days. Personally, I\u2019m not sure why users would want this feature, but Google clearly thinks it\u2019s important enough to warrant testing. What Is The Google Photos Archive? The Google Photos archive is a place where you can store albums, photos and videos that you don\u2019t want to have show up when scrolling through your library. It will also ensure that they don\u2019t appear in any automatically created movies or animations. For even greater security, you can move content to the Locked Folder instead, which locks your pictures behind an extra passcode challenge. Both the archive and the locked folder can now be backed up online . Calendar Integration - Reminders And Events Also lurking in the code are hints at a new function to create reminders in your Google Calendar directly from Google Photos. The code reveals the ability to create calendar events with configurable time, title and duration fields as well as a permission request message that reads: \u201cThe Google Photos app needs access to your calendar to let you create calendar events, like setting reminders. On the following screen, change your calendar permissions from Don\u2019t Allow to Allow.\u201d Again, it\u2019s not clear how Google would use this ability; perhaps there could be integration between the Google Photos \u201cMemories\u201d feature and Google Calendar or, as AssembleDebug postulates, the ability to scan photos for appointments and invitations and automatically convert them into calendar events. For example, you could take a photo of an appointment letter or party invitation and have Google Calendar automatically send you timely reminders without you having to enter the information manually. Both auto-archiving and Google Photos reminders are likely to appear as exclusives for paying Google One customers, given that text within the app code reads, \u201cAs a Google One member, you can unlock reminders, auto-archive, and more.\u201d It\u2019s important to remember that these features aren\u2019t currently enabled in the Google Photos app and, as they are just tests, may be subject to significant change\u2014if they ever roll out at all. I certainly hope they do, though. The partner shortcut alone would eliminate a lot of repetitive effort, and who knows what important meetings the reminder function might save you from missing?

        "content": "BOSTON \u2014 Most major car manufacturers admit they may be selling your personal information \u2014 though they are vague on the buyers, a new study finds, and half say they would share it with the government or law enforcement without a court order. The proliferation of sensors in automobiles \u2014 from telematics to fully digitized control consoles \u2014 has made them prodigious data-collection hubs. But drivers are given little or no control over the personal data their vehicles collect, researchers for the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation said in their latest \u201cPrivacy Not Included\u201d survey. Security standards are also vague, a big concern given automakers\u2019 track record of susceptibility to hacking. \u201cCars seem to have really flown under the privacy radar and I\u2019m really hoping that we can help remedy that because they are truly awful,\u201d said Jen Caltrider, the study\u2019s research lead. \u201cCars have microphones and people have all kinds of sensitive conversations in them. Cars have cameras that face inward and outward.\u201d Unless they opt for a used, pre-digital model, car buyers \u201cjust don\u2019t have a lot of options,\u201d Caltrider said. Cars scored worst for privacy among more than a dozen product categories \u2014 including fitness trackers, reproductive-health apps, smart speakers and other connected home appliances \u2014 that Mozilla has studied since 2017. Not one of the 25 car brands whose privacy notices were reviewed \u2014 chosen for their popularity in Europe and North America \u2014 met the minimum privacy standards of Mozilla, which promotes open-source, public interest technologies and maintains the Firefox browser. By contrast, 37% of the mental health apps the nonprofit reviewed this year did. Nineteen automakers say they can sell your personal data, their notices reveal. Half will share your information with government or law enforcement in response to a \u201crequest\u201d \u2014 as opposed to requiring a court order. Only two \u2014 Renault and Dacia, which are not sold in North America \u2014 offer drivers the option to have their data deleted. The automakers are vague on disclosing to whom they are selling what they collect, though the researchers have little doubt it includes data brokers, marketers and dealers. Partners with installed products and services, including SiriusXM, Google Maps and Onstar, are also amassing data. \u201cIncreasingly, most cars are wiretaps on wheels,\u201d said Albert Fox Cahn, a technology and human rights fellow at Harvard's Carr Center for Human Rights Policy. \u201cThe electronics that drivers pay more and more money to install are collecting more and more data on them and their passengers.\" \u201cThere is something uniquely invasive about transforming the privacy of one\u2019s car into a corporate surveillance space,\u201d he added. A trade group representing the makers of most cars and light trucks sold in the U.S., the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, took issue with that characterization. In a letter sent Tuesday to U.S. House and Senate leadership, it said it shares \u201cthe goal of protecting the privacy of consumers.\u201d It called for a federal privacy law, saying a \u201cpatchwork of state privacy laws creates confusion among consumers about their privacy rights and makes compliance unnecessarily difficult.\u201d The absence of such a law lets connected devices and smartphones amass data for tailored ad targeting and other marketing \u2014 while also raising the odds of massive information theft through cybersecurity breaches. The Associated Press asked the Alliance, which has resisted efforts to provide car owners and independent repair shops with access to onboard data, if it supports allowing car buyers to automatically opt out of data collection \u2014 and granting them the option of having collected data deleted. Spokesman Brian Weiss said that for safety reasons the group \u201chas concerns\u201d about letting customers completely opt out \u2014 but does endorse giving them greater control over how the data is used in marketing and by third parties. In a 2020 Pew Research survey, 52% of Americans said they had opted against using a product or service because they were worried about the amount of personal information it would collect about them. On security, Mozilla's minimum standards include encrypting all personal information on a car. The researchers said most car brands ignored their emailed questions on the matter, those that did offering partial, unsatisfactory responses. Japan-based Nissan astounded researchers with the level of honesty and detailed breakdowns of data collection its privacy notice provides, a stark contrast with Big Tech companies such as Facebook or Google. \u201cSensitive personal information\u201d collected includes driver's license numbers, immigration status, race, sexual orientation and health diagnoses. Further, Nissan says it can share \u201cinferences\u201d drawn from the data to create profiles \"reflecting the consumer\u2019s preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes.\u201d It was among six car companies that said they could collect \u201cgenetic information\u201d or \u201cgenetic characteristics,\" the researchers found. Nissan also said it collected information on \u201csexual activity.\" It didn't explain how. The all-electric Tesla brand scored high on Mozilla\u2019s \u201ccreepiness\u201d index. If an owner opts out of data collection, Tesla\u2019s privacy notice says the company may not be able to notify drivers \u201cin real time\u201d of issues that could result in \u201creduced functionality, serious damage, or inoperability.\u201d",

[+] (Photo by Phil Barker/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Future Publishing via Getty Images Writing on X , the social network formerly known as Twitter, noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo writes : \u201cit seems that Apple will not launch new MacBook models (equipped with M3 series processors) before the end of this year.\" This will come as a shock to many. Apple\u2019s M3 platform is widely expected to be the first Mac chipset built using 3nm technology instead of the current 5nm. This should offer improved battery life and reduced operating temperatures. The next generation of Apple Silicon is currently being tested and spotted in third-party developer logs and online benchmarking tools, alongside details on the M3 laptops working through the sloppy chain. Those laptops, the popular 13-inch MacBook Air and the kooky consumer-focused 13-inch MacBook Pro , were expected to debut the M3 chipset at a launch event in mid- to late-October, potentially alongside a similarly upgraded iMac. It\u2019s worth noting that Kuo only talks about the MacBook, rather than the desk-bound iMac, which leads to an interesting possibility. In previous launches, Apple Silicon has debuted on the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Both of these are popular machines which will be in high demand when they go on sale.

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Example of generative AI getty 75% of people who use generative AI use it for work and 70% of Gen Z uses new generative AI technologies, according to a new 4,000-person survey by Salesforce, which has been integrating AI into its products for years. Also found: 68% of those who haven\u2019t tried generative AI are Gen X or boomers. \u201cThere\u2019s a generative AI divide,\u201d says Salesforce senior director of product marketing Kelly Eliyahu. \u201c49% of the population has used it, and 51% has never used it.\u201d Generative AI has been around for a long time, with generative models dating back as far as 1972 , according to Intel AI expert Ilke Demir. But it has burst onto the popular consciousness with the emergence of OpenAI with ChatGPT and visual creations from technologies like Creative Diffusion, MidJourney, and Adobe Firefly. Apparently, more for some people than others. For those who use the new technology, a third use it every day, Eliyahu says, while the rest use it weekly or more. Most are looking to automate work tasks, while about a third use it for fun, and a third use generative AI for learning about topics that interest them. The generative AI divide is largely a generational divide. Non-believers tend to be older and more cautious around new technology. 68% of non-users are Gen X or baby boomers, and almost nine out of 10 non-users don\u2019t see how generative AI will impact their life, and 40% says they aren\u2019t familiar with the technology. That\u2019s unfortunate, because that means that the oldest people in the population\u2014who are most vulnerable to non-online shopping scams\u2014don\u2019t understand existing uses of deepfakes created with generative AI for financial and political scams. Another third of non-users say the technology is not useful for them Those who use generative AI, however, see plenty of benefits: 46%: saves time 42%: easy to use 37%: fun to use 35%: teaches new things 32%: helps with complex concepts 29%: help make decisions quicker 28%: helps make more informed decisions 28%: keeps me more organized 26%: provides inspiration 22%: helps me succeed at work MORE FOR YOU Prompt Engineering Embraces Tree-Of-Thoughts As Latest New Technique To Solve Generative AI Toughest Problems The Amazing Ways Coca Cola Uses Generative AI In Art And Advertising More Back-To-Office Mandates, AI \u2018Agents\u2019 And WeWork\u2019s Future According to the survey, people would use generative AI more if it was more secure and safe, if they understood it better and knew more about how to use it, and if it was integrated into the technology they already use. People who do use generative AI mostly say it\u2019s improved even as they\u2019ve been using it and almost 90% say the results of generative AI models have met or exceeded their expectations. \"This data shows just how quickly generative AI usage has taken off in less than a year,\" Clara Shih, CEO of Salesforce AI, said in a statement. \"In my career, I\u2019ve never seen a technology get adopted this fast.

In a comprehensive report , Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman has detailed the size, weight, design changes, battery life and camera capabilities of various iPhone 15 models. Let\u2019s break them down. Size - Gurman claims that the iPhone 15 Pros\u2019 new titanium chassis will result in a 10% weight reduction. While this doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, it means the iPhone 15 Pro could weigh just 185g, down from 206g, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max would clock in at 216g, down from 240g. Having the iPhone 15 Pro Max weigh little more than the iPhone 14 Pro is a massive difference. Design \u2014 Gurman also reveals that the Pro\u2019s titanium chassis will have a brushed finish to reduce fingerprints, and smooth, rounded corners replace the hard edges of their predecessors. The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max displays also look noticeably larger due to a one-third reduction in their bezel sizes. All iPhone 15 models will have a more repairable design, with Apple recently backing California\u2019s right-to-repair bill. Render of Apple's iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro designs and color options based on leaks @theapplehub Battery Life & Charging - While not providing numbers, Gurman claims the iPhone 15 Pros\u2019 A17 Bionic chip will deliver more battery life than the 23-29 hours offered by the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max, respectively. Wireless charging will also be faster for all iPhone 15 models.

The U2 will have improved location tracking (to help it find what it\u2019s looking for? Sorry, couldn\u2019t resist ). Branding - The iPhone 15 Pro Max will not change its name to the \u2018 iPhone 15 Ultra ,\u2019 despite numerous rumors. Industry observers claim the switch is now expected to occur with the iPhone 16 lineup in 2024. Cameras - For the first time, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will have telephoto (zoom) and ultra-wide cameras with more than 12 megapixels. However, Gurman doesn\u2019t provide a number. The Pro Max\u2019s exclusive periscopic zoom lens will deliver up to 6x optical zoom. Periscope lenses use a mirror so the lenses can be mounted sideways inside the phone to reduce the ... [+] camera hump Samsung Gurman also backs several previously reported leaks for the range: the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will have the iPhone 14 Pro\u2019s A16 Bionic chip, 48-megapixel camera and Dynamic Island design. While the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will have more RAM, something recently confirmed by TrendForce . At this point, we know almost everything about the iPhone 15 lineup, including Apple\u2019s higher prices for Pro models . Perhaps the only question left is whether the troubled iPhone 15 Pro Max will be released at the same time as the rest of the range or fall victim to widely expected delays .

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin iPhone 15 Pro Max renders based on multiple leaks @HansTSaiz The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will cost more than any previous iPhone, and we know the reasons why . But now, a new leak has made these increases harder to justify. A new report from research firm TrendForce has revealed that neither of the iPhone 15 Pro models will receive the storage upgrades widely anticipated. This means Apple will again release the Pros with 128GB of base storage, despite almost all rivals giving their flagships 256GB. Instead, Apple will offer 256GB, 512GB and 1TB storage as upgrade options. This is a hugely risky decision. With the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max expected to start at $1,099 and $1,199, respectively, this means prices for 1TB models could be as high as $1,600 for the Pro and $1,700 for the Pro Max. This will be a blow to iPhone fans after leaks suggested that the Pros\u2019 $100 price increase could be evened out by more generous storage capacities. Moreover, component cost differences between 128GB and 256GB are negligible these days, and the iPhone 15 Pros are expected to ship with 8K video recording, a mode that can eat up to 600MB per minute.

That\u2019s up from the 6GB in the iPhone 14 Pro models, but memory management was never in question with those phones, so I suspect most users would\u2019ve preferred to see that expenditure go towards more generous storage tiers. On the flip side, the iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max will get significantly more upgrades than standard iPhone 15 models. While the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are essentially iPhone 14 Pros at a lower price (A16 chip, Dynamic Island design, 48MP camera), the Pro models have titanium chassis, record-breaking bezels , Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports and a 3nm A17 chip. The iPhone 15 Pro Max will also exclusively get Apple\u2019s first 10x optical zoom camera , which is expected to be the biggest selling point in the range. That said, availability of the Pro Max is understood to be extremely limited at launch, with reports claiming it may be delayed by up to a month . Note: For those unsure about upgrading, a bigger iPhone redesign is tipped for 2024 . Maybe, just maybe, Apple will give us more generous storage options then.

        "description": "Avoiding generative AI security tools due to fear, uncertainty and doubt may be more of a risk than diving headlong into the conversation.",
        "content": "Head over to our on-demand library to view sessions from VB Transform 2023. Register Here The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI has presented new challenges for security teams everywhere. In creating new ways for data to be accessed, gen AI doesn\u2019t fit traditional security paradigms focused on preventing data from going to people who aren\u2019t supposed to have it. To enable organizations to move quickly on gen AI without introducing undue risk, security providers need to update their programs, taking into account the new types of risk and how they put pressure on their existing programs. An entire industry is currently being built and expanded on top of LLMs hosted by such services as OpenAI, Hugging Face and Anthropic. In addition, there are a number of open models available such as LLaMA from Meta and GPT-2 from OpenAI. Access to these models could help employees in an organization solve business challenges. But for a variety of reasons, not everybody is in a position to access these models directly. Instead, employees often look for tools \u2014 such as browser extensions, SaaS productivity applications, Slack apps and paid APIs \u2014 that promise easy use of the models. VB Transform 2023 On-Demand Did you miss a session from VB Transform 2023? Register to access the on-demand library for all of our featured sessions. These intermediaries are quickly becoming a new source of shadow IT. Using a Chrome extension to write a better sales email doesn\u2019t feel like using a vendor; it feels like a productivity hack. It\u2019s not obvious to many employees that they are introducing a leak of important sensitive data by sharing all of this with a third party, even if your organization is comfortable with the underlying models and providers themselves. This type of risk is relatively new to most organizations. Three potential boundaries play into this risk: In each of these cases, the issue is understanding what data is going into a model. Only the individuals with access to the training, or fine-tuning, data should have access to the resulting model. As an example, let\u2019s say that an organization uses a product that fine-tunes an LLM using the contents of its productivity suite. How would that tool ensure that I can\u2019t use the model to retrieve information originally sourced from documents I don\u2019t have permission to access? In addition, how would it update that mechanism after the access I originally had was revoked? These are tractable problems, but they require special consideration. While privacy considerations aren\u2019t new, using gen AI with personal information can make these issues especially challenging. In many jurisdictions, automated processing of personal information in order to analyze or predict certain aspects of that person is a regulated activity. Using AI tools can add nuance to these processes and make it more difficult to comply with requirements like offering opt-out. Another consideration is how training or fine-tuning models on personal information might affect your ability to honor deletion requests, restrictions on repurposing of data, data residency and other challenging privacy and regulatory requirements. Vendor security, enterprise security and product security are particularly stretched by the new types of risk introduced by gen AI. Each of these programs needs to adapt to manage risk effectively going forward. Here\u2019s how. The starting point for vendor security when it comes to gen AI tools is to treat these tools like the tools you adopt from any other vendor. Ensure that they meet your usual requirements for security and privacy . Your goal is to ensure that they will be a trustworthy steward of your data. Given the novelty of these tools, many of your vendors may be using them in ways that aren\u2019t the most responsible. As such, you should add considerations into your due diligence process. You might consider adding questions to your standard questionnaire, for example: Your due diligence may take another form, and I\u2019m sure many standard compliance frameworks like SOC 2 and ISO 27001 will be building relevant controls into future versions of their frameworks. Now is the right time to start considering these questions and ensuring that your vendors consider them too. Each organization has its own approach to the balance between friction and usability. Your organization may have already implemented strict controls around browser extensions and OAuth applications in your SaaS environment. Now is a great time to take another look at your approach to make sure it still strikes the right balance. Untrusted intermediary applications often take the form of easy-to-install browser extensions or OAuth applications that connect to your existing SaaS applications. These are vectors that can be observed and controlled. The risk of employees using tools that send customer data to an unapproved third party is especially potent now that so many of these tools are offering impressive solutions using gen AI. In addition to technical controls, it\u2019s important to set expectations with your employees and assume good intentions. Ensure that your colleagues know what is appropriate and what is not when it comes to using these tools. Collaborate with your legal and privacy teams to develop a formal AI policy for employees. The biggest change to product security is ensuring that you aren\u2019t becoming an untrusted middleman for your customers. Make it clear in your product how you use customer data with gen AI. Transparency is the first and most powerful tool in building trust. Your product should also respect the same security boundaries your customers have come to expect. Don\u2019t let individuals access models trained on data they can\u2019t access directly. It\u2019s possible in the future there will be more mainstream technologies to apply fine-grained authorization policies to model access, but we\u2019re still very early in this sea change. Prompt engineering and prompt injection are fascinating new areas of offensive security, and you don\u2019t want your use of these models to become a source of security breaches. Give your customers options, allowing them to opt in or opt out of your gen AI features. This puts the tools in their hands to choose how they want their data to be used. At the end of the day, it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t stand in the way of progress. If these tools will make your company more successful, then avoiding them due to fear, uncertainty and doubt may be more of a risk than diving headlong into the conversation.

Apple Loop is here to remind you of a few of the very many discussions that have happened around Apple over the last seven days ( and you can read my weekly digest of Android news here on Forbes ). TIANJIN, CHINA - 2022/10/12: A customer is trying an iPhone 14 Pro Max in an Apple store. On ... [+] October 7, the iPhone 14 series were launched in the Chinese Mainland market. According to the latest report, Apple Inc. will cancel the plan to increase the production of 6 million iPhones 14 series because the demand is lower than expected. (Photo by Zhang Peng/LightRocket via Getty Images) LightRocket via Getty Images Update: September 9th: A Closer Look With The iPhone 15 Pro Max One final weekend ahead of the iPhone 15 launch and details on Apple\u2019s upgrades to the camera have leaked. While all four models will pick up new hardware - such as the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus moving to a 48-megapixel sensor, and new telephoto and ultrawide lenses for the iPhone 15 Pro - there is a significant upgrade for the top-end flagship. The iPhone 15 Pro Max is doubling the optical zoom: \"The iPhone 15 Pro models will continue to have three cameras, including a 48-megapixel sensor. There are new telephoto and ultrawide lenses with more megapixels than in last year\u2019s Pro sensors, and the company is planning to tout the enhancements as the premier additions in this year\u2019s phones.

This will double the iPhone\u2019s ability to zoom into images \u2014 with the physical lens itself, rather than software \u2014 from 3X magnification to around 6X.\" ( Bloomberg ). New Availability Issues Around iPhone 15, Delays Possible Apple\u2019s iPhone launch event takes place next week, and while the four smartphones in the iPhone 15 family will take to the stage, it may take longer than expected for customers to buy their new handsets. Because of various production issues, the number of handsets available is going to be lower than expected: \u201c[Apple analyst] Ming-Chi Kuo reveals that Apple is experiencing significant issues with producing camera sensors for standard iPhone 15 models and the titanium chassis of the Pros, plus delays in manufacturing the flagship iPhone 15 Pro Max. Perhaps the biggest shock is the new stacked CIS primary camera for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. Kuo states that Apple tried to resolve its production issues by increasing volume, but up to 15% of regular models are still affected.\" ( Forbes ). Not only are stocks going to be lower across the board, but the iPhone 15 Pro Max - which Apple expected to make up 30 to 40 percent of the combined iPhone 15 sales - is going t to be delayed by up to a month, leaving it until late October before going on wide retail sale: \u201cThe yield issues with Sony, the supplier of image sensors for the iPhone 15 Pro Max, are severe. As a result, the release date of the iPhone 15 Pro Max could be delayed by up to approximately 4 weeks.\u201d ( Forbes ). 14 Days To Go The delays aren\u2019t stopping Apple\u2019s marketing machine spooling up to get the attention of everyone outside of the usual geekerati circles. One of those is the now-tradition YouTube countdown clock to the moment the Apple Store doors open: \"It's another small step down the road that ends on Friday, September 22 with the release of the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra second generation. That\u2019s when they\u2019re all expected to land on Apple Store shelves. It also looks like new AirPods Pro will be revealed at the keynote and put on sale with the iPhones and Watches.\" ( Forbes ). \u2026and if you are looking for a comprehensive timeline for the launches, David Phelan has you covered ( Forbes ). Get Ready For A Price Rise Fans of the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are getting ready to pay a little more for their new iOS smartphones. The latest leaked price details suggest that there is going to be a significant mark-up on the handsets, with the new build materials and optical hardware shouldering much of the blame: \"In previous reports, titanium has been cited as a big cost increase for Apple, but with claims that the iPhone 15 Pro would not jump in price, it appeared this wouldn\u2019t be passed on to end users. Throw in the cost of Apple\u2019s first 10x optical zoom camera, and this aligns with claims that the iPhone 15 Pro Max could rise by as much as $200, becoming the most expensive iPhone ever released.\" ( Forbes ). Would Apple Risk Launching A Cheaper MacBook This week, a few signs were picked up from the supply chain suggesting that Apple is preparing a cheaper MacBook to take on the Chromebook. Scheduled for late next year, it would be a courageous choice for Apple to go below the recognised $999 mark: \"The most significant risk would be to Apple\u2019s brand. While there have been \u2018cheaper\u2019 products built around the value proposition launched in the past - the iPhone 5C immediately spins to mind - the lure of Apple is to be a part of the in-crowd, to buy into the dream of products that offer more than the norm, and to feel that your money is purchasing a quality product.\" ( Forbes ). Apple's European Gatekeepers Three of Apple\u2019s key properties have been marked as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d by the European Union. In essence, the App Store, the Safari browser, and iOS have a market strength that will attract more regulations to ensure they do not distort the competition. \"The EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) seeks to curtail the power of major tech companies. Designated \"gatekeeper\" platforms will now face prohibition against favoring their own services over those of rivals. These platforms will also be prevented from combining personal data across different services and will have to allow users the option to download apps from alternative platforms.\" ( MacRumors ). And Finally... Apple\u2019s stock has seen a notable fall this week following restrictions placed on Chinese government officials' use of iPhones. \"Investors are fretting over the ability of the world\u2019s most valuable public company to do business in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Apple notched its largest daily fall in over a month on Wednesday. The company lost about $200 billion in two days, and its stock is currently the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\" ( CNN ).

        "content": "Forbes Innovation Consumer Tech Android Circuit: Google Confirms Pixel 8, Microsoft Remembers Surface Duo, Honor Magic V2 Wins IFA Ewan Spence Senior Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Storyteller exploring digital worlds, mobile, music and podcasting Following Sep 9, 2023, 01:18pm EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Pixel Watch 2 confirmed specifications added, September 9th; article originally posted September 8th Taking a look back at seven days of news and headlines across the world of Android, this week\u2019s Android Circuit includes Google\u2019s official preview, Pixel 8 Pro details, Galaxy Z Fold 5 lessons, Galaxy S4 Ultra camera leaks, Honor Magic V2 Wins IFA, Microsoft Remembers Surface Duo, Xiaomi\u2019s increased Android support, and Android\u2019s new design. Android Circuit is here to remind you of a few of the many things that have happened around Android in the last week (and you can find the weekly Apple news digest here). Made By Google Teaser Video It may be a month away, but Google is building up some PR momentum around the \u201cMade By Google\u201d event on October 4th. The Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Watch 2, and Pixel Buds Pro 2 all appeared in Google\u2019s teaser video released earlier this week. We didn\u2019t get a look at the software, but the design was on full show: \"As expected, one of the two leaked color schemes is prominent in the video. The leaked \u201c Porcelain\" color that first appeared on one of the Google Store\u2019s internal pages last week is very much on show. What we don\u2019t see is any software running on the Pixel 8\u2019s screen.\" ( Forbes ). MORE FOR YOU Apple Leak Details All-New iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro Price Changes iOS 16 6 1 Update Now Warning Issued To All iPhone Users What To Know About IOS 16 6 1 Apple s Emergency Software Update Pixel 8 Pro Features That\u2019s not to say that extra details haven\u2019t leaked out away from the official videos. As well as the new colors, the temperature sensor, and the improved Tensor Mobile chipset, you have smaller details that will add to the value: \"The Pixel 8 Pro is also said to ship with a telephoto lens with a 5x zoom, though the features section does not specify if \u20185x\u2019 is lossless zoom or a combination of optical and digital zoom. Other additions such as NFC, mmWave antenna cover, and several microphones will find their way to the flagship.\" ( WCCFTech ). Update: September 9th: Pixel Watch 2 Specs Confirmed Part of Google\u2019s teaser video for the launch event saw a brief moment of the Pixel Watch 2, Google\u2019s second wearable under the Pixel brand. The company has now given the Watch pride of place in its own teaser video. Not only is the new digital crown on show, but the look at the rear panel shows an engraved IP68 rating alongside a raft of sensors: \u201c...the array of sensors seems to have been redesigned. While there could be any number of reasons for this, it adds credence to the suggestion that the Pixel Watch 2 will inherit the Fitbit Sense 2\u2019s continuous electrodermal activity sensor for measuring stress.\" ( Tom\u2019s Guide ). Folds, Z Folds, And Android Software Google\u2019s Pixel Fold may grab the attention, but Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold range is now in its fifth iteration. What software lessons can Samsung teach Google and, in turn, have them roll out across Android\u2019s large-screened devices? Mishaal Rahman suggests starting with multitasking: \"The Pixel Fold, in contrast, doesn\u2019t even have a search bar in its taskbar (yet), so it\u2019s awkward to select a second split-screen app when you initiate split-screen mode from the recents menu. Google\u2019s software does, at least, let you launch apps in split-screen mode from the home screen, unlike One UI. On the other hand, Google\u2019s software lacks arguably the best feature for split-screen multitasking: saving app pairs.\" ( Android Central ). An Ultra Camera For An Ultra Phone While the attention is on Google, details on Samsung\u2019s next flagship Galaxy handset have leaked. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is leaning heavily into the camera with some new technology expected: \"More notable is the claimed camera spec. The provision of a 200MP main sensor, a 12MP ultra-wide (presumably), and a 10MP telephoto is in keeping with the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, but this list appears to confirm previous claims that the S24 Ultra is set for a new 50MP 3x telephoto camera.\" ( Yogesh Brar via Trusted Reviews ). Honor Magic V2 Wins IFA Last week\u2019s IFA trade show in Berlin saw countless new consumer electronics previewed and launched. Naturally, there were some standouts, with Honor\u2019s second foldable smartphone picking up many \u201cbest in show\u201d awards. \"The Magic V2 offers larger displays inside and out than the obvious comparable models from Samsung and Google, but remains slimmer and lighter than both. It's also got a larger battery using cutting-edge silicon-carbon technology and upgraded camera sensors befitting a flagship phone. And if the current Honor Magic Vs is anything to go by, it'll be quite a bit cheaper than a Samsung or Google foldable in the markets where it's available.\" ( Tom\u2019s Guide ). Surface Duo Not Forgotten This week saw a surprising announcement from Microsoft. For all of the lack of action around the Android-powered Surface Duo, a new search function has been added to the folding dual-screened mobile device. Is it too little, too late, given the rise of foldable devices that have met and exceeded the promise of the Duo? \u201cAwesome new feature available for Surface Duo users - start a Bing Chat conversation from anywhere you find search on your Surface Duo or in Microsoft Launcher. \" ( Twitter ) Microsoft Surface Duo and Surface Duo 2. Ewan Spence Xiaomi Increases Android Support Another manufacturer has announced an increased support window for software. This week it is the turn of Xiaomi to push out to five years, extending the secure life of their latest smartphone: \"We are proud to announce a significant enhancement to our commitment to providing exceptional software support. Xiaomi 13T and Xiaomi 13T Pro will include 4 generations of Android OS upgrades, as well as 5 years of security patches.\" ( Xiaomi on Twitter ). And Finally... Google has refreshed the look and feel of the Android branding. The latest blog post goes into the design details for those wondering why small changes can have so much impact. \"With this update, you\u2019ll notice some subtle changes that help connect Android to Google. In addition to moving away from our longstanding lowercase stylization of \u201candroid,\u201d we\u2019re elevating the Android logo by capitalizing the \u201cA,\u201d adding more weight to its appearance when placed next to Google\u2019s logo. While we\u2019ve added more curves and personality unique to Android, the new Android stylization more closely mirrors Google\u2019s logo and creates balance between the two.\" ( Google Blog ).

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL is set to unveil its latest innovations , including the much-anticipated iPhone 15 series, at its \"Wonderlust\" event scheduled for September 12. What Happened: The event promises to showcase not just the new iPhone lineup but also updates to the Apple Watch and AirPods, along with upcoming software updates. At the forefront of the unveiling is the iPhone 15 Pro line, which is expected to be the star of the show. The tech giant is also gearing up to introduce advancements in iOS 17, iPadOS 17 and watchOS 10. The event is crucial as the iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods collectively constitute about 60% of Apple's total revenue, not accounting for the earnings from digital services such as Apple Music, Bloomberg reported . Among the notable changes that are expected to be revealed, Apple is transitioning the iPhone's charging and data port to the USB-C standard, enhancing its performance albeit potentially displeasing some consumers. The modification marks the second alteration to the iPhone's port since its inception, the previous one being in 2012. The iPhone 15 series will reportedly come in four different versions: the base models iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, and the more premium iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. The Pro versions, specifically, have undergone a design overhaul, adopting titanium sides instead of stainless steel, making them more resilient and lighter. Also Read: Apple's $3 Trillion Crown Slips As Disappointing Sales Take Toll Another significant enhancement is the incorporation of the Dynamic Island interface in the non-Pro models, a feature introduced in the iPhone 14 Pro models last year, according to Bloomberg. The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are reportedly upgrading to a 48-megapixel main camera sensor, aligning with the resolution of the previous year's iPhone 14 Pro's main camera. The Pro models will also retain a trio of cameras, boasting new telephoto and ultrawide lenses with increased megapixels. The iPhone 15 Pro Max, on the other hand, will have a revamped telephoto system that doubles the hardware zoom capabilities from 3X to approximately 6X magnification. On the Apple Watch front, the focus remains on enhancing performance, with significant strides made in processing speed facilitated by a new chip. The watches will also reportedly inherit the U2 ultrawide-band chip, promising improved \"Find My\" functionalities. As for the AirPods, the shift to USB-C charging aligns with the changes introduced in the iPhone series. While no substantial hardware alterations are expected, a software update promises features like improved automatic device switching and a Conversation Awareness feature that intuitively silences media when a conversation is initiated, according to Bloomberg.

        "content": "A new Utah Foundation report affirms the more postsecondary education a person has, there\u2019s a better return on investment. But the report, titled \u201cBang for your buck: Which Utah schools have the best return on investment,\u201d also indicates much depends on what a student studies and the workforce demand for those credentials. The report, which examined return on investment at Utah\u2019s public and private colleges and universities, found Weber State University is tops for students\u2019 10-year net present value of their education. This was calculated by how much a certain sum of money \u2014 in this case, the future earnings of additional education minus the cost of that education \u2014 would be worth today. The report shows that the first-year returns of graduates of some Weber State University associate degree programs \u2014 computer science, industrial production technologies, nursing and allied health professions \u2014 outstrip the median bachelor\u2019s degree programs. Graduates of Weber State\u2019s manufacturing engineering technology associate degree program \u2014 its plastics and composites concentration, for one \u2014 experience first-year median returns of nearly $69,000, according to the report. The median return on investment for those who earn associate degrees in computer science from Weber State is $58,224 and $48,672 for nursing. Nursing students Kalley Jaques and Aisha Holts work on a central line change as students work in the simulation lab in the Marriott Health Building at Weber State University in Ogden on Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2023. Scott G Winterton, Deseret News \u201cBachelor\u2019s degrees in Utah are more likely to pay off in the longer run \u2014 though Weber State University defies this trend. The most common credential from Weber State University is an associate\u2019s degree, though they also offer certifications and bachelor\u2019s degrees,\u201d the report states. The university also offers a wide array of graduate degree programs, including a doctorate of nursing practice and a physician assistant program. Weber State University Provost Ravi Krovi said the report was welcome news to administrators and educators striving to offer programs that meet workforce needs and help graduates earn higher wages. \u201cWe were thrilled but we\u2019re not altogether surprised. It\u2019s sort of validating, quite honestly. We certainly want to tell our story but when you have data which comes in and proves it, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s even better,\u201d he said. Krovi said Weber State University has made \u201ca conscious attempt to really focus on cost from a tuition and fees perspective. Our tuition and fees have not gone up that much. If you go back to the last 10 years, it\u2019s less than the overall increase in the consumer price index.\u201d The university has made guided pathways a priority, too, he said. \u201cAs students come in, we try to give them a better perspective of what are the options and so I think it\u2019s one thing to give advice, but it\u2019s also important to have the right type of programming. Stackable programs really help us from that standpoint,\u201d he said. A student might come to Weber State with the goal of earning a certificate, which are short-term programs. Once they grow accustomed to the college experience, the hope is they will feel more comfortable and confident about seeking an associate degree or even a bachelor\u2019s degree, he said. \u201cThat transition and transfer is a lot more seamless because it\u2019s all our curriculum, our program. So I think that mission, the dual mission for us, is really helpful for students,\u201d Krovi said. Nursing student Whitney Weston works out a few mathematical problems as she and other students go about their work in the simulation lab in the Marriott Health Building at Weber State University in Ogden on Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2023. Scott G Winterton, Deseret News The report also notes Salt Lake Community College\u2019s large variety of associate degrees. Its computer and information sciences program, for example, \u201chas a first-year return on investment of a whopping $53,628,\u201d the report states. Associate degrees with the highest median earnings include engineering and architecture. Median earnings are also higher than average for public safety, nursing, construction and manufacturing, business and agriculture degrees, according to the report. The report also found that the private, for-profit Neumont College of Computer Science had the highest ranked 40-year net present value of any college in Utah, followed by Brigham Young University, the University of Utah, Weber State and Westminster University. The report explores the financial return on investment for education beyond high school \u2014 or whether pursuing certificates, certification, associate degrees and bachelor\u2019s degrees make financial sense. \u201cResearch suggests that the return on investment for education beyond high school is generally worth the time and effort,\u201d the report states. But degree selection and workforce and industry needs can make a difference. According to the report, more than a quarter of those with associate degrees earn more than the median bachelor\u2019s degree wage and 35% of those with bachelor\u2019s degrees earn more than the median master\u2019s degree wage.

        "content": "BOSTON \u2014 Most major car manufacturers admit they may be selling your personal information \u2014 though they are vague on the buyers, a new study finds, and half say they would share it with the government or law enforcement without a court order. The proliferation of sensors in automobiles \u2014 from telematics to fully digitized control consoles \u2014 has made them prodigious data-collection hubs. But drivers are given little or no control over the personal data their vehicles collect, researchers for the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation said in their latest \u201cPrivacy Not Included\u201d survey. Security standards are also vague, a big concern given automakers\u2019 track record of susceptibility to hacking. \u201cCars seem to have really flown under the privacy radar and I\u2019m really hoping that we can help remedy that because they are truly awful,\u201d said Jen Caltrider, the study\u2019s research lead. \u201cCars have microphones and people have all kinds of sensitive conversations in them. Cars have cameras that face inward and outward.\u201d Unless they opt for a used, pre-digital model, car buyers \u201cjust don\u2019t have a lot of options,\u201d Caltrider said. Cars scored worst for privacy among more than a dozen product categories \u2014 including fitness trackers, reproductive-health apps, smart speakers and other connected home appliances \u2014 that Mozilla has studied since 2017. Not one of the 25 car brands whose privacy notices were reviewed \u2014 chosen for their popularity in Europe and North America \u2014 met the minimum privacy standards of Mozilla, which promotes open-source, public interest technologies and maintains the Firefox browser. By contrast, 37% of the mental health apps the nonprofit reviewed this year did. Nineteen automakers say they can sell your personal data, their notices reveal. Half will share your information with government or law enforcement in response to a \u201crequest\u201d \u2014 as opposed to requiring a court order. Only two \u2014 Renault and Dacia, which are not sold in North America \u2014 offer drivers the option to have their data deleted. The automakers are vague on disclosing to whom they are selling what they collect, though the researchers have little doubt it includes data brokers, marketers and dealers. Partners with installed products and services, including SiriusXM, Google Maps and Onstar, are also amassing data. \u201cIncreasingly, most cars are wiretaps on wheels,\u201d said Albert Fox Cahn, a technology and human rights fellow at Harvard's Carr Center for Human Rights Policy. \u201cThe electronics that drivers pay more and more money to install are collecting more and more data on them and their passengers.\" \u201cThere is something uniquely invasive about transforming the privacy of one\u2019s car into a corporate surveillance space,\u201d he added. A trade group representing the makers of most cars and light trucks sold in the U.S., the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, took issue with that characterization. In a letter sent Tuesday to U.S. House and Senate leadership, it said it shares \u201cthe goal of protecting the privacy of consumers.\u201d It called for a federal privacy law, saying a \u201cpatchwork of state privacy laws creates confusion among consumers about their privacy rights and makes compliance unnecessarily difficult.\u201d The absence of such a law lets connected devices and smartphones amass data for tailored ad targeting and other marketing \u2014 while also raising the odds of massive information theft through cybersecurity breaches. The Associated Press asked the Alliance, which has resisted efforts to provide car owners and independent repair shops with access to onboard data, if it supports allowing car buyers to automatically opt out of data collection \u2014 and granting them the option of having collected data deleted. Spokesman Brian Weiss said that for safety reasons the group \u201chas concerns\u201d about letting customers completely opt out \u2014 but does endorse giving them greater control over how the data is used in marketing and by third parties. In a 2020 Pew Research survey, 52% of Americans said they had opted against using a product or service because they were worried about the amount of personal information it would collect about them. On security, Mozilla's minimum standards include encrypting all personal information on a car. The researchers said most car brands ignored their emailed questions on the matter, those that did offering partial, unsatisfactory responses. Japan-based Nissan astounded researchers with the level of honesty and detailed breakdowns of data collection its privacy notice provides, a stark contrast with Big Tech companies such as Facebook or Google. \u201cSensitive personal information\u201d collected includes driver's license numbers, immigration status, race, sexual orientation and health diagnoses. Further, Nissan says it can share \u201cinferences\u201d drawn from the data to create profiles \"reflecting the consumer\u2019s preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes.\u201d It was among six car companies that said they could collect \u201cgenetic information\u201d or \u201cgenetic characteristics,\" the researchers found. Nissan also said it collected information on \u201csexual activity.\" It didn't explain how. The all-electric Tesla brand scored high on Mozilla\u2019s \u201ccreepiness\u201d index. If an owner opts out of data collection, Tesla\u2019s privacy notice says the company may not be able to notify drivers \u201cin real time\u201d of issues that could result in \u201creduced functionality, serious damage, or inoperability.\u201d",

        "content": "___ The IRS plans to crack down on 1,600 millionaires to collect millions of dollars in back taxes WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The IRS is launching an effort to crack down on 1,600 millionaires and 75 large business partnerships that owe hundreds of millions of dollars in past due taxes. IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel says that with a boost in federal funding and the help of artificial intelligence tools, the agency has new means of targeting rich people who\u2019ve \u201ccut corners\u201d on their taxes. The IRS announced the effort on Friday. The IRS is trying to showcase positive results from its burst of new funding under President Joe Biden\u2019s Democratic administration. Republicans in Congress are looking to claw back some of that money. ___ Stock market today: Wall Street closes its worst week in the last 3 with a quiet finish NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Stocks drifted to a slightly higher close on Wall Street but still closed out their first losing week in the last three. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% Friday following three straight days of declines. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 75 points, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.1%. Treasury yields held relatively steady, helping to keep trading quiet. Strong reports on the economy earlier in the week sent yields higher and raised worries the Federal Reserve may keep interest rates higher for longer. High rates can slow inflation, but they hurt investment prices. ___ Germany will keep Russian oil giant Rosneft subsidiaries under its control for another 6 months BERLIN (AP) \u2014 The German government says it will keep two subsidiaries of Russian oil giant Rosneft under the control of German authorities for another six months. The government announced a year ago that it was putting the units under the administration of Germany\u2019s Federal Network Agency. In March, a German federal court threw out complaints from Rosneft and upheld the decision. The trusteeship gave German authorities control of three Russian-owned refineries. Rosneft accounted at the time for about 12% of Germany\u2019s oil refining capacity. The Economy Ministry said Friday that it is extending the trusteeship again until March 10 next year \u201cto secure the energy supply.\u201d ___ Update your iPhone: Apple just pushed out a significant security update Apple released a significant security update for iPhones and iPads Thursday to patch newly discovered security vulnerabilities in the devices\u2019 system software. The issue was discovered by researchers at the University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab, who said the software flaw was being \u201cactively exploited\u201d to deliver commercial spyware called Pegasus developed and sold by the Israeli company NSO Group. Pegasus is an expensive tool typically used to target dissidents, journalists and political opponents, so ordinary users likely have little to fear. Still, Citizen Lab recommends that all users should immediately update their devices. ___ Puerto Rico\u2019s public schools clamor for air conditioning to get relief from record-breaking heat SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) \u2014 Students and teachers are sweltering in public schools across Puerto Rico and demanding that the government install air conditioners as the U.S. Caribbean territory bakes under record heat this year. But the island\u2019s governor quietly vetoed a bill last month that would authorize the installation of cooling systems in a move that outraged many. The island\u2019s Department of Education has taken steps including allowing students to wear Bermuda shorts as it considers modifying schedules to cooler hours. The measures have appeased few as heat advisories for the island become the norm as Puerto Rico\u2019s government struggles to respond to the effects of climate change. ___ Kroger agrees to pay up to $1.4 billion to settle opioid lawsuits The Kroger Co. has agreed to pay up to $1.4 billion to settle lawsuits over the toll of opioids. The supermarket chain announced the plan on Friday. State and local governments would get the bulk of the money, though pieces are carved out for Native American tribes and to pay lawyers\u2019 costs. Most of the money is to be used to fight the addiction and overdose crisis. Drugmakers, distribution companies and other pharmacies have previously agreed to similar settlements totaling more than $50 billion. Remaining defendants include some generic manufacturers and regional wholesalers and pharmacies, along with pharmacy benefit companies. ___ The Biden administration wants more money and technology to prevent close calls between planes The Biden administration is putting more money into aviation safety and taking the first steps toward requiring that all planes be equipped with technology designed to prevent close calls around airports. The White House said Friday it\u2019s investing $26 million in things like more use of technology for tracking planes on the ground at airports. And the Federal Aviation Administration is asking one of its advisory panels to suggest how the government can require technology to warn pilots, for example, when they are lined up to land on the wrong runway. The moves are designed to counter an increase in close calls this year. ___ Annie Lennox plans to fundraise and entertain at Rotary event in Italy. She does not plan to retire NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Annie Lennox is not retiring. Though her partner in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band Eurythmics Dave Stewart recently posted that Lennox \u201cwon\u2019t be touring anymore\u201d and would not be part of the \u201cSweet Dreams 40th Anniversary Tour\u201d this fall, Lennox told The Associated Press that she will continue to perform. \u201cI\u2019m not retiring from anything,\u201d Lennox said. \u201cI\u2019m just stepping back because I spent decades on the road.\u201d Instead, Lennox plans on performing at more events like \u201cTime for Change,\u201d a fundraiser for numerous nonprofits, including Rotary International\u2019s End Polio Now initiative. Lennox will perform on the floor of the Colosseum on Sunday as part of the benefit. ___ The S&P 500 rose 6.35 points, or 0.1%, to 4,457.49. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 75.86 points, or 0.2%, to 34,576.59. The Nasdaq composite rose 12.69 points, or 0.1%, to 13,761.53. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.21 points, or 0.2%, to 1,851.54. \ud83d\udcec Sign up for the Daily Brief Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.",

        "content": "Companies are working with carbon-accounting startups to achieve their sustainability goals. Startups such as Watershed and Carbon Analytics create tech platforms that collect emissions data. Businesses can then gauge their carbon footprint and find ways to reduce it.

When leadership at the retailer Everlane wanted to make the company more eco-conscious, they set their sights on a tech-driven solution. In 2021, the clothing brand teamed up with the carbon-accounting startup Watershed to track carbon emissions, mostly from Everlane's supply chain, using data collection. The partnership has helped Everlane minimize its air freight and transition some of its production sources from raw materials to recycled alternatives, including cashmere. The company has also reduced its product emissions by 22% \u2014 notable progress toward its goal of curtailing 55% of product emissions by 2030. Katina Boutis, Everlane's director of sustainability, told Insider that Watershed's services give a more accurate, personalized read on the brand's carbon footprint. \"It's a tech-enabled platform rather than a static Excel file,\" she told Insider. \"You're not just estimating on global averages or on some type of monetary spend data that, in the end, may not be representative of your true impacts.\" Everlane is one of several companies using carbon-accounting startups to track emissions and put a dollar amount on their carbon footprints. Accounting climate tech allows companies to automate data collection on emissions from their operations. As the company uploads its financial stats, the software shows how the company's growth projections will go hand in hand with its climate impact and reduction goals. Carbon-offsetting efforts have been made in different industries, but many are nearly impossible to track, making them practically useless . But new startups are turning that around and making it a real part of reducing the effects of industrial carbon on the planet. An explosion in investor interest The carbon-accounting software global market is expected to jump from $15.3 billion in 2023 to $64.4 billion by 2030, Fortune Business Insights reported. Maria Fujihara, the founder and CEO of the decarbonization software provider Sinai Technologies , said companies are keen to understand the cost of their sustainability goals. The startup works with high-pollution sectors such as mining, agriculture, and manufacturing, helping them calculate internal carbon pricing by connecting companies' costs, spending, and savings with their decarbonization scenarios and recommending mitigation measures. Its clients include Bayer and Siemens. Maria Fujihara, the founder and CEO of Sinai Technologies. SINAI Technologies Now that companies have their sustainability teams, they want tools to do this kind of data collection and analysis independently instead of relying on consultants, Fujihara said. The investor demand for this climate tech has never been hotter. Investment by venture-capital firms in carbon-accounting startups surged from $60 million in 2020 to $767 million in 2022 , according to PitchBook . The trend hasn't slowed down, and $333 million has been invested so far this year. \"When I started, no investor would understand my idea,\" Fujihara said. \"Now, everyone wants to talk about it.\" The startup has raised $37 million since it was founded in 2017. Watershed, another startup, has backers including the venture-capital firm Sequoia. The company has raised $84 million since it was founded in 2019. In 2022, it was valued at $1 billion, with clients including BlackRock, Airbnb, and Walmart. \"We're approaching this tipping point where every single company will be adopting some kind of climate plan,\" said Amelia Penniman, a spokesperson for Watershed. Unlocking new climate solutions The carbon-accounting market lives by one mantra: You can't manage what you can't measure. Alissa Benchimol, the senior program officer at the Greenhouse Gas Management Institute , said that the startups' calculation method often begins by loading the software with external data on unit-conversion factors or emission factors and their potential impact on the climate. This information is usually found on open databases of national agencies such as the US Environmental Protection Agency and international databases like the International Energy Agency . Startups including Sinai, Carbon Analytics, and Watershed base their accounting on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a global standard that provides a framework for measuring the emissions of corporations, cities, and other sectors. Alissa Benchimol, the senior program officer at the Greenhouse Gas Management Institute. Courtesy of Alissa Benchimol Functionalities are added to the software to create the company \"profile\" by \"documenting their operation processes, identifying unique emission sources, and enabling year-to-year data storage and calculations,\" Benchimol said. Watershed software, for example, calculates a company's carbon footprint based on financial data that's uploaded to the platform. The data includes all operating costs, including, for example, employees' flights. The miles flown and the money spent are loaded into the system, which then comes up with the emission figures. The startups are helping companies track the three scope emissions : scope 1, which covers emissions from sources that a company owns or controls directly; scope 2, which are emissions from purchased energy that a company indirectly causes; and scope 3, which are all other indirect emissions that occur across the value chain and are outside of a business's control, such as how much electricity a supplier uses or the carbon footprint of delivering the products to consumers. But it's challenging to precisely monitor this since companies' emissions are not the same, and they often overlap. But companies will soon have no choice in reporting their carbon emissions. Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission released a proposal that would require publicly traded companies to disclose all their emission scopes, including scope 3, the most difficult to track. While many companies are sharing this data already, not all of them have been inspired to take action. In 2022, nearly 20,000 organizations voluntarily released their environmental information through CDP , a nonprofit that has run a global disclosure system for carbon emissions for over two decades. The number represents over 80% of FTSE 100 and S&P 500 index companies . \"A lot of companies actually do know what their emissions look like,\" said Lauren Gifford, the associate director of the Soil Carbon Solutions Center at Colorado State University , who studies carbon markets, climate finance, and climate tech. Gifford said most of the startups are taking the labor off companies to track their emissions, \"but having the capacity to respond to that is another conversation.\" The promise of data-driven sustainability Carbon-accounting startups say that tracking is just the first of several steps. Once the company has its data, it needs to implement changes, and that's where technology plays a crucial role. Watershed uses the data it collects to recommend decarbonization solutions, such as clean energy and carbon-removal projects, to companies. Case in point: It's helping DoorDash develop pilot programs, including an initiative to use electric vehicles to reduce emissions from its deliveries. The software also creates disclosure reports, which require the company to answer a series of questions that will be used to score its environmental progress. These reports can then be shared with CDP. Watershed can provide a breakdown of a company's yearly carbon emissions. Watershed The Sinai platform also suggests solutions based on a process of carbon pricing. Its software extrapolates a scenario where the company doesn't take steps to reduce its emissions and a second scenario where it does make changes, and then recommends mitigation measures and associated costs. \"The software allows companies to collect data with more frequency and not only at the end of the year to write a report,\" Fujihara said. \"That gives them more action power.\" Most of the companies, however, are still in the early stages of tracking and measuring emissions or just getting started on implementing changes. Michael Thornton, the founder and CEO of Carbon Analytics, said clients are starting to implement solutions including using renewable energy sources like solar panels and heat pumps. The startup works with small, midsize, and enterprise companies, including Virgin Atlantic. The carbon-accounting startups are expanding their services to offer more than tracking when it comes to helping companies reduce their carbon footprints. Watershed, for example, recently bought the emissions accounting and data firm VitalMetrics to expand its database. Others like Carbon Analytics are seeking partners to connect clients to decarbonization projects. \"The industry is still sort of new,\" Thornton said. \"The powerful thing is that markets and businesses are very good at reducing costs, optimizing, and making things more efficient once they have the data.\"",

        "content": "September 8, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked reputable news agency proofread by Mackenzie Hawkins, Bloomberg News The U.S. government has begun an official probe into an advanced made-in-China chip housed within Huawei Technologies Co.'s latest smartphone, as tensions flare between the two superpowers over technological prowess. The Commerce Department, which enacted a series of restrictions against Huawei and China's chip industry over the past two years, said it's working to get more information on a \"purported\" 7-nanometer processor discovered within the Mate 60 Pro. The chip was made by China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., which like Huawei is blacklisted by the U.S. and restricted from accessing American technology. The discovery of the chip set off a debate in Washington about the efficacy of sanctions intended to contain a geopolitical rival and coincided with a move in China to expand a ban on the use of iPhones in government-backed agencies and state companies. The U.S. has been trying to throttle China's tech sector for years amid concerns in Washington that it will gain a military edge. China, which has bristled at the restrictions, has its own fears about the use of foreign technology in sensitive industries and has been seeking to reduce its reliance on American software and circuitry. Clamping down on the iPhone threatens to erode Apple Inc.'s position in a market that yields about a fifth of its revenue and where it produces the majority of its star product. Apple has lost about $200 billion of market value in the past two days, adding to a litany of concerns over China weighing on major U.S. indexes. The shares were little changed in premarket trading in New York on Friday. Huawei's quiet reveal of a mobile phone utilizing technology the U.S. has sought to keep out of Beijing's hands threatens to derail recent efforts of outreach by the Biden administration. The Huawei phone went on sale online while Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was on a trip to China last week, the latest in a series of high-level diplomatic visits to Beijing. The debate now centers around whether it represents a failure of U.S. efforts\u2014led by Raimondo's department\u2014and has raised questions about whether the main U.S. mechanisms to rein in China, including controls on exports of key materials, tools and knowhow, need to be tightened. \"We are working to obtain more information on the character and composition of the purported 7nm chip,\" a Commerce spokesperson said in a statement. \"Let's be clear: export controls are just one tool in the U.S. government's toolbox to address the national security threats presented by the PRC. The restrictions in place since 2019 have knocked Huawei down and forced it to reinvent itself\u2014at a substantial cost to the PRC government.\" Chinese semiconductor equipment makers soared as much as 20% after news of the U.S. probe spurred bets that the sector will enjoy increased state support. That advance was mostly led by companies related to lithography gear\u2014a weak link in China's chip supply chain and one Beijing is keen to develop. Shanghai Electric Group Co., whose controlling shareholder has a major stake in lithography specialist Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment Group Co., rose by its 10% limit. \"We have always opposed politicizing trade and technology issues and overstretching and abusing the concept of national security,\" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters at a regular briefing in Beijing Friday. \"Sanctions will not stop China's development, it will only strengthen China's resolve and capability to seek self-reliance and technology innovation.\" The Mate 60 Pro smartphone employs an unusually high proportion of Chinese parts, in addition to its main processor, an ongoing teardown by TechInsights conducted for Bloomberg News revealed, a sign of the country's progress in developing domestic tech capabilities. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has said he would withhold comment until the U.S. gets more information. \"There's a number of different methods to try to sort of come to an understanding of what exactly it is that we're dealing with here,\" Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday. \"I can't give you an exact number of days but this is not going to be months down the road. We're going to want to look at this carefully, consult with our partners, get a clearer sense of what we're looking at, and then we'll make decisions accordingly. \" In the meantime, Huawei's new devices have spurred an outpouring of nationalist sentiment on Chinese social media, which portrayed them as a triumph in the face of U.S. sanctions. On Friday, Huawei debuted an even more powerful smartphone\u2014the Mate 60 Pro+\u2014in an online video teaser. The Pro+ adds a 1-terabyte maximum storage option and 4GB more memory than on the Pro model, which retails at 6,999 yuan. Shares of Huawei suppliers soared as much as their 10% daily limit on Chinese exchanges after that latest offering hit online stores. 2023 Bloomberg L.P. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

        "content": "Stocks that offer shareholders great dividends are pretty rare. While it is true that about three-quarters (75%) of companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index pay a dividend, the average yield is only 1.54%. Few companies raise their dividend payments consistently, and dividends may get cut when times get tough. Right now, only 67 stocks in the S&P 500 are \u201c dividend aristocrats .\u201d These are stocks of companies that have raised their dividend payments for 25 consecutive years or longer. This is a select group of best-of-breed dividend growth stocks , most of which have a long track record of outperforming the broader market. For investors chasing yield or who prize the income they get from their investments, dividend aristocrats are where you want to allocate capital. Here are the three best dividend stocks to buy now. J.M. Smucker Co. (SJM) Bets known for its jams, peanut butter and maple syrup, J.M. Smucker Co. (NYSE: SJM ) is officially a dividend aristocrat. In business since 1897, the company has now raised its dividend for 26 consecutive years, making it one of the newer dividend aristocrats in the S&P 500 index. Earlier this year, CNBC host Jim Cramer singled J.M. Smucker out for its dividend , saying: \u201cThis is just a good, solid business that deserves to be considered in the top tier of packaged-foods companies. I don\u2019t think it gets the respect that it deserves.\u201d J.M. Smucker is a company that is always growing and diversifying, often through acquisitions. Over the last decade, J.M. Smucker has expanded into pet food, adding Milk Bones and 9Lives to its portfolio of brands. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.06 per share, which gives it a yield of 3%. That\u2019s well above the average among companies trading in the S&P 500. SJM stock has declined 11% this year on mixed earnings, setting up a potential buying opportunity for investors. Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) Tool maker Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE: SWK ) is more than a dividend aristocrat. The maker of drills and saws is a dividend king, one of the few publicly traded companies that has raised its dividend payment to stockholders for more than 50 years. In business since 1842, Stanley Black & Decker has increased its dividend for 55 consecutive years. That is an extremely impressive feat. Today, SWK stock offers shareholders a quarterly dividend payment of 81 cents a share, giving it a yield of 3.50%. With annual sales of $15 billion, Stanley Black & Decker is today one of the world\u2019s largest industrial product manufacturers. While the company\u2019s sales can be cyclical and trend up or down with the economy , its strong brand and popularity with contractors help to see it through most economic downturns. This year, SWK stock has been on an upswing, having increased by roughly 20% since January. The company and stock have gotten a lift coming out of the 2022 bear market. This is one of the best dividend stocks around. Colgate-Palmolive (CL) Consumer products company Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL ) is another dividend king. Astonishingly, the company behind Colgate toothpaste, Speed Stick deodorant, and Irish Spring soap has paid its stockholders uninterrupted dividends since 1895. The company has also increased its dividend payout for 60 consecutive years. Today, CL stock pays a quarterly dividend of 48 cents a share, which gives it a yield of 2.60%. Few stocks can match this company\u2019s commitment to its dividend and rewarding shareholders. With roots dating back to 1806, Colgate-Palmolive is one of the oldest companies and stocks in the U.S. Like the other names on this list, Colgate-Palmolive is a diversified company with sales in more than 200 countries. However, half of the company\u2019s annual revenue of about $18 billion still comes from its signature toothpaste and other oral care products. More recently, Colgate-Palmolive has been focusing its growth on emerging markets. CL stock has slipped 7% lower this year and looks attractively valued at current levels. Its ongoing dividend increases only strengthen the investment\u2019s appeal.

        "content": "By: Kendall Cooper | Published: September 8, 2023 Newswise \u2014 A Florida State University researcher will investigate efficient strategies to chemically synthesize some of nature\u2019s most complex molecular structures thanks to a grant from the National Institutes of Health. Joel M. Smith, an assistant professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry, received the Maximizing Investigators\u2019 Research Award, or MIRA, from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences to study the potential that synthesizing small, complex molecules could have on the biomedical and pharmaceutical industries. He will use the five-year, $1.8 million grant to investigate two primary areas \u2014 small, psychedelic molecules\u2019 potential as treatment for various neurological diseases and complex, organic marine matter\u2019s potential to provide key insights for fundamental pharmaceutical discovery. \u201cEarning this grant means that the scientific community still values the power of complex molecule synthesis and its role in making biomedical advancements,\u201d Smith said. \u201cMany critics claim that natural product synthesis is directionless and far too arduous. We embrace that criticism as a challenge to improve our craft.\u201d Psychedelic molecules have undergone a renaissance recently, as researchers have reinvigorated investigations into their effectiveness in treating various neurological disorders, some of which include migraines, severe depression, PTSD and Parkinson\u2019s disease. Much of Smith\u2019s research centers on chemical derivatives of psychedelics, novel molecules that resemble the parent psychedelic but contain small differences that hone their biological specificity and efficacy. Derivatives of structurally simple psychedelics like N,N-dimethyltryptamine (also known as DMT and the psychoactive chemical in ayahuasca) and psilocin (the psychoactive chemical in \u201cmagic mushrooms\u201d) have seen rapid medical advancement in recent years, but the development of derivatives of lysergic acid diethylamide, also known as LSD, has lagged due to its structural complexity. Smith and his lab members aim to synthesize LSD derivatives to interrogate how a variety of slightly altered structural modification affect the substance\u2019s psychedelic activity, metabolic stability, and efficacy as leads for neuropsychiatric treatment. \u201cIt is anticipated that new LSD derivatives will pave a new direction in psychedelic science and will lay the groundwork for the discovery of psychedelic derivatives that have an unparalleled neurotherapeutic index, or range of doses at which a medication is effective without unacceptable adverse effects,\u201d Smith said. The chemical synthesis necessary to create these new molecules is made possible by a unique synthetic platform developed by the Smith Lab , which allows for the rapid generation of derivatives never previously synthesized. \u201cDr. Smith earning this NIH MIRA grant strengthens the department\u2019s confidence and determination for the further development of areas at the intersection of chemistry and health,\u201d said Wei Yang, chair of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. \u201cIt is synergic with the university\u2019s vision for the significant enhancement of its biomedical and translational research portfolio.\u201d Smith\u2019s second aim for the study is to create chemical derivatives of marine natural products that have been notoriously tricky to construct. Specifically, he is investigating manzamine alkaloids, which are structurally complex chemical metabolites that boast antimicrobial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity. A notable example of a manzamine alkaloid is manzamine A, a structurally daunting dimeric natural product with a uniquely intriguing structure. \u201cThe advancement of molecules with marine origin is typically stifled by their limited access,\u201d Smith said. \u201cNonetheless, some natural marine products have made it into the clinic due to heroic efforts by synthetic chemists.\u201d Smith\u2019s strategy for both research areas hinges on using feedstock heterocyclic starting materials called pyridines, a type of raw material that often serves as the initial basis for chemical manufacturing of value-added substances. These are unnatural compounds that typically require a chemical reaction to be accessed. A versatile set of chemical reactions improves the variety of molecules that can be accessed from simple, cheap and abundant feedstocks like pyridine. The precise chemical manipulation of these materials is a benchmark area of research in Smith\u2019s lab, and he anticipates that wider accessibility to these unique marine alkaloid structures will open doors to a greater understanding of their biological activity and properties, benefitting scientists, physicians and patients alike. \u201cMy lab is centrally focused on the advancement of biomedical research while also remaining committed to training the next generation of synthetic chemists,\u201d Smith said.These developing minds are destined to discover fundamental advances in chemistry while concurrently finding translational solutions to unsolved pharmaceutical conundrums.\u201d After earning a doctorate in organic chemistry as a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2015, Smith was selected as an Arnold O. Beckman Postdoctoral Fellow at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. Smith joined FSU\u2019s faculty in 2018 upon the completion of his postdoctoral research, and he teaches both graduate and undergraduate organic chemistry courses in addition to his research endeavors.

        "description": "Monday:ECB\u2019s Wunsch (hawk \u2013 non voter) remains in favour of raising interest rates again:Underlying inflation remains persistent, may need more rate hikes.I\u2019m inclined to say we maybe need to do a little bit more.The idea that we\u2019ll have to come to a pause at a certain point can\u2019t be excluded, but it\u2019s too early to talk about stopping hiking completely.The Switzerland Q2 GDP missed expectations as the monetary tightening is starting to bite more heavily:GDP Q2 0.0% vs. 0.1% expected and 0.3% prior. ECB\u2019s Lagarde (hawk \u2013 voter) is focused on the inflation expectations and keeping them in check:It is exactly when people are paying most attention that central banks should deliver their key communication to ensure that those expectations remain firmly anchored.It will be critical for central banks to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored while these relative price changes play out.Tuesday:Chinese Caixin Services PMI missed expectations by a big margin although remaining in expansion:Services PMI 51.8 vs. 53.6 expected and 54.1 prior.The RBA left the cash rate unchanged as expected at 4.10%: Inflation in Australia has passed its peak. But inflation is still too high and will remain so for some time yet.The Australian economy is experiencing a period of below-trend growth. Returning inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe remains the priority. There are significant uncertainties around the outlook.Services price inflation has been surprisingly persistent overseas and the same could occur in Australia.Some further tightening of monetary policy may be required.Will continue to pay close attention to developments in the global economy, trends in household spending, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market.ECB\u2019s Lane (dove \u2013 voter) didn\u2019t offer much in terms of forward guidance:August inflation data is welcome, but we need to see that continue.We do expect bumpiness in easing of energy, food inflation.Easing in services inflation helps limit narrative that tourism is keeping services inflation high.The Eurozone July PPI beat expectations, but the figures were still all negative:PPI M/M -0.5% vs. -0.6% expected and -0.4% prior.PPI Y/Y -7.6% vs. -7.6% expected and -3.4% prior. ECB\u2019s Schnabel (hawk \u2013 voter) touched on climate change and how it could bring downside tail risks:Climate change is an existential threat with large downside tail risks.Climate-related and environmental risks (C&E risks) are now an important focal point for supervisors.Climate change constitutes an existential threat, implying large downside tail risks.Dealing with financial risks is the core of prudential supervision. Physical climate risks tend to be correlated globally.The economic consequences of physical climate risks could be mitigated by closing the large climate insurance protection gap.In the EU, only a quarter of losses caused by climate-related catastrophes are insured.Fed\u2019s Waller (hawk \u2013 voter) changed his stance and he\u2019s now leaning towards a pause:I would say the risks to doing too much and too little are balanced.The data last week clearly showed the jobs market is starting to soften. Unemployment is about where it was a year ago, so change isn't that big.Recessions are often caused by shocks that come out of nowhere, but the data so far is pretty good (for a soft landing).I want to be very careful to say that 'we've done the job'.I want to see 'a couple months' of data.I don't think one more hike would send the economy into a recession.Data will drive whether the Fed hikes again.Recent data will allow the Fed to proceed carefully.We're starting to see the economy slow down.Treasury yields are about where they should be.The US economy is 'about 80% closed' so impacts from abroad will be smaller than for others.We've been keeping a very close eye on commercial real estate, will continue to roll over during the next 2 years or so.We're not sure about what prices CRE will be trading at in two years.Saudi Arabia announced that it would extend the voluntary 1 million barrels per day output cut through December and Russia quickly followed by saying it was cutting exports by 300k bpd through year end. Both added that caveat that the decision would be reviewed monthly. Fed\u2019s Mester (hawk \u2013 non voter) maintained her hawkish stance as she sees the need to go a \u201clittle bit\u201d higher on rates:The labour market has come more into balance.From what I see so far, we might have to go a bit higher, we might have to raise the policy rate a bit more.There is still a lot of time before our next decision in September and we will get a lot of data and information by then.Gasoline prices are rising again. We have to be very attentive to that.The longer inflation stays above 2%, the more likely it is that the risks will materialise.If we end up raising interest rates too much and the economy loses momentum more than necessary, we can lower interest rates.We will certainly not continue to raise interest rates until inflation has already fallen to 2%. Nor will we wait to lower interest rates until inflation is at 2%.There are upside risks to our inflation forecasts, in my view.Wednesday:The Australian Q2 GDP beat expectations:GDP Q2 0.4% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% prior.BoJ\u2019s Takata sounded optimistic on hitting the inflation target but remains wary of downside risks:Japan is seeing early signs of hitting 2% inflation.Japan's economy is recovering moderately.He believes that the Bank of Japan must patiently maintain easy monetary policy given the very high uncertainty on the outlook.At the same time, BOJ must respond nimbly to uncertainty with eye on economic, price outlook.There's a chance Japan will see shift in public perception prices and wages won't rise much.Japan seeing signs of change in corporate wage, price-setting behaviour.There is sign of change in Japan's trend inflation as rising wages push up inflation expectations.Inflation is already exceeding BOJ's 2% target but there is some distance to achieving it stably and in sustainable fashion.If overseas economies slow sharply, that could weigh on Japan's economy.Stronger than expected US economy having an impact on currencies.Overseas factors having greater impact on currencies.We need to stand ready to flexibly respond to uncertainty.Action in July was a flexible response.ECB\u2019s Villeroy (neutral \u2013 voter) is leaning more towards keeping interest rates high for longer rather than raising them more:There is a slowdown but no recession.Had first successes against inflation but need to persevere.Must bring inflation down to 2% level between now and 2025.We are near or very near the peak on interest rates.Our options are open at the next and upcoming rate meetings.Maintaining rates for a sufficiently long period now counts more than further rate hikes.ECB\u2019s Knot (hawk \u2013 voter) didn\u2019t sound much confident on a September rate hike:Markets may be underestimating September rate hike chances.Bringing inflation to 2% by the end of 2025 is the bare minimum.Rate hike is a possibility, not a certainty.The Eurozone July Retail Sales missed expectations on the M/M figure but beat on the Y/Y one:Retail Sales M/M -0.2% vs. -0.1% expected and 0.2% prior (revised from -0.3%).Retail Sales Y/Y -1.0% vs. -1.2% expected and -1.0% prior (revised from -1.0%).ECB\u2019s Kazimir (hawk \u2013 voter) favours one last rate hike:The preferable option would be to hike rates by 25 bps next week.One more, likely last rate hike, still needed.The alternative option would be to hike in October or December.Inflation remains stubbornly high, price growth expectations too far above 2%.Fed\u2019s Collins (neutral \u2013 non voter) is leaning towards a high for longer stance rather than a higher for longer one:It's time for monetary policy to be patient and deliberate.Fed should 'allow time' when making monetary policy choices.Too soon to say inflation sustainably moving back to target.Fed must balance lowering inflation against slowing economy too much.Fed can likely achieve goals without causing notable economic pain.Still too much job market demand.Wage growth remains elevated.Core services inflation moderation has been modest.Expects economy to slow into end of year.BoE\u2019s Bailey (neutral \u2013 voter) is expecting a \u201cmarked\u201d fall in inflation by year-end:Wage bargaining has surprised to the upside.There has been a very large terms of trade shock in this country.Many indicators are signalling a fall in inflation, which will be marked by the end of this year.Question is: As headline inflation comes down, will we see inflation expectations continue to come down and will that impact wage bargaining?There is not group think at the MPC at the moment.BoE\u2019s Dhingra (dove \u2013 voter) maintains her dovish stance as she expects the monetary policy lags to start affecting the economy more heavily:Labour market continues to ease as MPC's hiking cycle takes effect with a lag.Pass-through of level changes to wages would not necessarily pose a risk to our target in the medium term.Not yet evidence to suggest firms will seek to increase their margins.Domestic factors are likely to continue to ease the pressure on CPI inflation.The Bank of Canada kept interest rates steady at 5.00% as expected:The Canadian economy has entered a period of weaker growth. The tightness in the labour market has continued to ease gradually. Recent CPI data indicate that inflationary pressures remain broad-based. With the recent increase in gasoline prices, CPI inflation is expected to be higher in the near term before easing again. With recent evidence that excess demand in the economy is easing, and given the lagged effects of monetary policy, Governing Council decided to hold the policy interest rate at 5%.Governing Council remains concerned about the persistence of underlying inflationary pressures, and is prepared to increase the policy interest rate further if needed. Growth prospects in China have diminished. In the United States, growth was stronger than expected.The US ISM Services PMI beat expectations by a big margin coming at 54.5 vs. 52.5 expected and 52.7 prior:employment index 54.7 vs. 50.7 prior.new orders index 57.5 vs. 55.0 prior.prices paid index 58.9 vs. 56.8 prior.new export orders 62.1 vs. 61.1 prior.imports 52.3 vs. 52.3 prior.backlog of orders 41.8 vs. 52.1 prior.inventories 57.7 vs. 50.4 prior.supplier deliveries 48.5 vs. 48.1 prior.inventory sentiment 61.5 vs. 56.6 prior.The Fed release the Beige Book which provides recent anecdotal information on current economic conditions: Most Districts indicated economic growth was modest during July and August. Consumer spending on tourism was stronger than expected but other retail spending continued to slow, especially non-essential.Some Districts highlighted reports suggesting consumers may have exhausted their savings and are relying more on borrowing to support spending. New auto sales did expand in many Districts, but contacts noted this had more to do with better availability of inventory rather than increased consumer demand. Manufacturing contacts in several Districts also noted that supply chain delays improved. New orders were stable or declined in most Districts, and backlogs shortened. Nearly all Districts reported the inventory of homes for sale remained constrained.Some Districts reported higher delinquencies on consumer credit lines.Job growth was subdued across the nation. Nearly all Districts indicated businesses renewed their previously unfulfilled expectations that wage growth will slow broadly in the near term.Most Districts reported price growth slowed overall, decelerating faster in manufacturing and consumer-goods sectors.Thursday:BoJ Nakagawa thinks that it\u2019s appropriate to maintain easy monetary policy for now but there are signs that inflation is on path to achieve their target and the risk that it could even accelerate more than expected:Appropriate to maintain easy monetary policy for time being.Signs of change seen in Japan's corporate price, wage-setting behaviour.Still not at stage where we can say Japan has stably, sustainably achieved BOJ\u2019s price targetMonetary easing involves various side-effects.BOJ will conduct flexible market operation when 10-year JGB yield moves in range of 0.5-1.0% range with eye on interest rate levels and speed of moves.BOJ\u2019s July decision has heightened sustainability of its monetary easing framework.Japan's capex, consumption increasing moderately.Japan's economy likely to continue recovering moderately.Our baseline scenario is for consumer inflation to gradually re-accelerate after a period of slowdown.There is chance inflation could accelerate more than expected, though there is also chance pass-through of costs could moderate.Job market tightening but outlook for wages also depends on corporate earnings.Price rises for goods broadening, service prices also rising mainly for accommodation fees.Must be vigilant to risk of further slowdown in global growth.Sees equal degree of upside and downside risks to inflation.Can exit NIRP when economy is strong enough.But there is no preset idea on order or timing of that.It depends on financial developments at the time.Does not want to comment on FX levels.Strong outcome in next year's wage talks would be a necessary condition, though not a sufficient one to contemplate pursuing end of negative rates.Want to look at various factors beyond wages in deciding future policy changes.Further YCC tweak cannot be ruled out but is not an imminent issue now.The Chinese trade data beat expectations but the readings remain very poor:Exports Y/Y -8.8% vs. -9.2% expected and -14.5% prior. Imports Y/Y -7.3% vs. -9.0% expected and -12.4% prior. RBA\u2019s Lowe gave his final speech as Governor as Deputy Governor Bullock will take over as the new head on September 18:My recent focus is risk wages, profits run ahead of rates consistent with return to inflation target.If this risk materialised and inflation became sticky, would require tighter monetary policy.Will be difficult to return to the earlier world in which inflation tracked in a very narrow range.Inflation is likely to be more variable around target.Australia has been well served by a flexible inflation target.Possible that Australia can sustain unemployment rates below what we have had over the past 40 years.Now in an environment of stronger growth in nominal wages, which is positive.The recent productivity record isn\u2019t encouraging; solution fundamentally a political problem.Interest rates influence housing prices but are not reason Australia has some of the highest prices in the world.Issue that defined my term more than any other was forward guidance on rates during the pandemic.Guidance was widely interpreted as a commitment, rather than a conditional statement.With the benefit of hindsight, my view is that we did do too much during pandemic.The Switzerland August seasonally adjusted Unemployment Rate remained steady at 2.1% vs. 2.1% expected and 2.1% prior. The Eurozone Q2 Final GDP reading was 0.1% vs. 0.3% expected as the previous estimate was revised to 0.1%:Household consumption flat.Government expenditure 0.1%.Gross fixed capital formation 0.1%.External balance -0.4%.Changes in inventories 0.4%.The US Jobless Claims beat expectations by a big margin across the board: Initial Claims 216K vs. 234K expected and 228K prior. Continuing Claims 1679K vs. 1715K expected and 1725K prior. The BoC Governor Macklem delivered a hawkish speech titled \"staying the course\u201d:We are concerned that progress in bringing down inflation has slowed.We are prepared to raise rates again but don't want to raise rates than we have to.The longer we wait, the harder it is likely to be to reduce inflation.Monetary policy might not be restrictive enough to restore price stability.Bank is concerned that larger-than-normal price increases for goods and services remain broad based.We are not trying to kill economic growth.The biggest contribution to the slowing in inflation since the peak last year has been from energy, which accounts for two-thirds of the slowdown.Today, about 60% of CPI components are rising above 3% and about 45% are rising above 5%.Looking ahead, we want to see less-generalized price increases as well as a decline in the average price increase.The weakness in second-quarter GDP largely reflected a broad-based slowing in consumer spending and a decline in housing activity.We will be watching wage growth closely.Maybe we don't need to do more, maybe we do on interest rates.We will take decisions meeting by meeting.Expecting growth of 'a little less than 1%' over the next few quarters.You can expect headline inflation is going to go up in the near term, before it eases.Fed\u2019s Williams (neutral \u2013 voter) just expressed the uncertainty policymakers are currently facing:Labor market balances are evening out.There's still more data to come before next FOMC meeting.Inflation is far too high but moving down.Policy is in a good place, is data dependent.We are seeing movement in the right direction for the economy.It's an open question if monetary policy is restrictive enough.The latest consumer spending data has been strong.Expects unemployment rate to rise to low 4% range.Fed\u2019s Goolsbee (dove \u2013 voter) maintains his stance as he prefers to keep rates high for longer rather than higher for longer:It's possible we can get on 'golden path'.Monetary policy is working.Overall level of inflation is above where we want it.Clearly there are risks.China, US government shutdown are among possible risks.We have also had false dawns on inflation before.Want to see progress on core inflation, especially goods and housing.Market's expectations on inflation also have a major influence.I'd pay less attention to wage growth as an indicator of inflation.We are very rapidly approaching time when are argument is not about how high should rates go, but rather how long rates have to stay high.Collectively Fed forecast is that rates will have to stay up for a relatively extended period.You can't change the inflation target until you've hit your inflation target.We have to get to the 2% inflation target, retain credibility.A possible UAW strike could have an impact, it could be material to our decisions.Fed\u2019s Logan (hawk \u2013 voter) called for a skip at the upcoming September FOMC meeting:'Could be appropriate' to skip interest-rate increase in September.There is 'work left to do' to get to sufficiently restrictive policy.Skipping does not imply stopping rate hikes.Not yet convinced we've extinguished excess inflation.Fed needs to calibrate policy 'carefully,' must proceed gradually.Significantly lower inflation in recent months 'encouraging,' but too soon to confidently say on path to 2% in timely way.Job market strength suggests we have not finished the job of restoring price stability.If stronger economic activity continues, could lead to a resurgence of inflation.Friday:Japan July Average Cash Earnings growth slowed down more, and the wages data is something the BoJ is particularly focused on:Average Cash Earnings Y/Y 1.3% vs. 2.3% prior. Real Wages Y/Y -2.5%.Household spending -5.00% vs. -4.2% prior.The Japanese Final Q2 GDP missed expectations and the previous reading was revised downwards:Japan Q2 GDP 1.2% vs. 1.3% expected and 0.8% prior (revised from 1.5%).GDP Growth Annualised 4.8% vs. 5.5% expected and 3.2% prior (revised from 6%).The Canadian Jobs report showed another pick up in wage growth which is something the BoC is particularly focused on:Employment change 39.9K vs. 20.0K expected and -6.4K prior.Full time 32.2K vs. 1.7K prior.Part time 7.8K vs. -8.1K prior.Participation rate 65.5% vs. 65.6% expected and 65.6% prior.Average hourly wages permanent employees 5.2% vs. 4.7% expected and 5.0% prior.Unemployment rate 5.5% vs. 5.6% expected and 5.5% prior.The highlights for next week will be:Tuesday: UK Labour Market report, German ZEW, US NFIB Small Business Optimism Index.Wednesday: Japan PPI, UK GDP, EZ Industrial Production, US CPI.Thursday: Australia Labour Market report, Japan Industrial Production, Switzerland PPI, ECB Policy Decision, US Jobless Claims, US PPI, US Retail Sales.Friday: NZ Manufacturing PMI, China Industrial Production and Retail Sales, Eurozone Wages data, US University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment.

        "content": "This is a published version of the Forbes Daily newsletter , you can sign-up to get Forbes Daily in your inbox here . Good morning, Some traditions persist. Nearly 8 in 10 women who marry men still adopt their husbands' last names, according to a new Pew Research Center survey . Changing one\u2019s name is rooted in the not-so-distant history when women had far fewer rights, and some states still required a woman to use her husband's name to vote or obtain a passport as recently as the 1970s. Those who keep their names often do so because they feel it is linked to their identity. It may soon become more common: Only one-third of single women said they planned to take their spouse\u2019s last name when they marry, Pew found. NFL star Joe Burrow has reportedly agreed to a record $275 million contract extension with the Cincinnati Bengals, making him the highest-paid player in the league\u2019s history. The reported deal, which follows months of negotiations, will see Burrow earn around $55 million a year, on average, and follows a series of record contracts signed by quarterbacks during the summer. Hurricane Lee strengthened to a Category 5 hurricane late Thursday, the National Hurricane Center said, and while it is expected to \u201cpass well to the north\u201d of major landmasses in the Western Atlantic, including the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, it is projected to cause \u201cdangerous beach conditions\u201d in the region. The NHC also warned of \u201cdangerous surf and rip currents\u201d affecting most of the U.S. East Coast starting Monday. The president of UAW, the union that represents 150,000 workers at General Motors, Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis, warned Thursday that a strike looks increasingly likely as the union struggles to make a deal with the automakers over hours worked, benefits and a requested 46% wage hike. The workers\u2019 contract expires on September 14, at which point leadership can call for a strike. Just 10 days of an auto workers strike could cost the U.S. economy $5 billion , according to consulting firm Anderson Economic Group. Ryan Salame, a former FTX executive, pleaded guilty Thursday to criminal charges related to the fraud case against Sam Bankman-Fried , the founder of the now-bankrupt company that was once one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. He\u2019s the fourth executive to plead guilty to criminal conduct since the company\u2019s collapse last fall. Apple and Nvidia, two of the tech stocks driving a majority of stock indexes\u2019 gains this year, suffered rare down stretches , losing over $250 billion in market capitalization this week. Shares of Nvidia, the S&P 500\u2019s best-performer in 2023, dropped about 3% Thursday, while Apple shares slipped 3.4%, fueled by concerns about each of their explosive sales. AI research lab Imbue has raised $200 million to build AI \u201cagents\u201d that can simulate human decision-making to complete complex tasks. The startup, one of very few woman-led AI unicorns, has a $1 billion valuation and access to 10,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, but its founders say it could be years away from revealing a product. Former Trump advisor Peter Navarro was found guilty on two counts of contempt of Congress Thursday, which is likely to send the Trump ally to prison after he declined to testify to the House Jan. 6 Committee. Navarro, who is expected to appeal the ruling against him, faces a sentence of between 30 days and one year in prison for each charge, as well as a maximum fine of $100,000. Canada is investigating whether China, Russia and other countries interfered in the country\u2019s recent elections, after a similar probe initiated by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier this year was cut short amid criticism by the Conservative Party. Trudeau has previously denied the possibility that Canada\u2019s elections had been interfered with , suggesting earlier this year that \u201cCanada has some of the best and most robust elections in the world.\u201d The NFL season kicked off Thursday night as the Detroit Lions upset reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs. Here\u2019s how to watch the games this fall , which will air across four television networks and two streaming services. Women soccer players in Spain are striking after failing to come to an agreement with the league on better pay as Spanish soccer continues to deal with the aftermath of its chief nonconsensually kissing a female player after the country\u2019s World Cup win. The biggest point of contention is pay: The minimum salary for men in the first division of La Liga is $197,000, the Associated Press reported, and for women it\u2019s $17,400. The Energy Department announced a $20 million fund Thursday to help companies and researchers find low-cost, sustainable ways to extract underground hydrogen and stimulate that natural process that creates the energy-rich element. It\u2019s part of a push to expand U.S. production of carbon-free energy to help fight climate change, and geologic hydrogen is particularly attractive because it would be the lowest-cost form of the fuel. Power system manufacturer FuelCell Energy and carmaker Toyota have deployed the world\u2019s first \u201ctri-gen\u201d system that turns methane-rich waste gas into electricity, clean hydrogen and water, and the companies said Thursday the facility is fully complete . Toyota\u2019s contract to use it runs for 20 years and should eliminate more than 9,000 tons of CO2 annually , the companies said, amid a broad push for greater use of hydrogen from sources that don\u2019t generate carbon dioxide. TOPLINE Critics say Apple has failed to develop a sustained, successful response to child exploitation materials on its services and fallen far behind competitors in helping police catch the criminals who proliferate it. A Forbes review of some 100 federal cases in which investigators searched Apple technologies, believing they were used in furtherance of child exploitation, found that the company\u2019s systems have been used to store and transmit thousands of items of CSAM, or child sexual abuse material, between 2014 and 2023. But unlike peers like Google and Meta, which proactively scan their services for such material and provide millions of leads every year to the nonprofit National Center For Missing And Exploited Children (NCMEC) and law enforcement, Apple reports just hundreds despite having hundreds of millions of iCloud users. Apple spent years working on a tool that would scour its servers for CSAM while maintaining customer privacy, dubbed NeuralHash. It was applauded by the child safety community but attacked by an even louder chorus of voices as a grave threat to privacy. At the end of 2022, Apple scrapped it, and key members of the team behind the project left the company. A\u200b\u200bpple has long maintained that privacy is a fundamental human right. The company famously refused to build for the FBI a backdoor into iOS that would circumvent several important security features and allow law enforcement to access personal data stored on iPhones. In a letter provided to Forbes , first reported by Wired , Erik Neuenschwander, Apple\u2019s director of user privacy and child safety, warned mass-scanning of Apple users would \u201c[open] the door for bulk surveillance.\u201d \u201cHow can users be assured that a tool for one type of surveillance has not been reconfigured to surveil for other content such as political activity or religious persecution?\u201d he wrote. \u201cTools of mass surveillance have widespread negative implications for freedom of speech and, by extension, democracy as a whole.\u201d Child safety advocates say that unwavering commitment to privacy comes at a cost: Apple is essentially blind to harmful, illegal material stored on its services. WHY IT MATTERS \u201cThe tug-o-war at play\u2014whether Apple can scan its tech for CSAM while also protecting users' privacy, and whether it should\u2014isn't new,\u201d says Forbes Senior Writer Alexandra Levine. \u201cBut leaders on privacy and encryption are now concluding that if Apple, having deployed enormous resources and engineering power over more than a decade, can't figure out how to do it, it simply can't be done. And looking ahead, children's online safety issues are only expected to intensify with the fast-growing AI boom.\u201d MORE TikTok Moderators Are Being Trained Using Graphic Images Of Child Sexual Abuse Gender-affirming care continues to be politicized, but a study published Thursday indicated hormone therapy could result in less depression, lower suicide risk and decreased gender dysphoria for transgender adults: 61%: The share of participants who had a \u201cclinically significant\u201d reduction in depression after receiving testosterone treatment 22: The number of states that have restricted or banned access to gender-affirming care 82%: The estimated share of transgender people who have considered suicide, according to a 2020 study The post-Labor Day hiring increase, dubbed the \u201cSeptember Surge\u201d on platforms like TikTok, is when some say companies ramp up hiring ahead of the holidays, though experts debate if it\u2019s real. Whether you believe it or not, if you\u2019re on the job hunt, take time to network and nurture those relationships , perfect your unique value proposition, refine your soft skills like critical thinking and ask those you know for help.

Yes, the \"One Chip Challenge\" Is Just as Dangerous as You've Heard We've seen TikTok challenges gone wrong before \u2014 you remember when social media users were boiling raw chicken in NyQuil, right? However, maybe none have been quite as controversial as the \"One Chip Challenge,\" which recently killed 14-year-old Harris Wolobah. While the product itself, a single chip made with Carolina Reaper and Naga Viper peppers, was quickly pulled from shelves following the reported death, Paqui has been selling the fire-hot tortilla chip packaged in a coffin-shaped container since 2016. And the product has still been spotted for sale on certain online retailers. This isn't the first time that the Paqui product has been linked to serious health concerns. According to Raj Dasgupta, MD, pulmonary specialist and chief medical advisor for Sleep Advisor, there has been a history of mouth and throat pain, nausea and vomiting, seizures, and now death. \"While the Paqui One Chip Challenge is intended for adults only, we have seen an increase in teen usage of the product. We care about all of our consumers and have made the decision to remove the product from shelves,\" a spokesperson for the brand said in a statement per NBC, adding that the company is \"deeply saddened by the death\" of Wolobah. \"We are actively working with our retailers and are offering refunds for any purchases of our single-serve one chip challenge product.\" Here's everything you\u2026 Megan Schaltegger",

        "description": "Upland hunters prefer to walk for their birds, often endlessly, rather than sit in a duck blind and await their prey to arrive. Boot leather, briar-proof pants and Bud Grant were made for the challenge.",
        "content": "Years ago when I lived in Ely and grouse season rolled around, as it will again Saturday the 16th, I regularly strolled into the woods toting a Model 12 Winchester. I had cut down this vintage smoke pole from its original 30 inches to a more swingworthy 28 and bored it for Briley chokes, screwing in the cylinder option for Ol' Ruff. The Winchester wasn't much of a grouse gun but it was the only gun I owned. Cased, it could slide behind the seat of my '56 Willys pickup, while my yellow Labrador, Boogie, rode sidekick. Dinner was what we brought home, if anything. Duck hunting is a good time, but the uplands and the many game birds they harbor \u2014 woodcock, pheasants, various species of quail, prairie chickens, sharp-tailed grouse and Hungarian partridge, in addition to my Ely quarry, ruffed grouse \u2014 often attract wing shooting specialists who want nothing to do with targeting mallards or other fowl. Exercise freaks by another name, upland hunters prefer to walk for their birds, often endlessly, rather than sit in a blind and await their prey to arrive over decoys. Already this early fall, sharptail seasons are open in North Dakota and Montana, and Minnesota nimrods eager to wear out boot leather are striding across western prairies, having the time of their lives putting birds in their hands. Or trying to. Among these is Jerry Kolter, who with his wife, Betsy, owns a Sandstone, Minn, setter and pointer training and breeding kennel. As you read this, Jerry's following an eager phalanx of his charges over hardscrabble flatlands, awaiting one of them to point and his other dogs to back \u2014 a visual rush that for centuries has inspired scattergunners and painters alike. Bud Grant was more of a duck hunter than an uplander, but he could cover country like Big Foot if there was a chance a covey of sharptails lay ahead. Years ago, Bud and I were in North Dakota, hightailing it through Bismarck, where at Bud's insistence we pulled over for ice cream. \"It's bad luck to drive by a Dairy Queen without stopping,'' Bud said. \"Words to live by,'' I said. Bud was running a black Lab named Maggie at the time and she could go all day working the willowy draws that pockmark the country on either side of the Missouri, near the North Dakota-South Dakota border. For my part, I put to ground a setter named Risky, and she and Maggie worked well together, one nearer, one farther out, angling into the wind or cutting it obliquely, eager to get a nose full of sharptail. This was later in autumn, after pheasant season had opened, and we were chasing these florid birds, too \u2014 ditch parrots as some roustabouts call them. By then in southwest North Dakota, the wheat stubble was colored goldenrod and the cottonwoods were shedding leaves. Each day, morning til sundown, we strode into this autumnal milieu, not killing many birds, but their scarcity hardly dampened our enthusiasm. In fact, the fewer the birds, the farther and faster we hiked, adopting like religion the uplander's credo, however fanciful, that just over the next rise, payoff awaits for sure , one sharptail after another, flying low and cackling. Though not the blaze-orange holiday it once was, in the years after I finished school in Morris, the day the pheasant season opened, and the day before and the day after, was in aggregate that university's real homecoming, no football required. A motel in that town, the Sunwood \u2014 now under a different name \u2014 was ringneck central over those long weekends in the '80s and into the '90s, and every manner of dog arrived there in every manner of pickup, their drivers guiding the rigs exuberantly. Like birds of a feather, uplanders share an affinity for a certain look afield, beginning with well-oiled boots and including briar-proof pants, a warm-but-not-too-warm blaze orange shirt or jacket, and ending with a similarly colored ball cap and vest whose rear pocket is big enough to carry felled birds. In Morris in those days, a few hundred of these similarly clad shotgunners would fan out posthaste from the Sunwood shortly after dawn on opening morning. Viewed from above, say as a red-tailed hawk could while catching the day's early thermals, this outpouring might recall a prison break, or perhaps a running start at Le Mans. Such eagerness, whose seasonal stirrings begin just now, in September, is nearly as old as time itself. As far back as the 1500s, Henry VIII waylaid grouse, woodcock and snipe in Britain with a crude form of shotgun that, while kicking like a mule, nevertheless toppled birds. Daniel Myron Lefever, an American, accelerated both upland sport and meal provisioning when in 1878 he invented the first hammerless shotgun, and by 1908, the Sears & Roebuck catalog featured an impressive 23 pages of shotguns for sale, including the New England Hammerless, retailing for $11.95 and manufactured in the Sears & Roebuck factory. So it is now, on the eve of the 2023 Minnesota ruffed (and sharp-tailed) grouse opener, and following it the woodcock and pheasant openers, that uplanders statewide are ripe for new beginnings. Some of these sporting types will chase birds in Minnesota only, hoping in coming months with the aid of their springer spaniels, wirehaired pointing Griffons, Pudelpointers, Gordon setters and other canines to still the echos of their yawning freezers \u2014 the better to pass the coming winter. Still other uplanders will consider the fall seasons here only a start, and in coming months will travel south to Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas, and then farther south still, to Texas and Arizona and even to Mexico, extending their days afield into next year, and hanging up their guns only then. Boot leather was made for this, also briar-proof pants and blaze orange shirts, jackets, caps and vests. And, I guess, Dairy Queens.",

(Sep)NOTE: Previews are listed in day orderNORWEGIAN CPI (MON): The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced.UK UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES (TUE): Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end.UK GDP ESTIMATE (WED): A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought.US CPI (WED): Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern.ECB ANNOUNCEMENT (THU): 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%.AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYMENT (THU): participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms.SWEDISH CPIF (THU): July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak.US RETAIL SALES (THU): Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July. While the data set will offer a glimpse on the health of the consumer amid concerns that the economy may slow significantly in the months ahead, traders will also be watching the University of Michigan's prelim survey release due Friday, where the rise in energy prices is likely to have weighed on sentiment.CHINESE ACTIVITY DATA (FRI): Retail sales Y/Y in August are expected to rise by 2.8% (prev. 2.5%), whilst there is currently no consensus for Industrial Production metrics. The data will be closely watched to diagnose the health of the world\u2019s second-larger economy and to gauge the drip-feed of stimulus seen over recent weeks. Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d.This article originally appeared on Newsquawk This article was written by Newsquawk Analysis at www.forexlive.com.",
        "content": ": The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced. : Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%.

        "content": "Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears alleges there is an influx of fentanyl-laced marijuana coming to Virginia and that the state\u2019s liberal cannabis policies are to blame. She\u2019s wrong on both counts. In a recent appearance on John Reid\u2019s Richmond Morning News podcast, , \u201cNow we have fentanyl coming through our borders and now that we in Virginia have legalized marijuana, you\u2019re getting fentanyl-laced marijuana. And, my God, it is killing us.\u201d In fact, there exist of fentanyl-laced cannabis in Virginia \u2014 or, for that matter, anywhere in the nation. In almost every instance where such cases have been alleged, these claims were after lab tests either the presence of the synthetic opioid or determined that the initial finding was the result of . Even representatives from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have acknowledged that there exists little support for the claim. In fact, a senior chemist for the agency that the DEA has never seized cannabis containing fentanyl. Furthermore, that fentanyl\u2019s active components quickly break down when heated, once it reaches the point of combustion. Consequently, it would be \u201cillogical and scientifically preposterous\u201d to purposefully mix fentanyl with cannabis, says toxicologist Ryan Marino, assistant professor of emergency medicine at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. \u201cThanks to the laws of chemistry, we know better.\u201d That said, the lieutenant governor is correct that cannabis products sold on the unregulated market can sometimes be of variable quality and purity. This is particularly true of so-called \u201chemp-derived\u201d cannabis products sold over the counter in Virginia. analyzing the contents of unregulated delta-8 vapor cartridges identified the presence of heavy metals, including magnesium, chromium, nickel and mercury, along with adulterants and other impurities. However, the solution to these public health concerns is not to call for a return to cannabis criminalization or to stoke sensationalist fears. Rather, Virginia lawmakers should take steps to mitigate consumers\u2019 risk of being exposed to potentially tainted products. In a legally regulated marketplace, cannabis products are made available from licensed manufacturers at retail stores. Cannabis is cultivated and products are manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practices. Products are lab tested and labeled accordingly \u2014 ensuring that consumers have access to products of verified purity and potency. The creation of such a regulated market was the intention of Virginia lawmakers and former Gov. Ralph Northam when in 2021 they legalized the possession and use of limited amounts of cannabis by adults. However, in the years since, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and his administration have made it clear that in taking steps to reign in and regulate the state\u2019s estimated . This head-in-the-sand position makes little sense. Nearly half of all states, including Maryland, have enacted legislation regulating the adult-use cannabis market. None of these states have repealed or even rolled back their legalization laws and public support for these policies has . According to the , legalizing marijuana is one of the few policy positions that a majority of Democrats, independents and Republican voters agree upon. That is because these policies are largely working as politicians and voters intended and they are preferable to prohibition. After a century of failed policies and canna-bigotry, Virginians are ready to move in a different direction \u2014 one that legalizes, regulates and educates. It is time for lawmakers to finish what they started and establish a regulatory framework that allows for the legal, licensed commercial production and retail sale of marijuana to adults.

        "content": "WORCESTER, Mass. \u2014 The death of a Massachusetts teenager after his family said he ate an extremely spicy tortilla chip has led to an outpouring of concern about the social media challenge and prompted retailers to pull the product from their shelves at the manufacturer\u2019s request. The family of Harris Wolobah held a vigil Friday, a week after his death on Sept. 1, to remember the basketball-loving 10th grader while they await the results of an autopsy to determine what killed him. Wolobah\u2019s family has blamed the One Chip Challege for the teen\u2019s death. The challenge calls for participants to eat an eponymously named chip and then see how long they can go without consuming other food and water. The family has declined interview requests. Police said they were called to the home on Sept. 1 and found Wolobah \u201cunresponsive and not breathing.\u201d He was transported to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The state medical examiner\u2019s office said it will likely take weeks before Wolobah\u2019s cause of death is determined. But the chip\u2019s manufacturer, Paqui, asked retailers to stop selling the product. People have been weighing in about their own experiences with the chip, which costs roughly $10 and comes individually wrapped in foil in a coffin-shaped box that warns, among other things, that it is made for the \u201cvengeful pleasure of intense heat and pain,\u201d is intended for adults and should be kept out of the reach of children. Despite the warning, children have had no problem buying the chips. A 10-year-old Florida girl was suspended this week for bringing one to school, her father, D\u2019Anton Patrick, told West Palm Beach television station WPTV. Six children at Forest Park Elementary School needed medical attention after coming into contact with the chip Wednesday, according to the suspension letter sent the girl\u2019s parents. Patrick said his 12-year-old son bought the chip at a Walgreens on Tuesday, but the boy\u2019s mother made him throw it away. He said his daughter, though, fished it out of the garbage and brought it to school. \u201cThe box says keep out of the hands of children. It says it\u2019s for adult consumption only. Why are y\u2019all selling it to a 12-year-old child?\u201d Patrick said. There have been reports from around the country of teens who have gotten sick after taking part in the challenge, including three students from a California high school who were sent to a hospital. Paramedics were called to a Minnesota school last year when seven students fell ill after taking part in the challenge. Friends of Wolobah said they heard about the chip challenge on social media and his death has convinced them it is more dangerous than they previously believed. \u201cI feel bad that his life ended short because of a social media challenge,\u201d said Marcus Kaba, 15, who remembered playing basketball with Harris. David Adjer, another teenager at the vigil who went to school with Harris, said he heard about Wolobah getting sick from the chip but found it hard to believe he died. \u201cPeople were telling me Harris passed away. I was just angry,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have this chip anymore. If someone dies from this chip, you should take out \u2026 They should take the chip off the shelves because we don\u2019t need any more accidents like this.\u201d Adults, too, have been testing their spice tolerance. Joaquin Diaz, a 31-year-old construction worker from the Bronx, in New York, said he tried the chip a few weeks ago after coming across social media videos about the challenge. He said he loves spicy food and wanted to see how he\u2019d stack up. Diaz told The Associated Press by phone Friday that the chip was very hot, but he didn\u2019t expect the stomach cramps and diarrhea that followed and led to him missing work the next day. \u201cIt hurt, I\u2019m not gonna lie. I was actually a little nervous,\u201d he said. Despite the stomach issues, Diaz said he had planned to try the chip again with some friends. But he decided not to after he heard about Wolobah\u2019s death. Roger Trier, a 56-year-old content creator and graphic designer from Palatine, Illinois, posted video on TikTok and YouTube of himself completing a 100-chip challenge this month. He told the AP that he has trained for over 20 years to build up his spice tolerance. \u201cMost people you see on social media \u2014 with any challenges \u2014 don\u2019t understand the consequences,\u201d he said. Trier said he thinks people under the age of 18 shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do spicy challenges without adult supervision because they might not know how to deal with the intense reactions the food can cause or the peer pressure that can push them to take risks they don\u2019t understand. Although the chip could still be bought in some stores as of Thursday, by Friday it had disappeared from the shelves of major retailers, including 7-Eleven and Walgreens. Amazon halted sales and was notifying customers who bought the product recently that Paqui was removing it. And eBay said it was blocking One Chip Challenge listings. Sales of the chip seem largely driven by people posting videos on social media of them or their friends taking the challenge. They show people, including children, unwrapping the packaging, eating the chips and then reacting to the heat. Some videos show people gagging, coughing and begging for water. Neither Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, Google, which owns YouTube, nor TikTok immediately replied to Friday requests for comment about whether they were taking any action. Paqui, a Texas-based subsidiary of The Hershey Company, said in a statement posted on its website Thursday that it was \u201cdeeply saddened by the death\u201d of Wolobah. \u201cWe have seen an increase in teens and other individuals not heeding these warnings,\u201d the company said. \u201cAs a result, while the product continues to adhere to food safety standards, out of abundance of caution, we are actively working with retailers to remove the product from shelves.\u201d At the vigil Friday, a crowd of about 100, including many of Wolobah\u2019s friends and teammates, turned out to a park in Worcester, down the hill from his home. They lit candles, swapped stories and ate pizza. Huge photos of the dread-locked teen hung from a statue, surrounded by his name in gold letters and blue and white balloons. Tiny basketballs were handed out. The most poignant moment came when Wolobah\u2019s mother, Lois, approached her son\u2019s photo, staring up at it, calling out his name several times and sobbing. She almost collapsed at one point and had to be held up by other family members as a relative addressed the crowd. \u201cI look around and see a community bond together by candlelight, by love and by the memory of our brother, of our son, of our nephew Harris,\u201d his cousin Valerie Richardson said. \u201cHarris had this gift for bringing people together. I can\u2019t think of a better way to honor him than what we are doing right here, right now.\u201d Massachusetts authorities posted a warning to parents about the challenge. And physicians cautioned that eating such spicy foods can have unintended consequences. \u201cYou can have very mild symptoms like burning or tingling of the lips in the mouth, but you can also have more severe symptoms,\u201d like significant abdominal pain or nausea and vomiting said Dr. Lauren Rice, the chief of pediatric emergency medicine at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. Dr. Peter Chai, an associate professor of emergency medicine and medical toxicology at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, said the chips can be dangerous under certain circumstances. \u201cIt\u2019s possible eating these chips with high concentration of capsaicin could cause death,\u201d Chai said, referring to the component of chili peppers that gives them their heat. \u201cIt would really depend on the amount of capsaicin that an individual was exposed to. At high doses, it can lead to fatal dysrhythmia or irreversible injury to the heart.\u201d",

        "content": "By STEVE LeBLANC and MICHAEL CASEY (Associated Press) WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) \u2014 The death of a Massachusetts teenager after his family said he ate an extremely spicy tortilla chip has led to an outpouring of concern about the social media challenge and prompted retailers to pull the product from their shelves at the manufacturer\u2019s request. The family of Harris Wolobah held a vigil Friday, a week after his death on Sept. 1, to remember the basketball-loving 10th grader while they await the results of an autopsy to determine what killed him. Wolobah\u2019s family has blamed the One Chip Challege for the teen\u2019s death. The challenge calls for participants to eat an eponymously named chip and then see how long they can go without consuming other food and water. The family has declined interview requests. Police said they were called to the home on Sept. 1 and found Wolobah \u201cunresponsive and not breathing.\u201d He was transported to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The state medical examiner\u2019s office said it will likely take weeks before Wolobah\u2019s cause of death is determined. But the chip\u2019s manufacturer, Paqui, asked retailers to stop selling the product. People have been weighing in about their own experiences with the chip, which costs roughly $10 and comes individually wrapped in foil in a coffin-shaped box that warns, among other things, that it is made for the \u201cvengeful pleasure of intense heat and pain,\u201d is intended for adults and should be kept out of the reach of children. Despite the warning, children have had no problem buying the chips. A 10-year-old Florida girl was suspended this week for bringing one to school, her father, D\u2019Anton Patrick, told West Palm Beach television station WPTV. Six children at Forest Park Elementary School needed medical attention after coming into contact with the chip Wednesday, according to the suspension letter sent the girl\u2019s parents. Patrick said his 12-year-old son bought the chip at a Walgreens on Tuesday, but the boy\u2019s mother made him throw it away. He said his daughter, though, fished it out of the garbage and brought it to school. \u201cThe box says keep out of the hands of children. It says it\u2019s for adult consumption only. Why are y\u2019all selling it to a 12-year-old child?\u201d Patrick said. There have been reports from around the country of teens who have gotten sick after taking part in the challenge, including three students from a California high school who were sent to a hospital. Paramedics were called to a Minnesota school last year when seven students fell ill after taking part in the challenge. Friends of Wolobah said they heard about the chip challenge on social media and his death has convinced them it is more dangerous than they previously believed. \u201cI feel bad that his life ended short because of a social media challenge,\u201d said Marcus Kaba, 15, who remembered playing basketball with Harris. David Adjer, another teenager at the vigil who went to school with Harris, said he heard about Wolobah getting sick from the chip but found it hard to believe he died. \u201cPeople were telling me Harris passed away. I was just angry,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have this chip anymore. If someone dies from this chip, you should take out \u2026 They should take the chip off the shelves because we don\u2019t need any more accidents like this.\u201d Adults, too, have been testing their spice tolerance.

Joaquin Diaz, a 31-year-old construction worker from the Bronx, in New York, said he tried the chip a few weeks ago after coming across social media videos about the challenge. He said he loves spicy food and wanted to see how he'd stack up. Diaz told The Associated Press by phone Friday that the chip was very hot, but he didn\u2019t expect the stomach cramps and diarrhea that followed and led to him missing work the next day. \u201cIt hurt, I\u2019m not gonna lie. I was actually a little nervous,\u201d he said. Despite the stomach issues, Diaz said he had planned to try the chip again with some friends. But he decided not to after he heard about Wolobah's death. Roger Trier, a 56-year-old content creator and graphic designer from Palatine, Illinois, posted video on TikTok and YouTube of himself completing a 100-chip challenge this month. He told the AP that he has trained for over 20 years to build up his spice tolerance. \u201cMost people you see on social media \u2014 with any challenges \u2014 don\u2019t understand the consequences,\" he said. Trier said he thinks people under the age of 18 shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do spicy challenges without adult supervision because they might not know how to deal with the intense reactions the food can cause or the peer pressure that can push them to take risks they don't understand. Although the chip could still be bought in some stores as of Thursday, by Friday it had disappeared from the shelves of major retailers, including 7-Eleven and Walgreens. Amazon halted sales and was notifying customers who bought the product recently that Paqui was removing it. And eBay said it was blocking One Chip Challenge listings. Sales of the chip seem largely driven by people posting videos on social media of them or their friends taking the challenge. They show people, including children, unwrapping the packaging, eating the chips and then reacting to the heat. Some videos show people gagging, coughing and begging for water. Neither Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, Google, which owns YouTube, nor TikTok immediately replied to Friday requests for comment about whether they were taking any action. Paqui, a Texas-based subsidiary of , said in a statement posted on its website Thursday that it was \u201cdeeply saddened by the death\u201d of Wolobah. \u201cWe have seen an increase in teens and other individuals not heeding these warnings,\u201d the company said. \u201cAs a result, while the product continues to adhere to food safety standards, out of abundance of caution, we are actively working with retailers to remove the product from shelves.\u201d At the vigil Friday, a crowd of about 100, including many of Wolobah\u2019s friends and teammates, turned out to a park in Worcester, down the hill from his home. They lit candles, swapped stories and ate pizza. Huge photos of the dread-locked teen hung from a statue, surrounded by his name in gold letters and blue and white balloons. Tiny basketballs were handed out. The most poignant moment came when Wolobah\u2019s mother, Lois, approached her son\u2019s photo, staring up at it, calling out his name several times and sobbing. She almost collapsed at one point and had to be held up by other family members as a relative addressed the crowd. \u201cI look around and see a community bond together by candlelight, by love and by the memory of our brother, of our son, of our nephew Harris,\u201d his cousin Valerie Richardson said. \u201cHarris had this gift for bringing people together. I can\u2019t think of a better way to honor him than what we are doing right here, right now.\u201d Massachusetts authorities posted a warning to parents about the challenge. And physicians cautioned that eating such spicy foods can have unintended consequences. \u201cYou can have very mild symptoms like burning or tingling of the lips in the mouth, but you can also have more severe symptoms,\u201d like significant abdominal pain or nausea and vomiting said Dr. Lauren Rice, the chief of pediatric emergency medicine at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. Dr. Peter Chai, an associate professor of emergency medicine and medical toxicology at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, said the chips can be dangerous under certain circumstances. \u201cIt's possible eating these chips with high concentration of capsaicin could cause death,\u201d Chai said, referring to the component of chili peppers that gives them their heat. \u201cIt would really depend on the amount of capsaicin that an individual was exposed to. At high doses, it can lead to fatal dysrhythmia or irreversible injury to the heart.\u201d ___ Associated Press reporters Rodrique Ngowe, Haleluya Hadero in Jersey City, New Jersey, Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit, and Trisha Ahmed in Minneapolis contributed to this report. \ud83d\udcec Sign up for the Daily Brief Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.",

        "description": "The French cookware brand is making collectors out of a new generation of home cooks",
        "content": "-- Shares Facebook Twitter Reddit Email It takes a certain kind of cookware to be regarded as both an heirloom and a TikTok darling. It's not going to be your standard Circulon, Farberware or Hamilton Beach \u2014 but rather, something that is both timelessly durable, yet speaks to the current aesthetics of adulthood. I'm talking about Le Creuset , of course, the famed Instagram-friendly brand of bright colored pots, pans and sturdy Dutch ovens. Sure, the price tag attached to each signature item is enough to make many shudder (said Dutch oven in a 7.25-quart size runs about $368.99) but there's no denying the fact that Le Creuset has been sought out \u2014 and adored \u2014 by many. After all, the French enamel cookware company has managed to effortlessly blur the line between functional cookware and home decor. Some are in it for efficiency. Others, mainly for the visuals and design. That's what makes the brand so fascinating. In recent years, we've seen similar trendy brands crop up, both online and across big-box retail chains. There's the minimalist-themed Our Place , which is the maker behind the cult-favorite all-in-one nonstick Always Pan . There's the simplistic Phantom Chef , the eclectic Great Jones and the sleek-and-chic Material Kitchen . But none of them have been able to attain the fanbase or cultural significance that Le Creuset continues to revel in \u2014 but this isn't just among legacy home cooks or well-established homeowners. Le Creuset is quite popular amongst Gen-Zers, thanks partially to the online cottagecore trend, which branched away from Pinterest and found a new home on TikTok amid the pandemic. Now, the hashtag #LeCreuSlay occasionally trends on the platform as videos showing young influencers and cooks Le Creuset hauls have garnered over 84.2 million views; the brand itself has 2.1 million likes and over 200,000 followers. So what exactly is the appeal? Some may point to the brand's reputation as a wise investment if you're going to make a habit of cooking. Namely, it's that classic Dutch oven that has garnered the most acclaim from chefs, critics and home cooks. Take it from Insider's Connie Chen , who explained, \"Basically, Le Creuset is the rare brand that's really as good as everyone says it is. The experience is kind of like going to your first SoulCycle class \u2014 you enter a cynic, but you emerge (hopefully less sweaty) a zealous convert.\" Related Everything you need to know about Dutch oven cooking It's why so many cooking enthusiasts are willing to spend anywhere between $260 to $625 just to get their hands on a Dutch oven \u2014 and frankly, any kind of cookware from the brand. The quality is top-notch. The longevity is stellar. And yes, the excellent craftsmanship is an added perk. As Mary Claire Lagroue of Food & Wine wrote, \"What sets Le Creuset apart from others is quality, performance (more on that later), and durability. The pieces are handmade, with the help of machines for smoothing, and multiple people inspect each one during production to ensure that it's as close to perfection as possible.\" Lagroue added that she's cooked with her own Le Creuset 7.25-quart round Dutch oven for an astounding four years. Her pots \u2014 one that belonged to her mother and another that she bought for herself \u2014 held up to high heat, scrubbing off stuck-on food, the dishwasher, and even a move across the country. It also helps that the pots are incredibly easy to clean and aren't prone to staining, despite their white interior. \"Le Creuset's 7.25-quart round Dutch oven is the one piece of cookware I'd recommend to anyone who's serious about cooking, regardless of their experience,\" Lagroue continued in her review. \"While the initial investment is higher, a well-made Dutch oven like this can last a lifetime if you treat it well.\" Le Creuset's fanbase also includes its avid super-collectors, who drop hundreds (even thousands) to stock up on items. That entails spending hours scouring the internet for online sales, raiding discount shops and hunting down vintage cookware. \"It can be a consuming, expensive and deeply personal hobby. To the obsessed, there's always another piece calling their name,\" wrote The Guardian's Jill Schildhouse . \"Each recipe requires a particular vessel, each season a suitable hue, and each dinner party a special display detail.\" However, it's worth remember that many Gen-Zers aren't living on their own. Nor are they necessarily cooking or hosting in the same way as millennials or Gen-Xers, so nostalgia is another key factor in Le Creuset's appeal. The brand's chip-resistant enameled cast iron means it can last for years (we're talking more than 40 years , in some instances), as long as it's treated properly with care. That can't be said for many conventional brand cookware, which are more likely to rust and scratch with increased use. Le Creuset, though, is a brand that can be passed down from generation after generation. And what's better than being able to cook your favorite comfort meal using a pan from your mother's kitchen and even, your grandmother's? We need your help to stay independent Subscribe today to support Salon's progressive journalism But in the end, Gen-Zers are also drawn to Le Creuset for the same reasons that their parents, as well as their parents, were. The nostalgia-inducing Dutch ovens, posts and pans are emblematic of adulthood. Historically, they belong in the kitchen of someone who has their life together enough to host actual dinner parties \u2014 or at least on the wedding registry of a couple who plans to entertain once they are finally settled. What does being settled look like in a country facing crippling inflation, pervasive housing crises and the looming threat of another global pandemic? Who really knows. That said, while some of the realities of adulthood have changed, Le Creuset hasn't. And as the adage says, old is new again \u2014 the recent fashion world obsession with \" quiet luxury \" is a prime example of this. So, how did Le Creuset, the self-described heirloom-quality cookware , become a new Gen-Z icon? The brand managed to create something that's practical but also, classically beautiful. Each and every piece is a cooking and art crossover, which is essential for success in a food world where \"the camera eats first.\" If you want your cookware to be able to whip up your favorite homemade stew, Le Creuset has just the items for you. And if you want your cookware to just sit pretty on your kitchen countertop, Le Creuset also has just the items for you. It's a versatile brand that essentially appeals to the pragmatic chef, art curator or Instagram influencer. Perhaps they'll make collectors of a new generation.

        "content": "Retail weed sales in Massachusetts hit the $5 billion mark, according to a press release from the state\u2019s Cannabis Control Commission (CCC). In January, adult-use sales reached $4 billion and a mere eight months later surged to $5 billion. With more East Coast states launching legal marijuana programs, some in Massachusetts worried that competition in the neighborhood might cut into the state\u2019s sales. But that obviously didn\u2019t happen. The eight-month period between the $4 billion and $5 billion benchmarks was a remarkably short time to generate $1 billion in sales. \u201cMassachusetts continues to hit record sales even as other states have come online. In fact, our neighboring states Maine, Rhode Island, and Connecticut also had record sales this summer,\u201d said CCC executive director Shawn Collins in a statement . \u201cDemand for tested, quality cannabis products remains strong in the region, and consumers shopping in other states have not impacted Massachusetts\u2019 success.\u201d Since the first two recreational cannabis shops opened in Massachusetts - the first on the East Coast - in November 2018, \"the pace of hitting the next $1 billion aggregate gross sales milestone has continued to quicken, with each subsequent tally occurring faster than the previous one,\u201d the CCC noted in the statement. A Friend In High Places At a June gathering in Boston, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) threw down the gauntlet when she called for cannabis laws to keep corporations like Big Tobacco, alcohol and retail giants from dominating the cannabis industry and ensure that communities most harmed by the war on drugs also reap the benefits of legalization. \u201cAlready, aspiring weed billionaires and powerful corporations like Amazon AMZN and Altria (NYSE: M O ) (aka Philip Morris) are hounding Congress to pass bills that would let them be the first to profit from federal legalization\u2014 leaving behind small business owners and the many communities that were torn apart by decades of over-policing,\u201d Warren said. \u201cNow is the time to get creative and think big about how we can ensure fairness and competition in the cannabis industry,\u201d the Senator added.",

(Sep)NOTE: Previews are listed in day orderNORWEGIAN CPI (MON): The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced.UK UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES (TUE): Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end.UK GDP ESTIMATE (WED): A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought.US CPI (WED): Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern.ECB ANNOUNCEMENT (THU): 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%.AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYMENT (THU): participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms.SWEDISH CPIF (THU): July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak.US RETAIL SALES (THU): Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July. While the data set will offer a glimpse on the health of the consumer amid concerns that the economy may slow significantly in the months ahead, traders will also be watching the University of Michigan's prelim survey release due Friday, where the rise in energy prices is likely to have weighed on sentiment.CHINESE ACTIVITY DATA (FRI): Retail sales Y/Y in August are expected to rise by 2.8% (prev. 2.5%), whilst there is currently no consensus for Industrial Production metrics. The data will be closely watched to diagnose the health of the world\u2019s second-larger economy and to gauge the drip-feed of stimulus seen over recent weeks. Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d.This article originally appeared on Newsquawk This article was written by Newsquawk Analysis at www.forexlive.com.",
        "content": ": The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced. : Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end. : A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought. : Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern. : 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%. : participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms. : July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak. : Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July.

        "description": "Monday:ECB\u2019s Wunsch (hawk \u2013 non voter) remains in favour of raising interest rates again:Underlying inflation remains persistent, may need more rate hikes.I\u2019m inclined to say we maybe need to do a little bit more.The idea that we\u2019ll have to come to a pause at a certain point can\u2019t be excluded, but it\u2019s too early to talk about stopping hiking completely.The Switzerland Q2 GDP missed expectations as the monetary tightening is starting to bite more heavily:GDP Q2 0.0% vs. 0.1% expected and 0.3% prior. ECB\u2019s Lagarde (hawk \u2013 voter) is focused on the inflation expectations and keeping them in check:It is exactly when people are paying most attention that central banks should deliver their key communication to ensure that those expectations remain firmly anchored.It will be critical for central banks to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored while these relative price changes play out.Tuesday:Chinese Caixin Services PMI missed expectations by a big margin although remaining in expansion:Services PMI 51.8 vs. 53.6 expected and 54.1 prior.The RBA left the cash rate unchanged as expected at 4.10%: Inflation in Australia has passed its peak. But inflation is still too high and will remain so for some time yet.The Australian economy is experiencing a period of below-trend growth. Returning inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe remains the priority. There are significant uncertainties around the outlook.Services price inflation has been surprisingly persistent overseas and the same could occur in Australia.Some further tightening of monetary policy may be required.Will continue to pay close attention to developments in the global economy, trends in household spending, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market.ECB\u2019s Lane (dove \u2013 voter) didn\u2019t offer much in terms of forward guidance:August inflation data is welcome, but we need to see that continue.We do expect bumpiness in easing of energy, food inflation.Easing in services inflation helps limit narrative that tourism is keeping services inflation high.The Eurozone July PPI beat expectations, but the figures were still all negative:PPI M/M -0.5% vs. -0.6% expected and -0.4% prior.PPI Y/Y -7.6% vs. -7.6% expected and -3.4% prior. ECB\u2019s Schnabel (hawk \u2013 voter) touched on climate change and how it could bring downside tail risks:Climate change is an existential threat with large downside tail risks.Climate-related and environmental risks (C&E risks) are now an important focal point for supervisors.Climate change constitutes an existential threat, implying large downside tail risks.Dealing with financial risks is the core of prudential supervision. Physical climate risks tend to be correlated globally.The economic consequences of physical climate risks could be mitigated by closing the large climate insurance protection gap.In the EU, only a quarter of losses caused by climate-related catastrophes are insured.Fed\u2019s Waller (hawk \u2013 voter) changed his stance and he\u2019s now leaning towards a pause:I would say the risks to doing too much and too little are balanced.The data last week clearly showed the jobs market is starting to soften. Unemployment is about where it was a year ago, so change isn't that big.Recessions are often caused by shocks that come out of nowhere, but the data so far is pretty good (for a soft landing).I want to be very careful to say that 'we've done the job'.I want to see 'a couple months' of data.I don't think one more hike would send the economy into a recession.Data will drive whether the Fed hikes again.Recent data will allow the Fed to proceed carefully.We're starting to see the economy slow down.Treasury yields are about where they should be.The US economy is 'about 80% closed' so impacts from abroad will be smaller than for others.We've been keeping a very close eye on commercial real estate, will continue to roll over during the next 2 years or so.We're not sure about what prices CRE will be trading at in two years.Saudi Arabia announced that it would extend the voluntary 1 million barrels per day output cut through December and Russia quickly followed by saying it was cutting exports by 300k bpd through year end. Both added that caveat that the decision would be reviewed monthly. Fed\u2019s Mester (hawk \u2013 non voter) maintained her hawkish stance as she sees the need to go a \u201clittle bit\u201d higher on rates:The labour market has come more into balance.From what I see so far, we might have to go a bit higher, we might have to raise the policy rate a bit more.There is still a lot of time before our next decision in September and we will get a lot of data and information by then.Gasoline prices are rising again. We have to be very attentive to that.The longer inflation stays above 2%, the more likely it is that the risks will materialise.If we end up raising interest rates too much and the economy loses momentum more than necessary, we can lower interest rates.We will certainly not continue to raise interest rates until inflation has already fallen to 2%. Nor will we wait to lower interest rates until inflation is at 2%.There are upside risks to our inflation forecasts, in my view.Wednesday:The Australian Q2 GDP beat expectations:GDP Q2 0.4% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% prior.BoJ\u2019s Takata sounded optimistic on hitting the inflation target but remains wary of downside risks:Japan is seeing early signs of hitting 2% inflation.Japan's economy is recovering moderately.He believes that the Bank of Japan must patiently maintain easy monetary policy given the very high uncertainty on the outlook.At the same time, BOJ must respond nimbly to uncertainty with eye on economic, price outlook.There's a chance Japan will see shift in public perception prices and wages won't rise much.Japan seeing signs of change in corporate wage, price-setting behaviour.There is sign of change in Japan's trend inflation as rising wages push up inflation expectations.Inflation is already exceeding BOJ's 2% target but there is some distance to achieving it stably and in sustainable fashion.If overseas economies slow sharply, that could weigh on Japan's economy.Stronger than expected US economy having an impact on currencies.Overseas factors having greater impact on currencies.We need to stand ready to flexibly respond to uncertainty.Action in July was a flexible response.ECB\u2019s Villeroy (neutral \u2013 voter) is leaning more towards keeping interest rates high for longer rather than raising them more:There is a slowdown but no recession.Had first successes against inflation but need to persevere.Must bring inflation down to 2% level between now and 2025.We are near or very near the peak on interest rates.Our options are open at the next and upcoming rate meetings.Maintaining rates for a sufficiently long period now counts more than further rate hikes.ECB\u2019s Knot (hawk \u2013 voter) didn\u2019t sound much confident on a September rate hike:Markets may be underestimating September rate hike chances.Bringing inflation to 2% by the end of 2025 is the bare minimum.Rate hike is a possibility, not a certainty.The Eurozone July Retail Sales missed expectations on the M/M figure but beat on the Y/Y one:Retail Sales M/M -0.2% vs. -0.1% expected and 0.2% prior (revised from -0.3%).Retail Sales Y/Y -1.0% vs. -1.2% expected and -1.0% prior (revised from -1.0%).ECB\u2019s Kazimir (hawk \u2013 voter) favours one last rate hike:The preferable option would be to hike rates by 25 bps next week.One more, likely last rate hike, still needed.The alternative option would be to hike in October or December.Inflation remains stubbornly high, price growth expectations too far above 2%.Fed\u2019s Collins (neutral \u2013 non voter) is leaning towards a high for longer stance rather than a higher for longer one:It's time for monetary policy to be patient and deliberate.Fed should 'allow time' when making monetary policy choices.Too soon to say inflation sustainably moving back to target.Fed must balance lowering inflation against slowing economy too much.Fed can likely achieve goals without causing notable economic pain.Still too much job market demand.Wage growth remains elevated.Core services inflation moderation has been modest.Expects economy to slow into end of year.BoE\u2019s Bailey (neutral \u2013 voter) is expecting a \u201cmarked\u201d fall in inflation by year-end:Wage bargaining has surprised to the upside.There has been a very large terms of trade shock in this country.Many indicators are signalling a fall in inflation, which will be marked by the end of this year.Question is: As headline inflation comes down, will we see inflation expectations continue to come down and will that impact wage bargaining?There is not group think at the MPC at the moment.BoE\u2019s Dhingra (dove \u2013 voter) maintains her dovish stance as she expects the monetary policy lags to start affecting the economy more heavily:Labour market continues to ease as MPC's hiking cycle takes effect with a lag.Pass-through of level changes to wages would not necessarily pose a risk to our target in the medium term.Not yet evidence to suggest firms will seek to increase their margins.Domestic factors are likely to continue to ease the pressure on CPI inflation.The Bank of Canada kept interest rates steady at 5.00% as expected:The Canadian economy has entered a period of weaker growth. The tightness in the labour market has continued to ease gradually. Recent CPI data indicate that inflationary pressures remain broad-based. With the recent increase in gasoline prices, CPI inflation is expected to be higher in the near term before easing again. With recent evidence that excess demand in the economy is easing, and given the lagged effects of monetary policy, Governing Council decided to hold the policy interest rate at 5%.Governing Council remains concerned about the persistence of underlying inflationary pressures, and is prepared to increase the policy interest rate further if needed. Growth prospects in China have diminished. In the United States, growth was stronger than expected.The US ISM Services PMI beat expectations by a big margin coming at 54.5 vs. 52.5 expected and 52.7 prior:employment index 54.7 vs. 50.7 prior.new orders index 57.5 vs. 55.0 prior.prices paid index 58.9 vs. 56.8 prior.new export orders 62.1 vs. 61.1 prior.imports 52.3 vs. 52.3 prior.backlog of orders 41.8 vs. 52.1 prior.inventories 57.7 vs. 50.4 prior.supplier deliveries 48.5 vs. 48.1 prior.inventory sentiment 61.5 vs. 56.6 prior.The Fed release the Beige Book which provides recent anecdotal information on current economic conditions: Most Districts indicated economic growth was modest during July and August. Consumer spending on tourism was stronger than expected but other retail spending continued to slow, especially non-essential.Some Districts highlighted reports suggesting consumers may have exhausted their savings and are relying more on borrowing to support spending. New auto sales did expand in many Districts, but contacts noted this had more to do with better availability of inventory rather than increased consumer demand. Manufacturing contacts in several Districts also noted that supply chain delays improved. New orders were stable or declined in most Districts, and backlogs shortened. Nearly all Districts reported the inventory of homes for sale remained constrained.Some Districts reported higher delinquencies on consumer credit lines.Job growth was subdued across the nation. Nearly all Districts indicated businesses renewed their previously unfulfilled expectations that wage growth will slow broadly in the near term.Most Districts reported price growth slowed overall, decelerating faster in manufacturing and consumer-goods sectors.Thursday:BoJ Nakagawa thinks that it\u2019s appropriate to maintain easy monetary policy for now but there are signs that inflation is on path to achieve their target and the risk that it could even accelerate more than expected:Appropriate to maintain easy monetary policy for time being.Signs of change seen in Japan's corporate price, wage-setting behaviour.Still not at stage where we can say Japan has stably, sustainably achieved BOJ\u2019s price targetMonetary easing involves various side-effects.BOJ will conduct flexible market operation when 10-year JGB yield moves in range of 0.5-1.0% range with eye on interest rate levels and speed of moves.BOJ\u2019s July decision has heightened sustainability of its monetary easing framework.Japan's capex, consumption increasing moderately.Japan's economy likely to continue recovering moderately.Our baseline scenario is for consumer inflation to gradually re-accelerate after a period of slowdown.There is chance inflation could accelerate more than expected, though there is also chance pass-through of costs could moderate.Job market tightening but outlook for wages also depends on corporate earnings.Price rises for goods broadening, service prices also rising mainly for accommodation fees.Must be vigilant to risk of further slowdown in global growth.Sees equal degree of upside and downside risks to inflation.Can exit NIRP when economy is strong enough.But there is no preset idea on order or timing of that.It depends on financial developments at the time.Does not want to comment on FX levels.Strong outcome in next year's wage talks would be a necessary condition, though not a sufficient one to contemplate pursuing end of negative rates.Want to look at various factors beyond wages in deciding future policy changes.Further YCC tweak cannot be ruled out but is not an imminent issue now.The Chinese trade data beat expectations but the readings remain very poor:Exports Y/Y -8.8% vs. -9.2% expected and -14.5% prior. Imports Y/Y -7.3% vs. -9.0% expected and -12.4% prior. RBA\u2019s Lowe gave his final speech as Governor as Deputy Governor Bullock will take over as the new head on September 18:My recent focus is risk wages, profits run ahead of rates consistent with return to inflation target.If this risk materialised and inflation became sticky, would require tighter monetary policy.Will be difficult to return to the earlier world in which inflation tracked in a very narrow range.Inflation is likely to be more variable around target.Australia has been well served by a flexible inflation target.Possible that Australia can sustain unemployment rates below what we have had over the past 40 years.Now in an environment of stronger growth in nominal wages, which is positive.The recent productivity record isn\u2019t encouraging; solution fundamentally a political problem.Interest rates influence housing prices but are not reason Australia has some of the highest prices in the world.Issue that defined my term more than any other was forward guidance on rates during the pandemic.Guidance was widely interpreted as a commitment, rather than a conditional statement.With the benefit of hindsight, my view is that we did do too much during pandemic.The Switzerland August seasonally adjusted Unemployment Rate remained steady at 2.1% vs. 2.1% expected and 2.1% prior. The Eurozone Q2 Final GDP reading was 0.1% vs. 0.3% expected as the previous estimate was revised to 0.1%:Household consumption flat.Government expenditure 0.1%.Gross fixed capital formation 0.1%.External balance -0.4%.Changes in inventories 0.4%.The US Jobless Claims beat expectations by a big margin across the board: Initial Claims 216K vs. 234K expected and 228K prior. Continuing Claims 1679K vs. 1715K expected and 1725K prior. The BoC Governor Macklem delivered a hawkish speech titled \"staying the course\u201d:We are concerned that progress in bringing down inflation has slowed.We are prepared to raise rates again but don't want to raise rates than we have to.The longer we wait, the harder it is likely to be to reduce inflation.Monetary policy might not be restrictive enough to restore price stability.Bank is concerned that larger-than-normal price increases for goods and services remain broad based.We are not trying to kill economic growth.The biggest contribution to the slowing in inflation since the peak last year has been from energy, which accounts for two-thirds of the slowdown.Today, about 60% of CPI components are rising above 3% and about 45% are rising above 5%.Looking ahead, we want to see less-generalized price increases as well as a decline in the average price increase.The weakness in second-quarter GDP largely reflected a broad-based slowing in consumer spending and a decline in housing activity.We will be watching wage growth closely.Maybe we don't need to do more, maybe we do on interest rates.We will take decisions meeting by meeting.Expecting growth of 'a little less than 1%' over the next few quarters.You can expect headline inflation is going to go up in the near term, before it eases.Fed\u2019s Williams (neutral \u2013 voter) just expressed the uncertainty policymakers are currently facing:Labor market balances are evening out.There's still more data to come before next FOMC meeting.Inflation is far too high but moving down.Policy is in a good place, is data dependent.We are seeing movement in the right direction for the economy.It's an open question if monetary policy is restrictive enough.The latest consumer spending data has been strong.Expects unemployment rate to rise to low 4% range.Fed\u2019s Goolsbee (dove \u2013 voter) maintains his stance as he prefers to keep rates high for longer rather than higher for longer:It's possible we can get on 'golden path'.Monetary policy is working.Overall level of inflation is above where we want it.Clearly there are risks.China, US government shutdown are among possible risks.We have also had false dawns on inflation before.Want to see progress on core inflation, especially goods and housing.Market's expectations on inflation also have a major influence.I'd pay less attention to wage growth as an indicator of inflation.We are very rapidly approaching time when are argument is not about how high should rates go, but rather how long rates have to stay high.Collectively Fed forecast is that rates will have to stay up for a relatively extended period.You can't change the inflation target until you've hit your inflation target.We have to get to the 2% inflation target, retain credibility.A possible UAW strike could have an impact, it could be material to our decisions.Fed\u2019s Logan (hawk \u2013 voter) called for a skip at the upcoming September FOMC meeting:'Could be appropriate' to skip interest-rate increase in September.There is 'work left to do' to get to sufficiently restrictive policy.Skipping does not imply stopping rate hikes.Not yet convinced we've extinguished excess inflation.Fed needs to calibrate policy 'carefully,' must proceed gradually.Significantly lower inflation in recent months 'encouraging,' but too soon to confidently say on path to 2% in timely way.Job market strength suggests we have not finished the job of restoring price stability.If stronger economic activity continues, could lead to a resurgence of inflation.Friday:Japan July Average Cash Earnings growth slowed down more, and the wages data is something the BoJ is particularly focused on:Average Cash Earnings Y/Y 1.3% vs. 2.3% prior. Real Wages Y/Y -2.5%.Household spending -5.00% vs. -4.2% prior.The Japanese Final Q2 GDP missed expectations and the previous reading was revised downwards:Japan Q2 GDP 1.2% vs. 1.3% expected and 0.8% prior (revised from 1.5%).GDP Growth Annualised 4.8% vs. 5.5% expected and 3.2% prior (revised from 6%).The Canadian Jobs report showed another pick up in wage growth which is something the BoC is particularly focused on:Employment change 39.9K vs. 20.0K expected and -6.4K prior.Full time 32.2K vs. 1.7K prior.Part time 7.8K vs. -8.1K prior.Participation rate 65.5% vs. 65.6% expected and 65.6% prior.Average hourly wages permanent employees 5.2% vs. 4.7% expected and 5.0% prior.Unemployment rate 5.5% vs. 5.6% expected and 5.5% prior.The highlights for next week will be:Tuesday: UK Labour Market report, German ZEW, US NFIB Small Business Optimism Index.Wednesday: Japan PPI, UK GDP, EZ Industrial Production, US CPI.Thursday: Australia Labour Market report, Japan Industrial Production, Switzerland PPI, ECB Policy Decision, US Jobless Claims, US PPI, US Retail Sales.Friday: NZ Manufacturing PMI, China Industrial Production and Retail Sales, Eurozone Wages data, US University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment.

        "content": "A new Utah Foundation report affirms the more postsecondary education a person has, there\u2019s a better return on investment. But the report, titled \u201cBang for your buck: Which Utah schools have the best return on investment,\u201d also indicates much depends on what a student studies and the workforce demand for those credentials. The report, which examined return on investment at Utah\u2019s public and private colleges and universities, found Weber State University is tops for students\u2019 10-year net present value of their education. This was calculated by how much a certain sum of money \u2014 in this case, the future earnings of additional education minus the cost of that education \u2014 would be worth today. The report shows that the first-year returns of graduates of some Weber State University associate degree programs \u2014 computer science, industrial production technologies, nursing and allied health professions \u2014 outstrip the median bachelor\u2019s degree programs. Graduates of Weber State\u2019s manufacturing engineering technology associate degree program \u2014 its plastics and composites concentration, for one \u2014 experience first-year median returns of nearly $69,000, according to the report. The median return on investment for those who earn associate degrees in computer science from Weber State is $58,224 and $48,672 for nursing. Nursing students Kalley Jaques and Aisha Holts work on a central line change as students work in the simulation lab in the Marriott Health Building at Weber State University in Ogden on Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2023. Scott G Winterton, Deseret News \u201cBachelor\u2019s degrees in Utah are more likely to pay off in the longer run \u2014 though Weber State University defies this trend. The most common credential from Weber State University is an associate\u2019s degree, though they also offer certifications and bachelor\u2019s degrees,\u201d the report states. The university also offers a wide array of graduate degree programs, including a doctorate of nursing practice and a physician assistant program. Weber State University Provost Ravi Krovi said the report was welcome news to administrators and educators striving to offer programs that meet workforce needs and help graduates earn higher wages. \u201cWe were thrilled but we\u2019re not altogether surprised. It\u2019s sort of validating, quite honestly. We certainly want to tell our story but when you have data which comes in and proves it, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s even better,\u201d he said. Krovi said Weber State University has made \u201ca conscious attempt to really focus on cost from a tuition and fees perspective. Our tuition and fees have not gone up that much. If you go back to the last 10 years, it\u2019s less than the overall increase in the consumer price index.\u201d The university has made guided pathways a priority, too, he said. \u201cAs students come in, we try to give them a better perspective of what are the options and so I think it\u2019s one thing to give advice, but it\u2019s also important to have the right type of programming. Stackable programs really help us from that standpoint,\u201d he said. A student might come to Weber State with the goal of earning a certificate, which are short-term programs. Once they grow accustomed to the college experience, the hope is they will feel more comfortable and confident about seeking an associate degree or even a bachelor\u2019s degree, he said. \u201cThat transition and transfer is a lot more seamless because it\u2019s all our curriculum, our program. So I think that mission, the dual mission for us, is really helpful for students,\u201d Krovi said. Nursing student Whitney Weston works out a few mathematical problems as she and other students go about their work in the simulation lab in the Marriott Health Building at Weber State University in Ogden on Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2023. Scott G Winterton, Deseret News The report also notes Salt Lake Community College\u2019s large variety of associate degrees. Its computer and information sciences program, for example, \u201chas a first-year return on investment of a whopping $53,628,\u201d the report states. Associate degrees with the highest median earnings include engineering and architecture. Median earnings are also higher than average for public safety, nursing, construction and manufacturing, business and agriculture degrees, according to the report. The report also found that the private, for-profit Neumont College of Computer Science had the highest ranked 40-year net present value of any college in Utah, followed by Brigham Young University, the University of Utah, Weber State and Westminster University. The report explores the financial return on investment for education beyond high school \u2014 or whether pursuing certificates, certification, associate degrees and bachelor\u2019s degrees make financial sense. \u201cResearch suggests that the return on investment for education beyond high school is generally worth the time and effort,\u201d the report states. But degree selection and workforce and industry needs can make a difference. According to the report, more than a quarter of those with associate degrees earn more than the median bachelor\u2019s degree wage and 35% of those with bachelor\u2019s degrees earn more than the median master\u2019s degree wage.

        "description": "Week Ahead 11th-15th SeptemberMON: Norwegian CPI (Aug)TUE: EIA STEO, OPEC MOMR; Swedish Unemployment (Aug), UK Unemployment (Aug) & Wages (Jul), NorwegianGDP (Jul), Germany/EZ ZEW (Sep)WED: IEA OMR; UK GDP Estimate (Jul), US CPI (Aug)THU: ECB Policy Announcement, Norges Bank Regional Network; Australian Employment (Aug), Swedish CPIF (Aug),US Retail Sales (Aug), IJC (w/e 4th Sep), New Zealand Manufacturing PMI (Aug)FRI: Quad Witching, CBR Policy Announcement, ECB TLTRO Repayment Publication; Chinese Industrial Output/Production, Retail Sales, House Prices (Aug), EZ Trade Balance (Jul), US Export/Import Prices (Aug), IndustrialProduction (Aug), NY Fed Manufacturing (Sep), Uni. of Michigan Prelim. (Sep)NOTE: Previews are listed in day orderNORWEGIAN CPI (MON): The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced.UK UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES (TUE): Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end.UK GDP ESTIMATE (WED): A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought.US CPI (WED): Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern.ECB ANNOUNCEMENT (THU): 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%.AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYMENT (THU): participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms.SWEDISH CPIF (THU): July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak.US RETAIL SALES (THU): Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July. While the data set will offer a glimpse on the health of the consumer amid concerns that the economy may slow significantly in the months ahead, traders will also be watching the University of Michigan's prelim survey release due Friday, where the rise in energy prices is likely to have weighed on sentiment.CHINESE ACTIVITY DATA (FRI): Retail sales Y/Y in August are expected to rise by 2.8% (prev. 2.5%), whilst there is currently no consensus for Industrial Production metrics. The data will be closely watched to diagnose the health of the world\u2019s second-larger economy and to gauge the drip-feed of stimulus seen over recent weeks. Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d.This article originally appeared on Newsquawk This article was written by Newsquawk Analysis at www.forexlive.com.",

        "description": "The Haunted Mansion's infamous villain is finally coming to Florida.",
        "content": "A lot of exciting Disney Parks news came out of Destination 23 today , and fans of Disney World and Disneyland are excited about the upcoming changes. One new change comes on the heels of the release of Haunted Mansion , the latest film to be based on the beloved attraction. The film's villain was the Hatbox Ghost (Jared Leto), the animatronic character who originally appeared in Disneyland's Haunted Mansion ride before being removed shortly after the ride debuted in 1969. However, the Hatbox Ghost was brought back to Anaheim in 2015, and now he's finally coming to the Magic Kingdom in Orlando. It was announced during Destination 23 that the Hatbox Ghost is coming to the Haunted Mansion attraction in Florida in late November. Disney Imagineer Daniel Joseph joined Experiences and Products Chairman Josh D'Amaro on stage for the announcement earlier today. Joseph revealed the Hatbox Ghost will be materializing in the Haunted Mansion as you pass the attraction's Endless Hallway. In the original ride, the ghost appeared holding a hatbox, and the goal was for his head to materialize inside the hatbox. However, the limitations of effects in the late '60s never allowed it to be pulled off properly. In the years since the figure's removal, he earned a mythical reputation among Disney enthusiasts, only for the character to make his official return with modern upgrades in 2015. Haunted Mansion Director on Jared Leto's Hatbox Ghost: \"It's very surprising. You'd be shocked to know who it was until you're told,\" Justin Simien revealed to Entertainment Weekly . \"The character itself, it's part digital, part physical performance. We're trying to go for something scary that feels like it could exist physically in the real world, on the ride, but pushes the scare a lot further than the ride does. He knocked it out of the park. He's very menacing and terrifying.\" In Haunted Mansion , a doctor (Rosario Dawson) and her 9-year-old son (Chase Dillon), looking to start a new life, move into a strangely affordable mansion in New Orleans , only to discover that the place is much more than they bargained for. Desperate for help, they contact a priest (Owen Wilson), who, in turn, enlists the aid of a widowed scientist-turned failed-paranormal expert (LaKeith Stanfield), a French Quarter psychic (Tiffany Haddish), and a crotchety historian (Danny DeVito). Stay tuned for more updates from Destination 23. 0 comments Related: All of the Haunted Mansion Movie's Biggest Connections to the Disney Ride Disney Theme Reveals Parks New Rides and Attractions Opening Dates First Look at New Avengers Ride at Disney California Adventure Park Revealed Disney Teases World Princess Week",

        "description": "Brian Ward, CEO of Savvy Gaming Group, is trying to change Saudi Arabia's reputation by leading its investments in gaming.",
        "content": "We're thrilled to announce the return of GamesBeat Next, hosted in San Francisco this October, where we will explore the theme of \"Playing the Edge.\" Apply to speak here and learn more about sponsorship opportunities here. At the event, we will also announce 25 top game startups as the 2024 Game Changers. Apply or nominate today ! Brian Ward, CEO of Savvy Games Group , has taken the lead in helping Saudi Arabia\u2019s attempt to move beyond its reputation for human rights abuses and being an oil nation to being a visionary technology leader bankrolling the game industry. This tension between the past and the future is ever-present in Saudi Arabia, where companies like Savvy Games Group \u2014 owned by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia \u2014 are trying to change perceptions through games while remaining cognizant of the kingdom\u2019s appetite for measured change. Ward believes people have to see the change happening in society on the ground in Saudi Arabia in order to understand how quickly things can happen under the new regime that is mostly supportive of the game industry. There is perhaps no other country where the clash between tradition and modernity \u2014 something my world history professor talked about so long ago \u2014 is so stark. The change and the deals have been happening at a dizzying rate. It\u2019s like a big game of Monopoly, and the playing board of the game industry is set up on a global scale. Savvy Games Group acquired Los Angeles-based mobile game publisher Scopely for $4.9 billion in April, and it bought a $1 billion stake in Sweden-based game publisher Embracer Group. It also acquired ESL Gaming and FaceIt in esports to create ESL FaceIt Group. And the Saudis have also bought stakes in Capcom, Nexon and Nintendo this year, building on stakes it acquired previously in Activision Blizzard, Take-Two Interactive and Electronic Arts. That has made the gaming world take notice. Savvy\u2019s big stakeholder, the Public Investment Fund (run by the Saudi Arabian government) is flush with cash from the oil boom and it has set aside $37.8 billion to build up Saudi Arabia\u2019s presence in the global games industry \u2013 with $13.3 billion of that earmarked for acquiring a major publisher. That\u2019s more money than anyone around the world is earmarking for gaming investments and acquisitions. It\u2019s a sign that the government is serious about weaning the country from oil. The Saudi Vision 2030 is a government program launched by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to diversify economically, socially and culturally, in line with the vision of bin Salman. The Saudis announced it in 2016, but the country remained about 74% dependent on oil exports as of 2021. The country understands that the oil economy could dry up in the next 27 years, and it has to have other jobs ready \u2014 and they are trickling in so far. For the games industry, this influx of Saudi money into games is not without controversy, as the Saudi funding is controversial and the company has only been at it since November 2021. Critics say that the regime of Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud doesn\u2019t respect human rights. As crown prince and prime minister, he was connected to the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 via alleged killers who had ties to the crown prince. Accepting funding from the Saudis under such a regime represents a moral quandary, as the Saudis have become a big source of funding in their efforts to diversify beyond their dependence on oil, which the world is in the process of moving away from in pursuit of clean energy. Saudi defenders say that all major sources of money in the world are tainted in some way, and accepting money from the Saudis does not mean you have to accept interference from the Saudis or embrace their agenda. Ward pointed out in an interview with GamesBeat that the country is undergoing change when it comes to women\u2019s rights and other freedoms, and it is serious about creating transformative results when it comes to diversity and new jobs associated with game studios. Still, given the fact that being gay is illegal in Saudi Arabia, The Last of Us Part 2 was banned in the country for having gay women in its leading roles. Ward has said the company aims to become a great games company and is not tied to a specific political agenda and he is not there for an \u201cimage makeover project.\u201d While change may be happening, it\u2019s not happening fast enough for critics. I caught up with Ward in an interview at the company\u2019s booth at the Gamescom expo in Cologne, Germany. Here\u2019s an edited transcript of our interview. Brian Ward: Sorry I wasn\u2019t able to meet before. GamesBeat: You guys were busy buying somebody. Brian Ward: That was a hectic time. GamesBeat: How are things going since then? Especially with acquiring Scopely. Ward: Very good. We\u2019re obviously delighted to have closed the transaction with Scopely. Their Monopoly Go product is fantastic. It\u2019s doing very well. The people are working super hard on integration. They\u2019ve been a pleasure to work with in that regard. So far we\u2019re delighted. GamesBeat: On things like esports, I wonder how much focus you have on MENA (Middle East/North Africa) versus the wider world. Ward: We\u2019re pretty globally focused. The live attendance on all the majors this year has been up. The viewership, the hours watched have been up. There have been some hiccups in the sector generally with publisher spend on esports this year, but overall the business has been doing great. We\u2019re focused on MENA, of course. The EFG folks are in the middle of executing on Gamers8. There are plans for that tournament to be bigger and more robust next year. There\u2019s a lot going on. The conference next week will be a good one. GamesBeat: Is that a first for them, or have they been doing them before? Ward: This is the second version of Next World Forum. Gamers8 started during COVID as Gamers Without Borders, for charity relief. This is the second version of both the G8 and the NWF. GamesBeat: Is there a feeling of progress as you come out of COVID? Esports had to take some huge hits during that time. It transformed a lot as well. Ward: I think we\u2019re beyond COVID. The capital markets, the economic situation last year and coming into this year, caused some publishers to pull back on their esports spend, which affected a couple of pieces of the business, but overall attendance is up. Viewership is up. There seems to be as much engagement as there was before from a fan point of view. GamesBeat: For Saudi gamers and Saudi esports fans, how would you describe the market? Ward: When we invested in EFG, it seemed that coming out of COVID \u2013 that was nearly two years ago now \u2013 it was an inflection point where engagement had changed or accelerated because of COVID, and there would be some consolidation in esports. There would be some dynamics that would sort themselves out, whether it\u2019s the relationship between players and teams and publishers and where the power base really sits. A lot of that still has to get sorted out. Team economics are not universally great. GamesBeat: The game industry itself, where do you see the trends developing? Ward: We\u2019re super excited, especially on the heels of closing Scopely. We\u2019re excited about mobile-first cross-platform opportunities. Scopely is also making great progress in direct payments. That\u2019s an interesting economic lever for us. For Savvy, we now have a great anchor in mobile. We\u2019re looking forward to figuring out how we can facilitate, like we\u2019re doing with Scopely, some partners in PC and console. GamesBeat: You\u2019re still looking around for opportunities? Ward: This year we haven\u2019t been looking at as many opportunities. We\u2019ve been focused internally on making sure we have the right leadership team in place. Scopely is a big acquisition. The integration is fairly involved. We\u2019re focused on making sure that we\u2019re putting some investment professionals in place, so we don\u2019t rely on external advisors as much. We\u2019re focused internally on our structure and governance and operating model, more so than looking for additional investments. GamesBeat: Were there some things that made you think that the period in which you were buying assets there \u2013 was that fortuitous in some ways? When there are downturns in the economy, prices for acquisitions are lower. It\u2019s a good time to buy. Did that matter to you? If you have strategic imperatives to move into a business fast, you probably don\u2019t care as much about the economic situation. Ward: That\u2019s true. It\u2019s very difficult to time the market. It\u2019s been fortuitous that valuations have come off a bit and those people with capital to employ have been in a market where it\u2019s been more difficult for people to find as many varied sources of capital as there were two years ago. That\u2019s advantageous to us. But we haven\u2019t pulled on that lever very hard. This year we\u2019ve been focused more internally. GamesBeat: For games it seems like there was a lot of pressure on valuations, after some very big excitement in 2021. Everybody thought that usage was going to go up forever. Is there a level-setting that you see that still reflects favorable trends? Ward: Overall, I think the trends are super favorable for the long term. We don\u2019t get too excited about this year versus last year or 2022 versus COVID. Long term we think this is probably the best entertainment business to be in. Yes, there\u2019s some sort of reconciliation. Figuring out where usage and engagement will land after COVID. But that will settle. GamesBeat: I listened to Take-Two\u2019s earnings call. It was interesting to hear Strauss Zelnick answer a question about games and Hollywood, all the synergy happening right now. Someone asked why they aren\u2019t doing more of that. He said, \u201cWe came from movies. It was a very hard business. There were many failures.\u201d For years everyone saw that the big opportunity was in games, so why would they go back in a big way? Although he did say that they\u2019re working on a Borderlands movie and some other projects. They\u2019re participating in that. But he felt like it was a no-brainer that gaming is still the more interesting business. Ward: It\u2019s kind of the flip side of the trend from 20 years ago, where movies became games. Now it\u2019s games becoming movies. GamesBeat: Do you think about that as an opportunity as well? Ward: Not yet. We\u2019re not focused on that at the moment. I still view us as a startup. We have maybe a couple hundred people in Saudi Arabia and 4,000 worldwide. We still have a lot of things to do in terms of building a games business. We have a pretty good esports business. GamesBeat: Are you focused on building a larger local staff? Ward: Very much so. The studio, which is now renamed Steer Studios, has done a super job. They now have about 80 people on two or three mobile teams, and 80% of them are Saudis. We\u2019re highly focused and highly incentivized against building out the local ecosystem. GamesBeat: How does that mix in with the Scopely business? Is it alongside Scopely? Ward: Scopely is very interested in the MENA region and expanding beyond their traditional markets. We expect that they\u2019ll be looking at opportunities in MENA and Saudi specifically. GamesBeat: How do you look back after some years on the issues around human rights that people have had with Saudi Arabia, whether or not they want to do business there? How is that turning out? Ward: My standard answer to this, or part of my standard answer, is for folks to take the time to understand what\u2019s going on there and how far this social transformation and economic diversification project is coming in the last five years. A tremendous amount of progress has been made toward Vision 2030 and all of this transformation. It\u2019s exciting. We\u2019re super happy to be part of it, part of this long-term journey. GamesBeat: Is there some sense of mission attached to that connected to Savvy? Ward: This is what really attracted me to this position and got me to move to Riyadh. I understood a bit about Vision 2030 and the economic diversification, social transformation aspect. But once I saw, once I visited for the first time and saw what that meant on the ground, I could see that this is kind of like China 35 years ago. The pace of change is astonishing. It seemed to be a unique opportunity to take part in something worthwhile. That\u2019s why I went there, and I think a lot of the people we\u2019ve hired and who have moved there are inspired by the same opportunity. GamesBeat: The flow of money into games, do you have any general observations about that? Is there some history to that flow? I just remember that when I joined VentureBeat 15 years ago, I thought I would stop covering games. There was a focus on venture capital for (tech), and there was (virtually) no venture capital for games. I thought I\u2019d end up covering tech more than games. But here we are 15 years later and GamesBeat is very big. Ward: You would know far more about this, but the level of engagement and the fan base and reach now of games, for those of us who\u2019ve been doing this almost 30 years \u2013 I remember thinking, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if we were eventually bigger than the music industry?\u201d Now we\u2019re bigger than those guys and the movies and somebody else put together. When you think about 3.2 billion people on the planet playing games on a regular basis, it\u2019s astonishing. GamesBeat: Saudi Arabia is also into building new cities and new structures. Do you have some sort of dream for that? How would building cities with games in mind happen? Ward: As you know, Vision 2030 encompasses all of those things. The giga-projects at NEOM and Qiddiya, which have significant \u2013 I mean, Qiddiya is essentially an entertainment-based city being built just west of Riyadh. We have a big part to play in the game section of that city. NEOM has a big games component to it as well. All these things are tied together under not only Vision 2030, but the national strategy for games and esports. Saudi, to my knowledge, is the only country on the planet that\u2019s announced a national strategy backed by the government for our sector. All of these things are interconnected in some pretty major ways. GamesBeat: The one hiccup that we\u2019ve seen lately is whether or not you were going to do the investment in Embracer. I don\u2019t know how you would signal to the rest of the market what that means. That particular deal is one that maybe wasn\u2019t going to happen. Is there any change in strategy? Ward: We don\u2019t have a change in our strategy. Our strategy has been consistent for the last two years. When we made our initial significant investment in Embracer, we had great faith in the leadership and the long-term strategic vision for Embracer. That hasn\u2019t changed either. We\u2019re very happy with our investment in Embracer over the long term. GamesBeat: The interest in doing large deals, is that still part of what you want? Ward: I think Scopely is the sixth-largest M&A deal in our industry\u2019s history. We\u2019re still interested, and we\u2019ve deployed maybe 25% of the capital designed to be allocated to us over the long term. We still have a significant part of our mandate to fulfill. GamesBeat: Do you have an interest in making sure you\u2019re not perceived as investing at valuations that are too high, or throwing too much money at your targets? Ward: We employ a lot of excellent and well-paid advisors to give us good opinions on these things. We trust the advice they give us. We think we\u2019ve done deals that have been very beneficial to Saudi and fair to both parties. If we looked at the transaction value on Scopely today we\u2019d be very pleased with how that\u2019s working out, given our mission. It\u2019s long term. People probably thought Amazon paying a billion dollars for Twitch was crazy at the time. GamesBeat: The good old days, when prices were low. For women in Saudi Arabia, do you feel like there are real opportunities for change for them? Ward: This is the thing that surprised me. I didn\u2019t have any personal knowledge or experience of the region. To see firsthand what was going on there in relation to opportunities for women, just generally speaking, was a real eye-opener. In a studio, which has nearly 80 people so far \u2013 this is a development studio. Almost 30% of that workforce are women. At any studio anywhere in the world that would be a pretty remarkable number. There\u2019s an equally high percentage of women in the Saudi workforce generally. It\u2019s exciting. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019m really happy about. When the Scopely guys came to visit, around the time of the closing, or just prior to the closing, we had a lunch for Scopely leadership and all of the local women employees in Saudi. The Scopely folks said they were blown away by the level of energy, enthusiasm, knowledge, and professionalism in that group. One of them said he wished he could bottle up that energy and take it back to California. GamesBeat: U.S. money has been going all over the world for decades. I suppose you could put an interpretation on that money. When China was also in the position of being able to finance a lot of the world, I think people wondered if they have a philosophy that also gets exported along with those investments in all those companies. Do they run these companies in a Chinese way? What is your own view as far as the next entity that really has the opportunity to invest all over the world? Is there a philosophy you\u2019d like to export, but also maybe one that stays at home in Saudi Arabia as well? Ward: There isn\u2019t a philosophy, other than we\u2019ve always intended to be and have been consistent in communicating this \u2013 we\u2019ve been given carte blanche to operate like a true games company, consistent with the values of our industry, what people consider to be important. That\u2019s been true. That was one thing I was pretty alive to when I first thought about the opportunity, because to your point, Chinese companies tend to operate \u2013 not all of them, but they tend to operate in a Chinese way. Western companies operate in a western way. But I can\u2019t say there\u2019s any defining set of values around being a Saudi games company. We\u2019re just trying to be a games company, period. GamesBeat: One interesting data point, maybe, that I was thinking about now. I wrote a profile on this guy named Amir Satvat who works for Amazon. He\u2019s kind of a quant. During the big layoffs that started happening in the fall, he started scraping all the game industry sites for job openings. He aggregated them into a spreadsheet on LinkedIn and made it available for everyone to look at. Here\u2019s all the jobs. He came up with 732 companies and 14,000 jobs that are open. The fun part was that he\u2019s noticed that for the last six weeks or so, that number has been steady. He sees that as a stabilization happening over a relatively short amount of time. Before that openings were tending to go down. Does that mean anything to you, that the collective number of jobs in the game industry is starting to go back up? Ward: I\u2019m not an expert by any stretch. I would anticipate that most of the post-COVID reconciliation of how many users there are, the engagement level and so forth has sorted itself out in terms of how many people we need to meet demand. We should start to be back to business as usual. That\u2019s what I would expect. GamesBeat: There\u2019s AI as well. Nobody knows what that\u2019s going to mean. I talked to a professor a few weeks ago who was saying that we could have a 10% boost to world GDP by 2032 with all the AI advances happening now. That\u2019s $11 trillion. That\u2019s happening. He thinks there\u2019s going to be more change in the next 10 years from AI than in the last 150 years of industrial revolution. One of his guys looked at a typical 2,000-person enterprise and found that jobs in that enterprise would probably be done with one-third to two-thirds fewer people. All these things seem to suggest we\u2019re about to be in another time of change. We thought there was change already in the last few decades, but there\u2019s more coming. Ward: But isn\u2019t that one of the best things about our industry, the constant change and development and evolution of it? I think AI is going to add a lot of jobs. There will be shifting in who does what. Did we need less artists when SpeedTree was introduced? No, we needed more. More tools mean more stuff gets done. That\u2019s the way I view it.

        "description": "'Metroid Fusion' on the GBA has long played second fiddle to the GameCube's 'Metroid Prime,' but it's a hugely satisfying experience in its own right.",
        "content": "Every bit as prime. In the early 2000s, selling two games at once became something of a trend. Blame it on , whose and sold approximately a bajillion copies. The only difference between the and versions was which you got, and the mandate to \u201ccatch \u2018em all\u201d made grabbing both irresistible. It was also a period of technological shift, as the second generation of 3D consoles became the unquestioned top dogs. But Pok\u00e9mon had shown that the consoles no longer had to operate alone. Games like had shown that big consoles like the N64 could operate in cohesion with their handheld siblings. But while some franchises had moved naturally into 3D, others struggled. Metroid had missed the N64 entirely, with the console coming and going without an entry. The game\u2019s shape-shifting exploration felt like it belonged to the 2D era. Plus, the fact that any developer would invite direct comparisons to an undisputed classic like made any potential game a tough mountain to climb. But climb a developer did, and suddenly in 2002 there were not one but two new Metroid games. There was the showstopper, the GameCube\u2019s . But there was also the side project, the second part of the one-two punch, the GameBoy Advance\u2019s , which is available right now if you\u2019ve subscribed to . Nintendo R&D1 didn\u2019t want to simply pay homage to . Samus\u2019s suit is visibly different from her iconic brown and yellow look, a difference that will matter in the game. After her adventures deep within the bowels of SR388 in , the planet\u2019s surface apparently offered up another nasty surprise for Samus: X parasites, macro-amoeba floating energy suckers. They almost kill Samus, if not for a vaccine made from cells of the infant Metroid that she had \u201cadopted\u201d in the 1994 game. The result is a new Samus, more Metroid than ever. The X parasites no longer affect her, and in fact can even help her, but she has new weaknesses, like the cold. Her suit, fused with both the baby Metroid and the X parasites, has turned bright blue. is a much more directed experience than , with a helpful map guiding the way. Perhaps more than any other gameplay mechanic, \u2019s biggest addition to the world of Metroid might be Navigation Centers, rooms in which Samus is very clearly told what to do and where to go. She\u2019s in a space station with only a computer for company, she names it Adam after a commander who respected her. Samus and Adam aren\u2019t exactly friendly, but there\u2019s a level of respect between them that feels earned. Samus notes in a cutscene that the real-life Adam was one of the few Space Marines who didn\u2019t see her gender as a joke. Taking orders from a computer, especially one as blunt as this one, chafes at her. But amidst her frustration, she\u2019d rather be taken seriously than as a joke. It would be too much to say that asks what it means to be a woman in the workplace, but the game offers some fascinating ideas even if it doesn\u2019t develop them fully. The parasites can give life just as they take it away, and are constantly seen flying around the space station rebuilding enemies that Samus has just turned into goo. To battle the endless enemies, Samus has her blaster, of course, and missiles. Missiles are crucial, with the ability to knock out tougher enemies and break up gross blockages. As the game moves forward, unveils its best trick: the only thing that can defeat Samus Aran is Samus Aran. Going from the hunter to the hunted is what has defined the series, and the innovations here helped the game rise above being on the B-tier, hidden behind a GameCube game. Now that it\u2019s on the big screen, it\u2019s time to play the game that inspired It\u2019s pretty thrilling in its own right.",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips For savvy investors, this hints at transportation giants focused on the movement of goods, especially those with tempting valuations. The post The 3 Best Transportation Stocks to Buy Now: September 2023 appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Transportation is a classic contender in the investment realm that often goes unnoticed. It might not have the glitz of newer sectors, but it stitches together over 5% of the U.S. GDP, translating to $1.3 trillion annually . For savvy investors, the search for the best transportation stocks begins here, blending tradition with tremendous potential. Moreover, even in the face of economic drizzles, some transportation companies sail smoothly, showing us their tenacity. While the broader stock market might occasionally catch a cold, those in the know are spotting golden opportunities. Among those are transportation stocks with rock-solid foundations. Furthermore, shopping sprees are set for a comeback as consumers\u2019 wanderlust for experiences settles down. For savvy investors, this hints at transportation giants focused on the movement of goods, especially those with tempting valuations. So, buckle up as we journey through three transportation stocks poised for a rewarding ride. Uber ( UBER ) Uber (NYSE: UBER ) has revved up to become the poster child of disruptive innovation. Displacing traditional taxis and pioneering the ride-sharing movement, Uber has effectively reshaped the dynamics of city transportation. But Uber didn\u2019t just stop at dropping you off at your destinations. Their progressive business plan brings food to your doorstep with Uber Eats. To go a mile further, they have revamped logistics with Uber Freight and Uber Business. The recent financial figures only underscore its relentless drive forward. Though its Q2 revenue of $9.23 billion narrowly missed projections, its net income of $394 million (or 18 cents per share) stole the show. In contrast was a staggering loss of $2.6 billion for the same quarter. It reported its first-ever quarterly operating profit of $326 million, along with a roaring free cash flow growth to $1.14 billion. This represents a near 200% bump from the prior year. Now, while it may not be rubbing shoulders with the elites in the S&P 500 just yet, the winds suggest it\u2019s prepping its grand entrance. Given its solid performances, it\u2019s undeniably one of the season\u2019s most unexpected yet delightful surprises. Canadian National Railway ( CNI ) Canadian National Railway (NYSE: CNI ) stands out as a robust pillar in the North American railroad landscape, bridging key territories across Canada and the midwestern U.S. Over the past decade, it has proven to be an excellent wealth compounder, delighting shareholders with a substantial 126% bump in its share price. It recently posted mixed earnings in its second-quarter, locking revenues at 4.06 billion CAD and grappling with an 8% drop in earnings-per-share compared to the prior year. However, the quarter was marred by a confluence of Canadian wildfires and economic ripples, viewed as transient clouds on CNI\u2019s horizon. Nevertheless, it still posted a budding 10% uptick in free cash flow, a testament to the company\u2019s resiliency. As we shift our gaze to the future, CNI holds a buoyant vision, forecasting potent growth between 10% to 15% in long-term earnings per share. Moreover, it promises 14.4% upside and a comforting 2.07% dividend yield. Boeing Co. ( BA ) Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA ), a titan in aerospace, is soaring to new heights. The aviation behemoth is renowned for its cutting-edge commercial jets and formidable defense systems. It posted an impressive Q2 revenue of $19.75 billion, eclipsing the projected $18.57 billion. This uptick can be credited to various factors, chiefly the resurgence in passenger traffic across the U.S., Europe, and Asia in the post-pandemic era. Furthermore, despite the headwinds stemming from supply chain hiccups and the recent blip around the Boeing 737 MAX, the company\u2019s trajectory remains skyward. A testament to this is the 12% jump in deliveries and a healthy 41% surge in revenues during its second-quarter.

        "description": "Post-pandemic college tours are back and in high demand. Here\u2019s how to navigate the fall visiting season.",
        "content": "T he price of gas is rising. Air travel is a mess. But this fall, many college-bound high school seniors and their parents will spend days\u2014sometimes happily, sometimes not\u2014exploring far flung campuses. They may ask blunt questions of undergraduate guides; wander through dorms where the students aren\u2019t yet dressed; listen to lectures (if they get there on a weekday); snap touristy selfies with scenic views (at parents\u2019 insistence); or find that tours at the schools highest on their lists are already booked up, at least for fall weekends. While college visits done right (see the tips below) are still a valuable way to determine whether an institution is the right fit, taking an official tour of Princeton , Yale , Stanford , or Harvard won\u2019t earn you any points with the admissions office. Yes, many colleges do still consider what is called \u201cdemonstrated interest\u201d\u2014how eager a given applicant appears to be to attend the school\u2014in their admissions decisions. And historically, taking the tour was a good way to show interest. But today, no members of the Ivy League and none of the top 15 schools on Forbes\u2019 2023 America\u2019s Top Colleges even consider applicants\u2019 interest as a factor in admissions. Looking at the top 100 on the new Forbes list, only 48% of private schools and 23% of public schools take demonstrated interest into account, according to the latest information they\u2019ve provided to what\u2019s known as the Common Data Set. By contrast, 81% of those same private colleges (including all eight Ivies) consider legacy status \u2014meaning whether an applicant is the child of a graduate, and particularly a wealthy one who might be or become a donor. (Among state schools in the top 100, only 27% consider legacy.) Moreover, even those admissions officers who care about demonstrated interest measure it by a lot more than just who schleps to campus. They count interactions at college fairs and high school visits and how many times the student contacts the admissions office. And, like any good marketer, they track open rates and click through rates on emails. Then there\u2019s the University of Michigan (the highest ranked public college on the Forbes list that\u2019s outside of California ). It doesn\u2019t track clicks or visits, but factors in a student\u2019s interest based on how they respond to an essay question asking what attracts them to the program they\u2019re applying to, reports Kelly Cox, senior associate director of recruitment and operations with the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Rice University in Houston does the same. Giving extra points for a college visit has fallen out of favor for several reasons. One is equity (though that doesn\u2019t seem to have killed legacy preference). Not everyone can afford a cross-country flight or weekend road trip to visit campus, says Jaime Soto, senior associate director of admissions for recruitment and communications at the University of Washington . Another reason is volume, he says. UWash, which received more than 55,000 applications across its three campuses for the 2020-21 academic year, doesn\u2019t have the time or resources to track the engagement habits of all of those applicants. This is a widespread problem: With more colleges using a common application form and going test-optional, high school seniors aiming for college are each applying to more schools. In 2022, according to Common App data , the average student put in 6.2 college applications, up from 4.6 in 2014. Finally, there\u2019s the enduring impact of the Covid-19 pandemic\u2014a time when colleges temporarily canceled in-person classes along with applicant visits, and beefed up their online campus tours. Kevin Donohue, assistant director of admissions at Dartmouth College and a 2021 grad, gave live virtual tours during the pandemic\u2014as an undergraduate, he\u2019d walk around campus with a gliding camera and answer questions that viewers submitted through a chatbox. One student loved the experience so much he attended Donohue\u2019s tour three times, he reports. Most schools have retained these virtual offerings. So why do parents and students bother coming to campus? Because it really does affect students\u2019 decisions. A fall visit is particularly important if a student is going to apply to a school for early decision. Under the rules, if a student is admitted through early decision and receives adequate financial aid, they are required to commit to that school and withdraw their applications from any others. (This differs from early action, where students apply and receive a decision ahead of time but do not need to commit to the school.) Donohue offers his first, junior year visit to Dartmouth as an object lesson. \u201cIt was a rainy April day. It was just miserable out \u2026 and I remember just loving it.\u201d At lunch he told his mom he was going to Dartmouth and applied early decision the next fall. \u201cThe joke that we make in college admissions is that if you visit a campus on a less than ideal weather day and fall in love, it means you found your home,\u2019\u2019 echoes Jennifer Ziegenfus, assistant vice chancellor for admissions at the University of Colorado, Boulder . Ziegenfus notes touring parents can sometimes seem more enthusiastic than their kids\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean the students aren\u2019t influenced. The tour starting point at her campus is a statue of a mascot buffalo (Ralphie, he\u2019s called) framed by the Rocky Mountains. \u201cThe picture is one of the most iconic photos you can take on the entire campus. I have seen family members take a photo and the students be extremely resistant to taking the photo because they were essentially dragged to the visit,\u201d she says. \u201cThey might be coming from across the country or right down the street, and mom and dad make them take this photo.\u2019\u2019 Later, she adds, some of those same students become graduates with a different attitude. \u201cThey take this iconic photo, they keep it on their phone, and then years later they come back to show us.\u201d Embarrassing selfies aren\u2019t the only potentially problematic dynamic involving parents. Michigan\u2019s Cox notes it can be less than ideal \u201cwhen the parent is an alumnus of the institution and they\u2019re excited to be back and they had a positive experience and are hoping to share. They can take over the tour a bit and not leave it to the tour guide.\u201d There\u2019s also the game day visit, \u201cif there\u2019s tailgates and you see some activity on a Saturday morning from students pregaming so to speak.\u2019\u2019 (That, for you parents, means drinking in advance of a game.) \u201cParents may look at that and think, \u2018Oh, I dunno if this is really what we want for our students. And on the other hand, students might be looking at that thinking, \u2018Wow, this is awesome,\u2019\u201d he says. Then there\u2019s the issue of coordinating dorm tours. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of reports back from our guys where they got there, entered the room and surprised some people who either are still in bed or not fully dressed for the day, and there\u2019s a group of 15 strangers walking in\u201d says Cox. \u201cIt\u2019s part of working with college students early in the weekend morning.\u201d N ow that campus visits are back in vogue, the biggest issue may just be getting all the tour slots you want. Between their twin sons and 13-month-younger daughter, Greg Tole and his wife Tosia of Denville, New Jersey, have three children who will be starting college next fall. During their 2023 spring break, Tole took his sons to visit schools in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia, while his wife did a separate swing with their daughter. \u201cI prefer that my kids view quite a few schools because I think there\u2019s a certain vibe that you can get that\u2019s either going to be really appealing, or not,\u201d Tole says. Their efforts to plan the perfect trips were thwarted, however, when he realized that openings at several of their target colleges were already full. Tole couldn\u2019t get a guided tour at Clemson University or James Madison University, and his wife couldn\u2019t snag a time at the University of Georgia. Indeed, though the admissions cycle for fall 2024 has only just begun, listed weekend tour dates at some highly selective colleges are already booked. At Harvard University, currently scheduled tours run through mid-November, and all weekend slots are filled. At Princeton, weekend tours are booked through October. (Early action applications are due by November 1 at both those Ivies.) If you\u2019re keen on a tour, but all of the available times are booked, admissions officials suggest calling their offices\u2014it\u2019s possible the school might add additional time slots or keep a waitlist. (CU Boulder\u2019s Ziegenfus also suggests clicking on a full date online, because that sometimes takes you to the sign-up page for the wait list.) One tool Tole found helpful in his planning: College Scoops, an online service that for $99 a year (or $9.95 a month), offers virtual guidebooks to 101 colleges, designed to be useful to both parents and students. There are hotel recommendations, lists of nearby restaurants, interactive maps, links to register for guided campus tours and self-guided trip itineraries for each campus. Moira McCullough, an Osterville, Massachusetts, mother of three, says she launched the service in 2019 because her first college visit with her oldest son was a disappointment. \u201cI was so excited to get one kid in the car, drive six hours, learn everything I can about my son\u2014all his desires and what he wanted to be and what he wanted to study,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it was an absolute disaster.\u201d What her son wanted was \u201cthe experience of a dress rehearsal,\u201d she says. Instead, \u201che walked away from that visit thinking \u2018This is where I\u2019m going to live, learn and grow, and all I learned was what I had read about on the website and the brochures.\u2019\u201d So College Scoops offers answers from current undergraduates to such real life questions as where they eat, workout, party and park their cars, enabling kids considering a school to check out where they\u2019ll actually spend time\u2014beyond the classrooms and what\u2019s in the glossy, admission-office produced brochure.",

Serbia vs. Germany FIBA World Cup Odds *Odds taken from FanDuel on Friday, September 8. When, Where, and How to Watch? Germany Coming Off a Win Over Team US The United States men\u2019s national basketball team was the No. 1 favorite to win the 2023 FIBA World Cup before the start of the tournament. Until Friday, it seemed as if the bookies were right to favor the Americans. But then, Team US lost to Germany 113-111. It was a close win for the Germans especially after Team US players switched to the top gear in the final couple of minutes of the game. But Germany was able to survive, mostly thanks to its players\u2019 brilliant offensive output. GERMANY STUN USA TO GO TO THE WORLD CUP FINAL. Truth be told, the Americans didn\u2019t seem too interested in the defense, which allowed Germany to score so many points. In fact, 113 points is the most these guys have scored in a game since 2014 when they beat Luxemburg 118-66. Should you expect the Germans to continue their offensive brilliance and score as many points in the 2023 FIBA World Cup? Not really. After all, they\u2019re playing against a team with arguably the most disciplined defense in the world. Svetislav Pesic Preparing Another Basketball Masterclass When you think of Serbian basketball, your mind probably goes straight to . But \u201cJoker\u201d isn\u2019t with the Serbia national team in the Philippines. Instead, this team\u2019s biggest star is , who\u2019s been getting limited time on the court in the NBA as an Atlanta Hawks shooting guard.

This isn\u2019t surprising given that the team is coached by , a 74-year-old coach who won a World Cup in 2002 while at the helm of former Yugoslavia. After winning the 2002 World Cup in Indianapolis, Pesic coached a number of elite European clubs, including Bayern Munich, where he stayed for nearly four years. Further, at one point in his career, he was even the head coach of the Germany national basketball team. 2023 FIBA World Cup Final Prediction With Pesic as their coach, the Serbs have every right to hope for a good result on Sunday. If there\u2019s a man who can prepare a strategy needed to beat the Germans in the final, it\u2019s him. Plus, you can be 100% certain that his boys are going to give everything on the court of the Mall of Asia Arena. It\u2019s not just about becoming the champions of the world, it\u2019s also about making their struggling friend happy. What we\u2019re talking about is that the Serbs want to win the FIBA World Cup for their teammate Borisa Simanic who suffered such a horrible injury in Serbia\u2019s game against South Sudan that doctors had to remove his kidney. : Serbia to win",

        "content": "When it comes to quick home improvements, we asked the experts. Maintaining a home is not only expensive but also requires strong attention to detail. From the upkeep of fresh paint to decluttering your space, there are a ton of surprising ways to elevate your home on a budget. And, who better to give us home advice than expert contractors with years of professional experience? Ahead, you\u2019ll learn incredible tips and home hacks that will prevent your home from looking cheap and outdated. Keep scrolling to discover 30 minor things that make a big impact when you want to take your humble abode to the next level. 01 Removing brass outlet covers Bill Samuel, a residential real estate developer at , suggests staying clear of brass materials in your home. \"If you have any brass hardware in your house, this will make your space look dated and cheap,\u201d he explains. \u201cBrass hardware was a common builder-grade finish back in the \u201880s and \u201890s so people typically associate this style as old and cheap. Swapping out this hardware for newer modern looking hardware will give your living area a more modern and custom appearance.\" Available in a set of two in either matte black or white, these will give a modern finish to your wall. They come with all of the necessary mounting screws for an easy installation. 02 Using bright outlet covers for a cleaner appearance \"Older outlets that are almond colored or painted over can make your living room look cheap as well,\u201d says Samuel. Pick up this white that\u2019s earned a 4.7-star rating on Amazon and will achieve a clean fresh look throughout your home. \u201cMake sure your outlets/switches/covers are paint free and bright white to give your living room space a clean finished look,\u201d he continues. 03 Adding skirting boards & trim Joe Ferguson, Architectural Joiner at , recommends adding baseboard trims for a quick and easy way to elevate your walls. \"Skirting boards and trim [are] the best way to fix awkward terminations and can help soften the look of a room. Best used between ceiling and walls to blur termination,\u201d says Ferguson. This is super easy to install. After you measure your wall, simply cut the flexible adhesive to your desired length and stick it on. It also makes for an affordable solution to mask cracks and damaged corners. \u201cTrims can also be used to add accentuate door jambs as well as decorate furniture and hide imperfections,\u201d he adds. 04 Replacing your mailbox Shlomo Cherniak, contractor and owner of , told Mic, \u201cSomething I've done a lot, replace the mailbox. It's inexpensive and simple to do.\u201d This from Amazon comes with a customizable address kit that includes over 70 matching vinyl numbers. The numbers can be mounted vertically or horizontally. \u201cIf your mailbox is near the road, people passing by notice it. If it's on your house, it adds to the curb appeal of your front entry. Over time, your mailbox starts looking a bit rough. Or worse, it looks like it's about to fall off the post. Replacing with a new more decorative mailbox is an easy home fix,\u201d he explains. 05 Fixing leaky faucets Kamil Kowalski, President of , recommends buying to easily fix a leaky faucet. \"Leaky faucets can often be fixed with a simple washer change. If your faucet is dripping, it\u2019s likely the washer has worn out and needs to be replaced. Do-it-yourselfers can quickly replace the washer and be done with this easy fix in a matter of minutes,\u201d says Kowalski. This pack from Amazon comes with 58 pieces that include everything you need to fix your faucet. From flat and beveled washers to a variety of brass screws, you\u2019ll be set. 06 Replacing your lightbulbs David Nicholas, an electrician at , loves these that give off a retro-warm light to create a cozy ambiance. Nicholas explains, \"As a professional electrician, in my opinion, one of the simplest fixes homeowners can do is change out their standard lightbulbs for the modern Edison type that prominently displays the filament.\u201d \u201cThese bulbs are common in high-end bars and restaurants as they produce a warm glow that is less harsh on the eyes than traditional LEDs and help create a relaxing environment,\u201d he continues. \u201cHarsh LED lighting also has the negative effect of highlighting imperfections on the walls and ceilings, which these Edison-style bulbs overcome\u201d 07 Re-painting your walls Painting your walls is no easy feat, but the best place to start is by making sure you have all of the right tools. For instance, these are a must for protecting your floors and furniture from paint. As Bruce Rodriguez, the owner of , explains, \"Many people think that painting is a simple task, but there are actually quite a few things to consider before starting a paint job.

This is the best alternative to spackling and works best for big damages like large cracks and holes. \u201cBest of all though? It\u2019s easy to use and you don\u2019t need to be a pro to use it to mend cracking,\u201d says Chambers. 13 Patching up drafty spots Chambers also says he\u2019s a \u201cbig fan of draft excluders and window sealants because even professionally fitted windows and doors can let a draft in, and out, adding a zero or two to your heating bills over time.

The adhesive can easily be applied to any surface without damaging your walls, easily transforming your space. 20 Opting for better window treatments Kropovinsky also added, \"Don't use vinyl blinds as window treatments.

Replacing fixtures is also a great way to update both the aesthetic and function of your bathroom in a minimally invasive way.\u201d Gafagna explains, \u201cNot only is it simple to install a new faucet yourself, but the cost of purchasing a faucet is a lot cheaper than replacing the entire sink or vanity.

        "content": "Casualties surge as tremor leads to several buildings collapsing in the Unesco World Heritage site At least 632 people have died and 329 injured in Morocco after an earthquake struck near the historic Marrakech city, according to state-run television. The death toll has surged from the initial 296 figure that was reported by the interior ministry earlier today. The tremor struck late Friday night and had an initial 6.8 magnitude when it hit at 11.11pm local time, with shaking that lasted several seconds. Morocco's National Seismic Monitoring and Alert Network, however, said the earthqauke struck at a magnitude of 7.2 on the Richter scale. The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Ighil area of the High Atlas mountains, said the agency. A 4.9-magnitude aftershock was reported just 19 minutes after the earthquake, according to the US Geological Survey. Most of the deaths have occurred in mountainous areas that are hard to reach, the interior ministry said earlier. Videos have emerged of several buildings being reduced to rubble and have left parts of the famous red walls in Marrakech damaged. Some buildings in the old city, a Unesco World Heritage site, with photos of smashed cars and rubble all over emerging.

        "description": "Week Ahead 11th-15th SeptemberMON: Norwegian CPI (Aug)TUE: EIA STEO, OPEC MOMR; Swedish Unemployment (Aug), UK Unemployment (Aug) & Wages (Jul), NorwegianGDP (Jul), Germany/EZ ZEW (Sep)WED: IEA OMR; UK GDP Estimate (Jul), US CPI (Aug)THU: ECB Policy Announcement, Norges Bank Regional Network; Australian Employment (Aug), Swedish CPIF (Aug),US Retail Sales (Aug), IJC (w/e 4th Sep), New Zealand Manufacturing PMI (Aug)FRI: Quad Witching, CBR Policy Announcement, ECB TLTRO Repayment Publication; Chinese Industrial Output/Production, Retail Sales, House Prices (Aug), EZ Trade Balance (Jul), US Export/Import Prices (Aug), IndustrialProduction (Aug), NY Fed Manufacturing (Sep), Uni. of Michigan Prelim. (Sep)NOTE: Previews are listed in day orderNORWEGIAN CPI (MON): The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced.UK UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES (TUE): Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end.UK GDP ESTIMATE (WED): A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought.US CPI (WED): Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern.ECB ANNOUNCEMENT (THU): 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%.AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYMENT (THU): participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms.SWEDISH CPIF (THU): July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak.US RETAIL SALES (THU): Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July. While the data set will offer a glimpse on the health of the consumer amid concerns that the economy may slow significantly in the months ahead, traders will also be watching the University of Michigan's prelim survey release due Friday, where the rise in energy prices is likely to have weighed on sentiment.CHINESE ACTIVITY DATA (FRI): Retail sales Y/Y in August are expected to rise by 2.8% (prev. 2.5%), whilst there is currently no consensus for Industrial Production metrics. The data will be closely watched to diagnose the health of the world\u2019s second-larger economy and to gauge the drip-feed of stimulus seen over recent weeks. Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d.This article originally appeared on Newsquawk This article was written by Newsquawk Analysis at www.forexlive.com.",

Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought. : Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern. : 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%. : participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms. : July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak. : Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July. While the data set will offer a glimpse on the health of the consumer amid concerns that the economy may slow significantly in the months ahead, traders will also be watching the University of Michigan's prelim survey release due Friday, where the rise in energy prices is likely to have weighed on sentiment. : Retail sales Y/Y in August are expected to rise by 2.8% (prev. 2.5%), whilst there is currently no consensus for Industrial Production metrics. The data will be closely watched to diagnose the health of the world\u2019s second-larger economy and to gauge the drip-feed of stimulus seen over recent weeks. Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d. This article originally appeared on",

This was a summit for a coalition known as \"BRICS.\" It's named after the original countries that founded the group in 2009: Brazil, Russia, India, and China. South Africa was added to the group in 2010. The recent summit put the bloc in the spotlight by announcing six new members that will join the BRICS group on January 1st: Argentina, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. Currently, the countries in the G7, including the United States, represent 10% of the world's population and roughly 42% of its GDP. By some estimates , the BRICS nations currently represent about 40% of the world's population and roughly a quarter of its GDP. Once the largest oil-producing nations join the bloc next year, its collective economic clout is expected to climb even more. Reactions from Western observers are mixed, with some playing down the potential for any economic or political rivalry with the group. For example, former U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton told CNBC it was not a particular concern. \"I don't think they constitute a serious challenge at this point because the biggest economy of the group, China, is itself now going into a period of potential real trouble,\" said Bolton. Underscoring the potential for political infighting, Russian President Vladimir Putin attended the summit virtually because the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant against him for alleged war crimes in Ukraine. South Africa, as a signatory to the ICC treaty, would have been obligated to arrest Putin had he landed on its territory.

In Africa, China has also made significant inroads by building infrastructure and growing its influence across the continent\u2014accomplishments that Chinese President Xi Jinping highlighted at the summit. \"Over the past decade, China has provided a large number of development assistance to Africa and has helped build more than 6,000 kilometers of railway, more than 6,000 kilometers of highway, and 80-plus large power facilities on the continent,\" Xi said. China alone has overtaken the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as the world's largest creditor, lending hundreds of billions of dollars across the globe. One of the central appeals of the BRICS group is its \"New Development Bank,\" intended to be an alternative lending option to the IMF and World Bank.

        "description": "Brian Ward, CEO of Savvy Gaming Group, is trying to change Saudi Arabia's reputation by leading its investments in gaming.",
        "content": "We're thrilled to announce the return of GamesBeat Next, hosted in San Francisco this October, where we will explore the theme of \"Playing the Edge.\" Apply to speak here and learn more about sponsorship opportunities here. At the event, we will also announce 25 top game startups as the 2024 Game Changers. Apply or nominate today ! Brian Ward, CEO of Savvy Games Group , has taken the lead in helping Saudi Arabia\u2019s attempt to move beyond its reputation for human rights abuses and being an oil nation to being a visionary technology leader bankrolling the game industry. This tension between the past and the future is ever-present in Saudi Arabia, where companies like Savvy Games Group \u2014 owned by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia \u2014 are trying to change perceptions through games while remaining cognizant of the kingdom\u2019s appetite for measured change. Ward believes people have to see the change happening in society on the ground in Saudi Arabia in order to understand how quickly things can happen under the new regime that is mostly supportive of the game industry. There is perhaps no other country where the clash between tradition and modernity \u2014 something my world history professor talked about so long ago \u2014 is so stark. The change and the deals have been happening at a dizzying rate. It\u2019s like a big game of Monopoly, and the playing board of the game industry is set up on a global scale. Savvy Games Group acquired Los Angeles-based mobile game publisher Scopely for $4.9 billion in April, and it bought a $1 billion stake in Sweden-based game publisher Embracer Group. It also acquired ESL Gaming and FaceIt in esports to create ESL FaceIt Group. And the Saudis have also bought stakes in Capcom, Nexon and Nintendo this year, building on stakes it acquired previously in Activision Blizzard, Take-Two Interactive and Electronic Arts. That has made the gaming world take notice. Savvy\u2019s big stakeholder, the Public Investment Fund (run by the Saudi Arabian government) is flush with cash from the oil boom and it has set aside $37.8 billion to build up Saudi Arabia\u2019s presence in the global games industry \u2013 with $13.3 billion of that earmarked for acquiring a major publisher. That\u2019s more money than anyone around the world is earmarking for gaming investments and acquisitions. It\u2019s a sign that the government is serious about weaning the country from oil. The Saudi Vision 2030 is a government program launched by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to diversify economically, socially and culturally, in line with the vision of bin Salman. The Saudis announced it in 2016, but the country remained about 74% dependent on oil exports as of 2021. The country understands that the oil economy could dry up in the next 27 years, and it has to have other jobs ready \u2014 and they are trickling in so far. For the games industry, this influx of Saudi money into games is not without controversy, as the Saudi funding is controversial and the company has only been at it since November 2021. Critics say that the regime of Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud doesn\u2019t respect human rights. As crown prince and prime minister, he was connected to the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 via alleged killers who had ties to the crown prince. Accepting funding from the Saudis under such a regime represents a moral quandary, as the Saudis have become a big source of funding in their efforts to diversify beyond their dependence on oil, which the world is in the process of moving away from in pursuit of clean energy. Saudi defenders say that all major sources of money in the world are tainted in some way, and accepting money from the Saudis does not mean you have to accept interference from the Saudis or embrace their agenda. Ward pointed out in an interview with GamesBeat that the country is undergoing change when it comes to women\u2019s rights and other freedoms, and it is serious about creating transformative results when it comes to diversity and new jobs associated with game studios. Still, given the fact that being gay is illegal in Saudi Arabia, The Last of Us Part 2 was banned in the country for having gay women in its leading roles. Ward has said the company aims to become a great games company and is not tied to a specific political agenda and he is not there for an \u201cimage makeover project.\u201d While change may be happening, it\u2019s not happening fast enough for critics. I caught up with Ward in an interview at the company\u2019s booth at the Gamescom expo in Cologne, Germany. Here\u2019s an edited transcript of our interview. Brian Ward: Sorry I wasn\u2019t able to meet before. GamesBeat: You guys were busy buying somebody. Brian Ward: That was a hectic time. GamesBeat: How are things going since then? Especially with acquiring Scopely. Ward: Very good. We\u2019re obviously delighted to have closed the transaction with Scopely. Their Monopoly Go product is fantastic. It\u2019s doing very well. The people are working super hard on integration. They\u2019ve been a pleasure to work with in that regard. So far we\u2019re delighted. GamesBeat: On things like esports, I wonder how much focus you have on MENA (Middle East/North Africa) versus the wider world. Ward: We\u2019re pretty globally focused. The live attendance on all the majors this year has been up. The viewership, the hours watched have been up. There have been some hiccups in the sector generally with publisher spend on esports this year, but overall the business has been doing great. We\u2019re focused on MENA, of course. The EFG folks are in the middle of executing on Gamers8. There are plans for that tournament to be bigger and more robust next year. There\u2019s a lot going on. The conference next week will be a good one. GamesBeat: Is that a first for them, or have they been doing them before? Ward: This is the second version of Next World Forum. Gamers8 started during COVID as Gamers Without Borders, for charity relief. This is the second version of both the G8 and the NWF. GamesBeat: Is there a feeling of progress as you come out of COVID? Esports had to take some huge hits during that time. It transformed a lot as well. Ward: I think we\u2019re beyond COVID. The capital markets, the economic situation last year and coming into this year, caused some publishers to pull back on their esports spend, which affected a couple of pieces of the business, but overall attendance is up. Viewership is up. There seems to be as much engagement as there was before from a fan point of view. GamesBeat: For Saudi gamers and Saudi esports fans, how would you describe the market? Ward: When we invested in EFG, it seemed that coming out of COVID \u2013 that was nearly two years ago now \u2013 it was an inflection point where engagement had changed or accelerated because of COVID, and there would be some consolidation in esports. There would be some dynamics that would sort themselves out, whether it\u2019s the relationship between players and teams and publishers and where the power base really sits. A lot of that still has to get sorted out. Team economics are not universally great. GamesBeat: The game industry itself, where do you see the trends developing? Ward: We\u2019re super excited, especially on the heels of closing Scopely. We\u2019re excited about mobile-first cross-platform opportunities. Scopely is also making great progress in direct payments. That\u2019s an interesting economic lever for us. For Savvy, we now have a great anchor in mobile. We\u2019re looking forward to figuring out how we can facilitate, like we\u2019re doing with Scopely, some partners in PC and console. GamesBeat: You\u2019re still looking around for opportunities? Ward: This year we haven\u2019t been looking at as many opportunities. We\u2019ve been focused internally on making sure we have the right leadership team in place. Scopely is a big acquisition. The integration is fairly involved. We\u2019re focused on making sure that we\u2019re putting some investment professionals in place, so we don\u2019t rely on external advisors as much. We\u2019re focused internally on our structure and governance and operating model, more so than looking for additional investments. GamesBeat: Were there some things that made you think that the period in which you were buying assets there \u2013 was that fortuitous in some ways? When there are downturns in the economy, prices for acquisitions are lower. It\u2019s a good time to buy. Did that matter to you? If you have strategic imperatives to move into a business fast, you probably don\u2019t care as much about the economic situation. Ward: That\u2019s true. It\u2019s very difficult to time the market. It\u2019s been fortuitous that valuations have come off a bit and those people with capital to employ have been in a market where it\u2019s been more difficult for people to find as many varied sources of capital as there were two years ago. That\u2019s advantageous to us. But we haven\u2019t pulled on that lever very hard. This year we\u2019ve been focused more internally. GamesBeat: For games it seems like there was a lot of pressure on valuations, after some very big excitement in 2021. Everybody thought that usage was going to go up forever. Is there a level-setting that you see that still reflects favorable trends? Ward: Overall, I think the trends are super favorable for the long term. We don\u2019t get too excited about this year versus last year or 2022 versus COVID. Long term we think this is probably the best entertainment business to be in. Yes, there\u2019s some sort of reconciliation. Figuring out where usage and engagement will land after COVID. But that will settle. GamesBeat: I listened to Take-Two\u2019s earnings call. It was interesting to hear Strauss Zelnick answer a question about games and Hollywood, all the synergy happening right now. Someone asked why they aren\u2019t doing more of that. He said, \u201cWe came from movies. It was a very hard business. There were many failures.\u201d For years everyone saw that the big opportunity was in games, so why would they go back in a big way? Although he did say that they\u2019re working on a Borderlands movie and some other projects. They\u2019re participating in that. But he felt like it was a no-brainer that gaming is still the more interesting business. Ward: It\u2019s kind of the flip side of the trend from 20 years ago, where movies became games. Now it\u2019s games becoming movies. GamesBeat: Do you think about that as an opportunity as well? Ward: Not yet. We\u2019re not focused on that at the moment. I still view us as a startup. We have maybe a couple hundred people in Saudi Arabia and 4,000 worldwide. We still have a lot of things to do in terms of building a games business. We have a pretty good esports business. GamesBeat: Are you focused on building a larger local staff? Ward: Very much so. The studio, which is now renamed Steer Studios, has done a super job. They now have about 80 people on two or three mobile teams, and 80% of them are Saudis. We\u2019re highly focused and highly incentivized against building out the local ecosystem. GamesBeat: How does that mix in with the Scopely business? Is it alongside Scopely? Ward: Scopely is very interested in the MENA region and expanding beyond their traditional markets. We expect that they\u2019ll be looking at opportunities in MENA and Saudi specifically. GamesBeat: How do you look back after some years on the issues around human rights that people have had with Saudi Arabia, whether or not they want to do business there? How is that turning out? Ward: My standard answer to this, or part of my standard answer, is for folks to take the time to understand what\u2019s going on there and how far this social transformation and economic diversification project is coming in the last five years. A tremendous amount of progress has been made toward Vision 2030 and all of this transformation. It\u2019s exciting. We\u2019re super happy to be part of it, part of this long-term journey. GamesBeat: Is there some sense of mission attached to that connected to Savvy? Ward: This is what really attracted me to this position and got me to move to Riyadh. I understood a bit about Vision 2030 and the economic diversification, social transformation aspect. But once I saw, once I visited for the first time and saw what that meant on the ground, I could see that this is kind of like China 35 years ago. The pace of change is astonishing. It seemed to be a unique opportunity to take part in something worthwhile. That\u2019s why I went there, and I think a lot of the people we\u2019ve hired and who have moved there are inspired by the same opportunity. GamesBeat: The flow of money into games, do you have any general observations about that? Is there some history to that flow? I just remember that when I joined VentureBeat 15 years ago, I thought I would stop covering games. There was a focus on venture capital for (tech), and there was (virtually) no venture capital for games. I thought I\u2019d end up covering tech more than games. But here we are 15 years later and GamesBeat is very big. Ward: You would know far more about this, but the level of engagement and the fan base and reach now of games, for those of us who\u2019ve been doing this almost 30 years \u2013 I remember thinking, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if we were eventually bigger than the music industry?\u201d Now we\u2019re bigger than those guys and the movies and somebody else put together. When you think about 3.2 billion people on the planet playing games on a regular basis, it\u2019s astonishing. GamesBeat: Saudi Arabia is also into building new cities and new structures. Do you have some sort of dream for that? How would building cities with games in mind happen? Ward: As you know, Vision 2030 encompasses all of those things. The giga-projects at NEOM and Qiddiya, which have significant \u2013 I mean, Qiddiya is essentially an entertainment-based city being built just west of Riyadh. We have a big part to play in the game section of that city. NEOM has a big games component to it as well. All these things are tied together under not only Vision 2030, but the national strategy for games and esports. Saudi, to my knowledge, is the only country on the planet that\u2019s announced a national strategy backed by the government for our sector. All of these things are interconnected in some pretty major ways. GamesBeat: The one hiccup that we\u2019ve seen lately is whether or not you were going to do the investment in Embracer. I don\u2019t know how you would signal to the rest of the market what that means. That particular deal is one that maybe wasn\u2019t going to happen. Is there any change in strategy? Ward: We don\u2019t have a change in our strategy. Our strategy has been consistent for the last two years. When we made our initial significant investment in Embracer, we had great faith in the leadership and the long-term strategic vision for Embracer. That hasn\u2019t changed either. We\u2019re very happy with our investment in Embracer over the long term. GamesBeat: The interest in doing large deals, is that still part of what you want? Ward: I think Scopely is the sixth-largest M&A deal in our industry\u2019s history. We\u2019re still interested, and we\u2019ve deployed maybe 25% of the capital designed to be allocated to us over the long term. We still have a significant part of our mandate to fulfill. GamesBeat: Do you have an interest in making sure you\u2019re not perceived as investing at valuations that are too high, or throwing too much money at your targets? Ward: We employ a lot of excellent and well-paid advisors to give us good opinions on these things. We trust the advice they give us. We think we\u2019ve done deals that have been very beneficial to Saudi and fair to both parties. If we looked at the transaction value on Scopely today we\u2019d be very pleased with how that\u2019s working out, given our mission. It\u2019s long term. People probably thought Amazon paying a billion dollars for Twitch was crazy at the time. GamesBeat: The good old days, when prices were low. For women in Saudi Arabia, do you feel like there are real opportunities for change for them? Ward: This is the thing that surprised me. I didn\u2019t have any personal knowledge or experience of the region. To see firsthand what was going on there in relation to opportunities for women, just generally speaking, was a real eye-opener. In a studio, which has nearly 80 people so far \u2013 this is a development studio. Almost 30% of that workforce are women. At any studio anywhere in the world that would be a pretty remarkable number. There\u2019s an equally high percentage of women in the Saudi workforce generally. It\u2019s exciting. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019m really happy about. When the Scopely guys came to visit, around the time of the closing, or just prior to the closing, we had a lunch for Scopely leadership and all of the local women employees in Saudi. The Scopely folks said they were blown away by the level of energy, enthusiasm, knowledge, and professionalism in that group. One of them said he wished he could bottle up that energy and take it back to California. GamesBeat: U.S. money has been going all over the world for decades. I suppose you could put an interpretation on that money. When China was also in the position of being able to finance a lot of the world, I think people wondered if they have a philosophy that also gets exported along with those investments in all those companies. Do they run these companies in a Chinese way? What is your own view as far as the next entity that really has the opportunity to invest all over the world? Is there a philosophy you\u2019d like to export, but also maybe one that stays at home in Saudi Arabia as well? Ward: There isn\u2019t a philosophy, other than we\u2019ve always intended to be and have been consistent in communicating this \u2013 we\u2019ve been given carte blanche to operate like a true games company, consistent with the values of our industry, what people consider to be important. That\u2019s been true. That was one thing I was pretty alive to when I first thought about the opportunity, because to your point, Chinese companies tend to operate \u2013 not all of them, but they tend to operate in a Chinese way. Western companies operate in a western way. But I can\u2019t say there\u2019s any defining set of values around being a Saudi games company. We\u2019re just trying to be a games company, period. GamesBeat: One interesting data point, maybe, that I was thinking about now. I wrote a profile on this guy named Amir Satvat who works for Amazon. He\u2019s kind of a quant. During the big layoffs that started happening in the fall, he started scraping all the game industry sites for job openings. He aggregated them into a spreadsheet on LinkedIn and made it available for everyone to look at. Here\u2019s all the jobs. He came up with 732 companies and 14,000 jobs that are open. The fun part was that he\u2019s noticed that for the last six weeks or so, that number has been steady. He sees that as a stabilization happening over a relatively short amount of time. Before that openings were tending to go down. Does that mean anything to you, that the collective number of jobs in the game industry is starting to go back up? Ward: I\u2019m not an expert by any stretch. I would anticipate that most of the post-COVID reconciliation of how many users there are, the engagement level and so forth has sorted itself out in terms of how many people we need to meet demand. We should start to be back to business as usual. That\u2019s what I would expect. GamesBeat: There\u2019s AI as well. Nobody knows what that\u2019s going to mean. I talked to a professor a few weeks ago who was saying that we could have a 10% boost to world GDP by 2032 with all the AI advances happening now. That\u2019s $11 trillion. That\u2019s happening. He thinks there\u2019s going to be more change in the next 10 years from AI than in the last 150 years of industrial revolution. One of his guys looked at a typical 2,000-person enterprise and found that jobs in that enterprise would probably be done with one-third to two-thirds fewer people. All these things seem to suggest we\u2019re about to be in another time of change. We thought there was change already in the last few decades, but there\u2019s more coming. Ward: But isn\u2019t that one of the best things about our industry, the constant change and development and evolution of it? I think AI is going to add a lot of jobs. There will be shifting in who does what. Did we need less artists when SpeedTree was introduced? No, we needed more. More tools mean more stuff gets done. That\u2019s the way I view it. GamesBeat's creed when covering the game industry is \"where passion meets business.\" What does this mean?

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips For savvy investors, this hints at transportation giants focused on the movement of goods, especially those with tempting valuations. The post The 3 Best Transportation Stocks to Buy Now: September 2023 appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Transportation is a classic contender in the investment realm that often goes unnoticed. It might not have the glitz of newer sectors, but it stitches together over 5% of the U.S. GDP, translating to $1.3 trillion annually . For savvy investors, the search for the best transportation stocks begins here, blending tradition with tremendous potential. Moreover, even in the face of economic drizzles, some transportation companies sail smoothly, showing us their tenacity. While the broader stock market might occasionally catch a cold, those in the know are spotting golden opportunities. Among those are transportation stocks with rock-solid foundations. Furthermore, shopping sprees are set for a comeback as consumers\u2019 wanderlust for experiences settles down. For savvy investors, this hints at transportation giants focused on the movement of goods, especially those with tempting valuations. So, buckle up as we journey through three transportation stocks poised for a rewarding ride. Uber ( UBER ) Uber (NYSE: UBER ) has revved up to become the poster child of disruptive innovation. Displacing traditional taxis and pioneering the ride-sharing movement, Uber has effectively reshaped the dynamics of city transportation. But Uber didn\u2019t just stop at dropping you off at your destinations. Their progressive business plan brings food to your doorstep with Uber Eats. To go a mile further, they have revamped logistics with Uber Freight and Uber Business. The recent financial figures only underscore its relentless drive forward. Though its Q2 revenue of $9.23 billion narrowly missed projections, its net income of $394 million (or 18 cents per share) stole the show. In contrast was a staggering loss of $2.6 billion for the same quarter. It reported its first-ever quarterly operating profit of $326 million, along with a roaring free cash flow growth to $1.14 billion. This represents a near 200% bump from the prior year. Now, while it may not be rubbing shoulders with the elites in the S&P 500 just yet, the winds suggest it\u2019s prepping its grand entrance. Given its solid performances, it\u2019s undeniably one of the season\u2019s most unexpected yet delightful surprises. Canadian National Railway ( CNI ) Canadian National Railway (NYSE: CNI ) stands out as a robust pillar in the North American railroad landscape, bridging key territories across Canada and the midwestern U.S. Over the past decade, it has proven to be an excellent wealth compounder, delighting shareholders with a substantial 126% bump in its share price. It recently posted mixed earnings in its second-quarter, locking revenues at 4.06 billion CAD and grappling with an 8% drop in earnings-per-share compared to the prior year. However, the quarter was marred by a confluence of Canadian wildfires and economic ripples, viewed as transient clouds on CNI\u2019s horizon. Nevertheless, it still posted a budding 10% uptick in free cash flow, a testament to the company\u2019s resiliency. As we shift our gaze to the future, CNI holds a buoyant vision, forecasting potent growth between 10% to 15% in long-term earnings per share. Moreover, it promises 14.4% upside and a comforting 2.07% dividend yield. Boeing Co. ( BA ) Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA ), a titan in aerospace, is soaring to new heights. The aviation behemoth is renowned for its cutting-edge commercial jets and formidable defense systems. It posted an impressive Q2 revenue of $19.75 billion, eclipsing the projected $18.57 billion. This uptick can be credited to various factors, chiefly the resurgence in passenger traffic across the U.S., Europe, and Asia in the post-pandemic era. Furthermore, despite the headwinds stemming from supply chain hiccups and the recent blip around the Boeing 737 MAX, the company\u2019s trajectory remains skyward. A testament to this is the 12% jump in deliveries and a healthy 41% surge in revenues during its second-quarter. Pivoting to China, recent developments have bolstered Boeing\u2019s standing, marking a rebound from earlier setbacks. Given these indicators, Boeing\u2019s flight path looks set on a promising horizon.

        "content": "Forbes Leadership Leadership Strategy Next Recession Not Likely A Disaster Bill Conerly Senior Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. I connect the dots between the economy ... and business! Following Sep 9, 2023, 07:30am EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Job seekers in 2008-09 recession. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) Getty Images The next recession will not be a disaster. I expect a recession to begin early in 2024, or possibly late this year, and that frightens many people. But recessions do not hurt most people, though they certainly can be very harmful to some. Employment in Recessions Unemployment rises during recessions, but not as much as we seem to fear. In the recessions between 1948 and 2019, the unemployment rate during the downturns was 1.4 percentage point higher than in the 12 months preceding the recession. The average time spent unemployed increased by less than one week during recessions. Working hours are cut in recessions, but by only 24 minutes a week on average. (The Data Note at the end of this article explains the methodology behind the numbers in this article.) Definition of Recession In assessing the data, we must remember that economists define a recession as the period when economic activity is declining. Once the decline is over and the economy turns up a little, we say the recession is over even though we have not yet recovered all of the lost ground. For some variables, the data often look their worst just after the recession has technically ended. Home Prices in Recession The median and average selling prices of homes usually rise in recession. That\u2019s surprising given what happened in 2008-09, when prices fell six percent by our comparison of the recession average to the 12 prior months. From the peak for prices (which occurred a year before the recession began), to the trough (two years after the recession ended), the decline was a whopping 19%. Recessions are not good for home prices. But prices usually rise over the long haul. Recessions typically slow the rise without turning prices downward. Of the ten recessions for which we have data (not counting 2020), only one shows a clear decline in prices. Eight recessions had home price increases, with the 1990 recession ambiguous.

Keep in mind that delinquent means at least 30 days late. Most delinquencies do not result in foreclosure. Banks write off more consumer loans in recession, but by less than one percentage point. Commercial real estate is even safer, with charge-offs increasing by only 0.6 percentage points. Business non-real estate lending charge-offs rise by a similar amount. Most Recession Effects Temporary In the typical economic model, the effects of a recession are temporary because the economy bounces back with above-normal growth rates, regaining its trend line. There have been some studies finding long-lasting impacts on those people who tried to find their first jobs during a recession and on people who were laid off in a recession. These studies are suggestive rather than definitive given data limitations. The most cited study found the impacts lasted seven to ten years but were not permanent. 2008-09 Recession Was Unusually Bad Today\u2019s fear of recession probably derives from the 2008-09 experience, which was especially harsh. In terms of overall impact on gross domestic product, that recession was twice as bad as the average recession preceding it. GDP declines in recessions. Dr. Bill Conerly based on data from U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis The chart shows substantial variation from one recession to another. For other variables, such as the average duration of unemployment, the range is comparably large. The largest recession increase was 2.2 weeks; the smallest 0.2 weeks. That illustrates that each recession is unique. The underly economy evolves over time, making the likely effects of a recession in the 2020s different from the 1950s. In addition, each recession occurs with unique external influences, such as world oil prices. Policy responses to recession also vary from case to case. As a result, we should not expect any particular downturn to mirror a past recession. But the past does give us an idea of the likely range of possibilities. Data Note: Recessions are defined by the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private non-profit organization. I do not include the 2020 recession in these calculations because it was atypical, being just two months in duration but very severe in magnitude. Some of the data series are not available back to 1948, so their averages were calculated over shorter time periods. Comparison of recessions with the 12 months preceding the recession is done because of drift over time in unemployment and other variables. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn . Check out my website .

Modi has painted the summit as India's diplomatic coming of age and is pushing for his country -- which wants a permanent seat on the UN Security Council -- to be seen as a voice of the Global South. At full strength the African Union has 55 members, but six junta-ruled nations are currently suspended. Collectively it has a GDP of $3 trillion with some 1.4 billion people. As the G20, the grouping included 19 countries and the European Union, representing 85 percent of the world GDP, with South Africa its only member state from the continent. It was conceived in the throes of the 2008 financial crisis as a way of managing the global economy, but finding consensus among members has been increasingly difficult in recent years. The AU membership could be among the most tangible outcomes from the summit itself, with Modi trying to forge consensus on a host of contentious issues, and key G20 members deeply divided over Russia's war in Ukraine and how to pay for climate change. On the summit sidelines, G20 partners will unveil ambitious plans Saturday to bolster trade between India, the Middle East and Europe, the United States said. It is a modern-day Spice Route that could more closely bind three regions that account for about a third of the global economy -- and represent an alternative to China's vast investment in global infrastructure. Washington, Saudi Arabia, the EU, UAE and others will sign an agreement on the sidelines of the G20 summit to explore a railway and port project to augment trade flows between Europe and India, officials said. The agreement comes with Washington actively engaging with Riyadh, a major oil producer and security partner, as it encourages the kingdom to normalise ties with Israel. Jon Finer, US deputy national security advisor, said the announcement came after \"months of careful diplomacy, quiet, careful diplomacy, bilaterally and in multilateral settings\". This project \"has enormous potential\" he said. \"But exactly how long it takes, I don't know\". The project is still in the early stages, with participants studying how best to link India's vast 1.4 billion population and quick-growing economy with markets to the west. But Michael Kugelman, South Asia Institute director at The Wilson Center, said the plan could be a significant response to China's much-vaunted Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) -- which has spread Chinese influence, investments and commerce across Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America. \"If finalised, it would be a game changer that strengthens connectivity between India and the Middle East and would aim to counter BRI,\" Kugelman posted on X, formerly known as Twitter . The plans will include data, rail, electricity and hydrogen pipeline links, EU officials told AFP. Chinese leader Xi Jinping himself is skipping the summit, sending his number two, Premier Li Qiang, to India instead in a move that called into question the meeting's importance. No official reason was given for Xi's absence, but the Asian giants have been at loggerheads over a border dispute and other issues, while Beijing is seeking to make US-led groupings such as the G20 more amenable to its own interests. Russia's seat is taken by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, with diplomatic opprobrium and war crimes charges keeping the country's leader Vladimir Putin from the summit. United Nations chief Antonio Guterres warned Friday of growing global divisions, insisting countries must assume responsibility regardless of \"whether it's the president or the prime minister or the vice president\" who is in New Delhi. The backdrop to the talks could hardly be starker: the European Union's climate monitor has said this year is likely to be the hottest in human history, with Guterres declaring on Friday the \"climate crisis is spiralling out of control\". G20 countries account for around 85 percent of global climate warming emissions, making action in the forum crucial to real progress. G20 \u00a9 Copyright IBTimes 2023. All rights reserved.

Divided over Russia's war in Ukraine and gridlocked on finding agreement to slash carbon emissions, the summit's most tangible outcome could be the expected accession of the African Union to the grouping that represents 85 percent of global GDP. The Group of 20 was conceived in the throes of the 2008 financial crisis as a way of managing the global economy. But finding consensus among members has been increasingly difficult in recent years. Even before it began, the importance of the New Delhi summit was called into question when China's Xi Jinping decided to skip the meeting and send his number two, Premier Li Qiang, to India instead. No official reason was given for Xi's absence, but the Asian giants have been at loggerheads over a border dispute and other issues, while Beijing is seeking to make US-led groupings such as the G20 more amenable to its own interests. Russia's seat is taken by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, with diplomatic opprobrium and war crimes charges keeping the country's leader Vladimir Putin from the summit. United Nations chief Antonio Guterres warned Friday of growing global divisions, insisting countries must assume responsibility regardless of \"whether it's the president or the prime minister or the vice president\" who is in New Delhi. The backdrop to the talks could hardly be starker: the European Union's climate monitor has said this year is likely to be the hottest in human history, with Guterres declaring on Friday the \"climate crisis is spiralling out of control\". G20 countries account for around 85 percent of global climate warming emissions, making action in the forum crucial to real progress. India's Modi has painted the summit as his country's diplomatic coming of age -- evidence of New Delhi's clout and prestige on the global stage. While spoilers may yet stop the bid, Modi does look set to secure one notable diplomatic victory, with several leaders expressing support for expanding the bloc into the \"G21\" by including the African Union as a permanent member. The move would help burnish Modi's image as a self-styled leader of the \"Global South\", a bridge between developed and developing countries. Modi argues developing nations need a greater say in global decision-making, and an invitation for the 55-member AU to join could come as soon as Saturday. South Africa is currently the only G20 member from the continent. But on Ukraine there was little sign of progress. Moscow continues to press its allies to water down international condemnation of its invasion of Ukraine, throwing up a major roadblock to joint action. Ahead of his arrival in New Delhi on Friday, US President Joe Biden insisted that the G20 can still \"deliver\", even as markets fret that a trade war between the world's two largest economies -- the United States and China -- is poised to escalate. Many G20 leaders fear their countries are already at risk of becoming collateral damage as the big beasts of world trade lock horns. Washington has restricted US technology transfers to the world's second-largest economy and rumours have swirled that Beijing may be about to ban Apple's ubiquitous iPhone -- most of which are made in China. China was overtaken as the world's most populous country by India this year and growth is slowing, with economists pointing to structural problems such as a shrinking labour force, slower productivity and an overheated real estate market.

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips In today\u2019s Market 360, let\u2019s review the comments four Fed officials made about inflation and interest rates. We\u2019ll consider if there are any clues in their statements that indicate what the Fed will do at its next FOMC meeting, and then I\u2019ll share how to build your portfolio while we wait on the Fed. The post Highlights From This Week\u2019s Fed Speakers appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "The next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting might not be for another couple weeks, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the Fed has been sitting on its laurels ahead of the meeting. On Wednesday, the Fed released its Beige Book survey in preparation for its September FOMC meeting. The good news is the Beige Book survey acknowledged that inflation pressures are abating, and that job growth is slowing. Almost all of the Fed\u2019s 12 districts indicated that businesses \u201crenewed their previously unfulfilled expectations that wage growth will slow broadly in the near term.\u201d The only inflation warning was a comment saying that \u201ccontacts in several districts highlighted sharp increases in property insurance costs during the past few months.\u201d So apparently the insurance companies fleeing California, Florida and other high-risk areas may be hindering some housing markets. Several Fed members also spoke throughout the week, offering their insights on the economy and the current state of inflation. So, in today\u2019s Market 360 , let\u2019s review the comments four Fed officials made about inflation and interest rates. We\u2019ll consider what this means for the next FOMC meeting, and then I\u2019ll share how to build your portfolio while we wait on the Fed. Comments From Four Fed Officials Boston Fed President Susan Collins : She expects that the economy will start to weaken as we round out the year \u2013 and stay weak throughout 2024. Although recent U.S. economic data has shown that the economy is accelerating (the Atlanta Fed expects GDP growth of 5.6% in the third quarter), Collins believes there are underlying issues. She said that people\u2019s pandemic savings are dwindling and spending will become more sensitive to interest. She also believes that \u201can orderly slowdown\u201d can bring inflation toward price stability. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee : He clarified his stance that the economy can get on a \u201cgolden path\u201d to getting inflation down while avoiding a recession. He believes that it\u2019s a possibility, though not a guarantee. He noted that he wants to see inflation in goods and housing slow, but believes monetary policy is working. He said: \u201cWe are very rapidly approaching the time when our argument is not going to be about how high should the rates go; it\u2019s going to be an argument about how long do we need to keep the rates at this position.\u201d New York Fed President John Williams: He said he expects the current unemployment rate of 3.8% to rise to the low 4% range \u2013 but doesn\u2019t expect joblessness to reach levels of past recessions. On the topic of inflation, he declined to say whether he believes the Fed should raise rates again. He said, \u201cThings are moving in the right direction and we\u2019ve got policy in a good place, but we\u2019re going to need to continue to be data dependent, watch developments and assess what we need to do.\u201d He also said that \u201call that talk about we\u2019re about to have a recession has vanished.\u201d Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan : \u201cAnother skip could be appropriate when we meet later this month\u2026 But skipping does not imply stopping. In the coming months, further evaluation of the data and outlook could confirm that we need to do more to extinguish inflation.\u201d The bottom line : Based on their comments, it seems that the Fed is leaning towards not raising key interest rates at its next FOMC meeting. Personally, I don\u2019t expect the Fed to hike key interest rates, especially given that the Beige Book cited slowing economic growth in July and August. The majority of the market agrees, as analysts now believe there\u2019s a 93% chance that the Fed does not raise key interest rates in September. I should also add that the Fed could even start cutting rates as early as December. The annual core rate of inflation should be under 2% later this year, which could be the final push our central bank needs to cut rates. Build a Diverse Portfolio In the current market environment, you\u2019ll want to build a diverse portfolio of fundamentally superior stocks . You do not want to merely invest in one hot trend, one industry or one bucket of stocks. As an example, the last two months represented my strongest relative performance for my Growth Investor High-Growth Investments Buy List compared to the S&P 500 since last October and November. The strength of my overall Buy List is a direct representation of owning stocks across a variety of industries \u2013 AI, energy, consumer, solar, homebuilders and building supply companies. If you can build your personal portfolio with my fundamentally superior Growth Investor stocks, you can invest confidently and not worry about all the distractions that tend to derail the stock market\u2026 like Fed officials\u2019 speeches and statements this week or the upcoming FOMC meeting.

There is a great divide opening up in America \u2013 and investing in my Growth Investor stocks will help get you on the right side of it. On one side is a new aristocracy that\u2019s amassing more wealth more quickly than any other group in American history. For people like me, the one percent , life has never been better, more prosperous. On the other side, the opposite is happening. Wealth is flowing out of the pockets of ordinary Americans at an unprecedented rate. What\u2019s happening is only going to gather in strength over the coming decades. It certainly won\u2019t weaken. Few Americans even know that any of this is going on. I\u2019ve never seen anyone from my side of the chasm step forward to explain any of these things . It\u2019s why I put together this video . In it, I\u2019ll lay out exactly what is happening, including several key steps every American should take right now.",

        "description": "Health care profiteers make up 3 of the top 5 spenders on lobbying in Pennsylvania.",
        "content": "In Pennsylvania, healthcare profiteers top the list of the most aggressive spenders on lobbying in the state. Corporations in the United States spend hundreds of millions of dollars every year on well connected lobbyists to influence legislation both on a federal level and in states and cities. Pennsylvania is one of the many states in the US with relatively loose regulations on lobbying and gifts to legislators. For example, lawmakers can accept gifts worth any amount, even cash, from lobbyists as long as they disclose those gifts. These loose lobbying regulations, combined with the unlimited spending on campaign contributions, make it easy for corporations to exert their influence over elected officials in the capital city of Harrisburg. Healthcare has been the number one top sector in lobbying spending in Pennsylvania for at least the past 10 years. According to the PA Department of State, the margin spent over other sectors has only gotten larger . In 2022 , nearly $30 million was spent on direct healthcare lobbying, about $11 million was spent on Medicare and Medicaid, and over $13 million was spent on insurance lobbying. Together, that\u2019s more than the total lobbying spending on energy, the state budget, and education combined. In fact, in 2022, healthcare related entities represented three out of the top five top spenders on lobbying in the state. This spending is driven by large healthcare insurers and hospital systems, many of which have Medicaid contracts in Pennsylvania that are worth billions of dollars. These large corporations and their trade associations use their power to lobby against adequate nurse-to-patient ratios , against policies that hold hospitals responsible for medical malpractice , and lobby against legislation that would require that state Medicaid contractors cooperate in good faith with labor unions. To preserve the status quo and the large revenue stream from Medicare and Medicaid, these companies spend millions on lobbying legislators themselves and also work together through industry trade groups like the Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania and the Hospital and HealthSystem Association of Pennsylvania. Large hospital systems and health insurers have immense power in communities and states not only because of their role in providing critical care, but also because they are typically among the largest employers in their region. The members of the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania (HAP) employ nearly 600,000 people across the state, or about one in 10 jobs statewide . Not only do workers in Pennsylvania depend on the industry for their livelihoods, but the millions of people insured by these companies depend on them to help cover the high cost of healthcare. Yet, these institutions are making billions of dollars in profits for executives and shareholders while squeezing ever increasing premiums out of their customers and refusing to pay many of their workers living wages. Large health insurers like UnitedHealth, Aetna, UPMC, Independence Blue Cross, and Geisinger spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions in the state capitol. In 2022, UPMC spent over $740,000 on lobbying while Geisinger spent over $950,000. Spending even more than both of these healthcare giants was Philadelphia-based Independence Blue Cross. Independence Blue Cross (IBX) is a health insurer based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that serves over seven million people and brought in almost $27.4 billion in revenue in 2022. The corporation has been steadily increasing its spending on state lobbying and hit a five year high in 2022, spending over $3.2 million. IBX spends more than any other entity on lobbying in the state of Pennsylvania. While corporations are not required to disclose what bills their lobbyists work on, Independence Blue Cross\u2019s latest quarterly lobbying report states that it lobbied on issues related to Healthcare, Insurance, Managed Care, and Medicare/Medicaid. Independence Blue Cross\u2019s subsidiary, Keystone First, is the largest Medicaid managed care provider in the state, serving over 400,000 people in Southeast Pennsylvania. IBX also offers Medicare Advantage plans, or privatized Medicare, for Pennsylvania\u2019s seniors. With billions of dollars flowing in from government programs, it\u2019s critical that Independence Blue Cross stay in the good graces of legislators both in the federal and state government. IBX spent over $1.4 million on federal lobbying in 2022. According to Lobbying Disclosure Act reports filed in 2022, the corporation spent most of its resources lobbying on Medicare Advantage, a privatized Medicare program. In 2020, Independence Blue Cross subsidiaries agreed to pay over $2.25 million after allegations that the corporations inflated the costs of their Medicare Advantage programs in their bid to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. An audit in 2023 also found that IBX received over a half million dollars in overpayments through the Medicare Advantage program . IBX President and CEO Gregory E. Deavens sits on the board of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a group that has been lobbying the federal government to avoid cracking down on these types of Medicare Advantage overpayments . In other words, IBX is advocating for the government to allow insurers to commit fraud in Medicare Advantage payments. While these programs are federal, states have the power to regulate and administer them in ways that can either benefit the corporation\u2019s bottom line or not. To ensure the former, IBX hires some of the most well connected lobbyists in the state and its executives and former executives are among the most powerful influencers in the state. The corporation currently has access to 39 registered lobbyists through 10 retained lobbying firms in Pennsylvania. Some higher profile lobbyists include Anthony Costa, son of Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa; Todd Nyquist, former Chief of Staff for former State Senate President Corman; and Megan Crompton, wife of former Republican Commonwealth Court Judge (recently turned lobbyist ) Andrew Crompton. Former Governor Tom Ridge, now owner of the Ridge Policy Group, also now lobbies for Independence Blue Cross. IBX President and CEO, Deavans, also served on the transition leadership team for current Pennsylvania Governor, Josh Shapiro. The Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania is a trade group for large insurance companies in Pennsylvania. Its members include large health insurers like UPMC, Aetna, Cigna, and UnitedHealth and large personal or auto insurers like Erie Insurance, Nationwide, Liberty Mutual, Metlife, and Chubb. Members pay dues that help pay for the millions in lobbying expenses. For example, Cigna and UnitedHealth Group reported spending more than $50,000 each in dues to the Federation in 2022. The Federation is led by Board Chair Brian Bolash, of Erie Insurance, and President Jonathan Greer, former Director of Policy for Governor Ridge. It spends about $2 million per year lobbying in Harrisburg, with the most recent quarterly report showing that it spent over $125,000 on gifts, food, lodging, and transportation for government officials in just three months. The Insurance Federation doesn\u2019t use outside lobbying firms but relies on the political ties of its own staff to influence the state legislature. In addition to the group\u2019s President having previously held positions in the Governor\u2019s Office and the State Senate, the group\u2019s Director of Government Affairs, Noah Karn, has deep ties to the Pennsylvania state legislature. Karn served as the Executive Director of the State House Labor and Industry Committee, Policy Analyst for former House Speaker Mike Turzai, and was the Chief of Staff to Republican State Senator Mike Regan. These lobbyists for the Insurance Federation work on issues that would impact the profits of the insurance giants listed above. For example, the Federation opposed a state mandate that would have ensured telehealth be covered by insurance during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Federation also opposed a bill that would have created a Family and Medical Leave Insurance Program to provide financial assistance to workers on family or medical leave during the pandemic. While thousands of Pennsylvanians were falling ill to Covid-19 and potentially losing income while on leave, the large health insurers behind the Federation were blocking legislation that could have helped ease that financial strain. At the same time, in 2021, Insurance Federation members like UPMC brought in a record $23.1 billion in revenue, Aetna brought in over $7.9 billion in profits, and UnitedHealth Group made over $17.7 billion in profits . The Hospital and Health Association of Pennsylvania (HAP) is a trade association made up of 235 large hospital systems in Pennsylvania. The group spends millions on lobbying efforts every year in Harrisburg and also spends around $300,000 on federal lobbying every year . Most of the nearly $1.6 million that the Association spent on state lobbying was spent on direct lobbying of legislators or advertising materials, but the group also spends thousands of dollars on dinners, lodging, transportation, and/or gifts to legislators and their families. Since 2021, HAP has spent $15,337 on gifts and dinners for legislators according to the state lobbying database . Major hospital systems on the group\u2019s board of directors include UPMC, Highmark, Geisinger, Lehigh Valley Health Network, UPenn Health System, and the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. Together these health systems and hospitals brought in over $500 million in revenue that exceeded their expenditures last year, despite many being nonprofit organizations. Much of the wealth created by these so-called nonprofits goes to top executives and board members. For example, at UPMC, board members and the highest paid employees at the organization were paid a total of $184.9 million in 2022 . In 2021, Highmark Health paid its board and executives nearly $40 million and spent over $10 million on high end business consultants like Deloitte. The Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia gave its board members and executives about $33 million in 2022 . The group\u2019s PAC spent over $400,000 in the 2022 election cycle in Pennsylvania alone. Highmark was by far the top contributor to the PAC, giving over $60,000 from its corporate PAC in one year. The Hospital and Health Association\u2019s PAC, or HAPAC, gave mostly to Republican House and Senate Campaign Committees and Republican leadership, with the exception of $10,000 to Governor Josh Shapiro and a $5,000 gift to fund Shapiro\u2019s transition team . Further, Heather Tyler, Vice President of State Legislative Advocacy at HAP, served on Governor Shapiro\u2019s transition team. The group\u2019s PAC spent over $400,000 in the 2022 election cycle in Pennsylvania alone. Highmark was by far the top contributor to the PAC, giving over $60,000 from its corporate PAC in one year. The Hospital and Health Association\u2019s PAC, or HAPAC, gave mostly to Republican House and Senate Campaign Committees and Republican leadership, with the exception of $10,000 to Governor Josh Shapiro and a $5,000 gift to fund Shapiro\u2019s transition team . Further, Heather Tyler, Vice President of State Legislative Advocacy at HAP, served on Governor Shapiro\u2019s transition team. According to the HAP\u2019s website, the group lobbies for the deregulation of the industry and to limit the liability of hospitals in malpractice cases. In fact, the Association is a part of the Coalition for Civil Justice Reform along with the PA Medical Society, the Pennsylvania Health Care Association, and the right wing group, the Pennsylvania Manufacturers Society (which has significant ties to right wing billionaire Jeffrey Yass). The Coalition collectively spent hundreds of thousands of dollars during the Covid-19 pandemic, in part to ensure that corporations in the state could not be sued if customers or employees were to contract Covid-19 from their business. The Hospital and Healthsystem Association is represented by high profile lobbyists including former Commonwealth Court Judge, Drew Crompton, and founder of the BRAVO Group. Chris Bravacos. Bravacos worked in the Governor Ridge administration as well as for the Republican Party of Pennsylvania, and is the Chair of Excellent Schools PA PAC (funded largely by billionaire right wing donor, Jeffrey Yass ). The immense and often unchecked power of the healthcare industry unfortunately leads to thousands of non-union, low wage jobs, increasing medical debt for Pennsylvanians, and skyrocketing medical costs that keep people from seeking the care they need. A study out of Kaiser Health found that over one million people in Pennsylvania have medical debt. While legislation has been introduced in the Pennsylvania State House to forgive medical debt, it\u2019s clear that the healthcare industry\u2019s army of lobbyists is prepared to protect its bottom line. When faced with invitations to dinners from these lobbyists or campaign donations from these companies\u2019 PACs, legislators must decide, then, if they stand with large hospitals and giant insurers or their constituents that need quality and affordable care.",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Here's why Meta Platforms remains a top option in the technology space for long-term value investors in this current environment. The post META Stock Outlook: 3 Catalysts That Could Fuel Meta Platform\u2019s Next Rally appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) had a turbulent 2022, plunging from a high of roughly $380 per share to the $88 level, and then more than tripling in early 2023. At around $300 per share at the time of writing, META stock has certainly become one of the come back stories investors like to see. Those who have held this stock through the turbulence are none the worse for the wear, especially if those same investors bought the stock years ago. Of course, n ews often mirrors stock performance, and it\u2019s crucial to remember the negative headlines about Meta during its decline. Now, optimism abounds for many large-cap tech stocks . That said, investors must consider whether it\u2019s overvalued or rightfully bullish after its roughly 10% decline from its recent peak. Here are three catalysts I think are worth watching when it comes to Meta right now. Meta Platforms is Being Re-Rated Higher Among 42 analysts , 40 rate Mets Platforms stock as \u201cbuy,\u201d with none issuing a recent \u201csell\u201d rating, despite its August decline. Analysts, like Scott Devitt from Wedbush, see potential in Meta\u2019s job cuts leading to improved margins. Devitt notes enhanced monetization in newer areas like Reels and click-to-message ads, setting a $350 price target for META stock. Similarly, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) analysts, with a $375 price target, anticipate renewed enthusiasm for Meta\u2019s stock in 2024 once spending targets are clearer. As more analysts jump on Meta Platforms as a potential long-term opportunity, I expect more price target hikes and upgrades on the horizon. Strong Fundamentals Meta stands out in the tech sector with just 21.6% of its capitalization comprised of debt, a modest figure compared to other tech firms. Meta\u2019s free cash flow, around $24 billion this year , surpasses its total debt of approximately $37 billion, a rarity in the corporate world. This robust cash flow has allowed Meta to repurchase 101 million of its own shares in the past year, benefiting shareholders and boosting stock prices. Meta\u2019s return on invested capital (or ROIC) historically ranged from 15% to 20%, ensuring that the money used for stock buybacks generates similar returns for shareholders. While criticism exists for Meta\u2019s investment in the metaverse, which has yet to yield expected profits, it has lowered ROIC to 14%, still strong compared to many companies. Meta\u2019s robust fundamentals extend to its market share, with Facebook commanding 53.1% of all social media visits (excluding Instagram). This significant presence offers multiple avenues for monetization, irrespective of the metaverse\u2019s success. AI Is The Main Near-Term Catalyst Meta Platforms understands the need for substantial investments in specific areas. It\u2019s a manageable challenge as long as the company can maintain strong revenue growth. While Q2 2023 showed an 11% year-over-year revenue increase, the focus now shifts to what will drive revenue growth in the latter half of 2023 and 2024. Meta Platforms is said to be working on an AI bot for enhancing business customer service and an internal AI tool designed to boost staff productivity. Of course, given the attention around artificial intelligence of late, this has garnered some attention. That said, over the longer-term, we\u2019ll have to see how this actually impacts the company\u2019s bottom line (if it\u2019s more or less like Meta\u2019s move into the metaverse, for example). What Now for Meta Platforms? While Meta shifts its focus to Threads and monetizing Instagram/WhatsApp, the metaverse project might lose some prominence. However, analysts expect double-digit earnings per share growth (around 26.7%) over the next twelve months, which could propel the stock higher, given the historical link between EPS and stock prices. Consider the potential if they redirect metaverse spending is redirected elsewhere, possibly restoring ROIC to its historical levels. This could result in more substantial share buybacks and higher analyst targets due to improved monetization and ROIC. Investors should seize this opportunity.

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Understanding The Difference Between Cash Flow And Profit getty Positive cash flow is critical to a successful business. Business owners may understand the importance of generating profits; however, focusing on profit alone may lead to the neglect of cash flow. Operating a profitable business requires understanding the difference between cash flow and profit. Cash flow and profit are two critical measures of financial performance which businesses must track to survive and thrive but are different in many ways. Understanding these crucial financial aspects will help you operate your business more efficiently, make informed financial decisions, and stay profitable in the long run. Cash flow and its importance Cash flow refers to the movement of cash in and out of your business and preventing cash shortages at any time in your business cycle is critical. It is the steady movement of cash in and out of your business that keeps it alive and thriving. However, preventing cash shortages is also critical to the success of your business because cash shortages can be the death of any business, no matter how successful it may seem on the outside. The good news is that there are ways to prevent cash shortages and maintain a healthy cash flow. By managing your expenses, increasing your revenue streams, and staying on top of your accounts receivables, you can keep your business running smoothly and ensure that cash shortages never disrupt your operations. Cash flow is the lifeblood of your business, so keep it flowing to enjoy long-term success.

Is A Calculated Bet To Fund Troubled Startups The First Step? New Pixel 8 Pro Leaks Reveal Google s Smart Decision Cash flow is critical for the business's day-to-day operations, particularly for small businesses. Having a good cash flow enables the business owner to pay for ongoing expenses such as rent, salaries, inventory, and other business expenses. Without cash flow, your business may struggle to cover its daily expenses, leading to cash flow problems and ultimately, business failure. Profit and its importance Profit is the income earned from sales after deducting expenses like cost of goods sold, rent, payroll, and other expenses. Profitability is a vital concern for all businesses, providing a measure of the business's overall success. Increasing revenue and profit enables the business owner to grow and expand the business, making it more resilient to economic challenges. You likely understand that profit and cash flow are two crucial components of a successful operation. While profit represents the money your business earns after all expenses are paid, cash flow refers to the actual cash coming in and out of your business. It's important to note that profit affects cash flow directly and can either bolster or diminish your cash levels. Put simply, if your business isn't profitable, it will eat away at your cash levels and potentially leave you with a cash flow deficit. Therefore, it's crucial to prioritize profitability in your business strategy to maintain healthy cash flow levels and ensure long-term success. However, an increase in profits may not always translate to good cash flow. For example, if you have made sales to customers who have not yet paid you for the goods, this does not mean that your cash flow is healthy. Thus, the focus on profitability must always be balanced with cash flow monitoring. Monitoring cash flow and profit Monitoring your business's cash flow and profitability helps you keep track of your finances and make informed business decisions. Cash flow projections allow you to anticipate any future cash shortfalls and plan accordingly. On the other hand, profitability monitoring enables you to calculate your return on investment, track revenue growth, and identify areas of the business that may be underperforming. Monitoring cash flow and profitability together will help you prioritize your spending decisions and identify areas of the business that may need attention. The bottom line is that understanding the difference between cash flow and profit is critical for any business owner. While both measures are interrelated, they are distinct financial indicators that measure different aspects of a business's operations. While profitability enables the business owner to grow and expand the business, having good cash flow helps the business survive and thrive. Monitoring cash flow and profitability helps the business owner make informed financial decisions to keep the business healthy and profitable. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

        "content": "Plugin vehicles are all the rage in the Chinese auto market. Plugins scored over 658,000 sales last month, up 31% year over year (YoY). That pulled the year-to-date (YTD) tally to over 3.9 million units. Share-wise, with July showing another great performance, plugin vehicles hit 38% market share! Full electrics (BEVs) alone accounted for 26% of the country\u2019s auto sales. This pulled the 2023 share to 36% (24% BEVs), and considering the current growth rate, we can assume that China\u2019s plugin vehicle market share will end over 40% by the end of 2023. Another measure of the importance of this market is the fact that China alone represented around 60% of global plugin registrations last month! Looking at July\u2019s best sellers in the overall market, we see plugins populating the top positions, with 4 plugin models in the overall top 5. And to think: in other markets, we celebrate when one EV breaks into the overall top 10\u2026. The 20 Best Selling Electric Vehicles in China \u2014 July 2023 Here\u2019s more info and commentary on July\u2019s top selling electric models, again with only BYDs and Teslas in the top 7 positions : #1 \u2014 BYD Song (BEV+PHEV) BYD\u2019s midsize SUV was top dog in the overall Chinese automotive market, with BYD\u2019s current star player scoring 50,440 registrations . Will the Song end the year as the best selling model in the Chinese automotive market? Well, it depends on the competition, especially the internal competition. Currently, the Song only has the recently introduced Frigate 07 PHEV as internal competition, but the upcoming Song L (BYD\u2019s take on the Tesla Model Y theme) and its premium cousin, the Denza N7, are both set to land soon. This is probably too much competition inside BYD\u2019s midsize SUV portfolio (the regular Song as the lower priced model, the Frigate 07 & Song L as mid-priced models, and finally the upmarket Denza N7). Also, the current wave of price cuts, which is spreading through the local market, will be a decisive factor. They will be decisive for the Song to continue clocking 40,000+ sales/month, a necessary threshold to continue leading the cutthroat Chinese auto market. #2 \u2014 BYD Qin Plus (BEV+PHEV) Thanks to a recent refresh and price cut, the BYD Qin Plus has been rejuvenated and its sales have jumped again. The midsizer reached 42,155 registrations in July, with the BEV version alone scoring 11,455 registrations . With prices now starting at 100,000 CNY ($15,000), demand is strong again, despite the fierce internal competition (the BYD Seal for the BEV version and the Destroyer 05 for the PHEV version). Expect BYD\u2019s lower priced midsize sedan to continue posting strong results, at the cost of its most expensive siblings. It should have no problem keeping its most direct competitors, the Tesla Model 3 and GAC Aion S, at a safe distance. #3 \u2014 BYD Dolphin The small-to-compact Dolphin scored 31,650 registrations , a new record for the space-efficient EV. In the past, one could say that the Dolphin had its class all to itself, as its most direct competitors in this category were selling significantly fewer units. This success is now being tested by the recently introduced Wuling Bingo, which clocked a record 19,782-unit performance in July. Once the Bingo crosses the 20,000 units/month threshold, it could give the Dolphin a run for its money. The race in the small hatchback category could become even more entertaining to follow if the upcoming JAC Yiwei 3, said to receive sodium-ion batteries later this year , also becomes a success. #4 \u2014 BYD Seagull With 28,100 registrations , in only its third full month on the market, BYD\u2019s future star player is ramping up fast, with the question now being: How high will it go? In its domestic market it should reach podium positions soon, but it is overseas that the little EV could be a true disruptive force: Latin America and Africa are waiting for a good, cheap EV that can push EVs into the mainstream, and the Seagull could be it. And this could be the model that places BYD among the best sellers in places like India or Europe, where good value-for-money BEVs are scarce. Sitting somewhere between the A and B segments, at 3.78 mt, and using a purposeful angular design, it profits from the brand\u2019s leading Blade batteries, in 30 kWh and 39 kWh sizes. It starts at 74,000 CNY (+\\-$10,500 USD). The only model rivaling it is the slightly larger (3.95 mt) Wuling Bingo, which starts at 60,000 CNY (+\\-$8,200 USD), but at that price, it comes with a battery of just 17 kWh and no DC charging. For a similar-spec Bingo, equipped with a 32 kWh battery & DC charging, it starts at 74,000 CNY, the same price as the Seagull. So, spec-wise, both seem equally competitive, but the Seagull benefits from the current strength of the BYD brand, something that the Wuling EV lacks. Also, does SAIC (or GM) have export plans for this small EV? #5 \u2014 Tesla Model Y Tesla\u2019s star model got 24,351 registrations , which was its best first-month-of-quarter market ever in China, so it seems the price cuts continue to spur demand for the US crossover, which might allow it to reach another record month in September. At a time when Chinese automakers are in peak form, Tesla is currently the only foreign OEM able to follow the amazing pace of the domestic carmakers, with the Model Y\u2019s most immediate threat actually coming from its own stable in the form of the refreshed Tesla Model 3. If the price and specs are anywhere near what is being said, expect the sedan to start cannibalizing its crossover sibling during the coming months\u2026. Looking at the rest of the table, the main highlight in the top half is the #9 Wuling Bingo scoring 19,782 sales, its second record performance in a row, not only beating its smaller sibling Wuling Mini EV, but also now looking to break the glass ceiling disrupt the BYD/Tesla duopoly at the top! The Wuling Bingo could reach the sales levels of the category leader, the BYD Dolphin. Further below in the table, a highlight was in #12, with the Changan Lumin scoring a record 15,262 registrations thanks to a recent refresh. Elsewhere, Li Auto placed all three of its models in the top 20, with the L7 five-seater \u2014 the startup\u2019s smallest model (the L9/L8/L7 are all full-size SUVs) \u2014 having another record month (13,389 registrations) while the slightly larger L8 seven-seater also hit a record result, 11,315 units. Even the Cadillac Escalade\u2013like L9 got an amazing 9,425 registrations\u2026. (Last month there were three models larger than 5 meters in the top 20 \u2014 the Li Xiang L9 & L8 as well as the Denza D9. Talk about automotive obesity\u2026.) The hot startup brand has a winner trio on its hands. The cheapest model in the startup\u2019s lineup (starting at $49,000) should continue to improve its standing in the near future, with Li Auto setting a bullish sales target of 400,000 units this year! And 800,000 in 2024!! And 1.6 million in 2025!!! :0 For these targets to be met, the midsize L6, due to be launched sometime next year, will be a critical part of the puzzle. Still on the top 20, three other models deserve a mention. The #15 BYD Destroyer 05, a reskinned BYD Qin Plus PHEV, hit a record 11,994 registrations, its second record performance in a row. In #18, we have NIO\u2019s new generation ES6, which recently landed on the market with a bang. It scored 10,252 registrations in July, the first five-digit performance in a month by any NIO model. Expect the ES6 to resume its role as the bread and butter model, allowing the startup to scale up its (much needed) production. Finally, after a significant price drop, VW ID.3 sales surged in China, allowing the hatchback to reach the top 20 for the first time with a record 9,093 registrations. Who would have imagined \u2014 cutting prices DOES increase sales\u2026. Outside the top 20, the highlights are varied. In Changan\u2019s stable, the Deepal S7 SUV had 7,704 registrations, in only its second month on the market. A future best seller? The Baojun Yep, a recently introduced pint-sized SUV ( think micro Mercedes G-Class ) delivered 5,305 units of its cutesy baby SUV , in only its third month on the market. Will the SGMW joint venture place in the top 20 soon? Meanwhile, Leap Motor\u2019s C11 midsize SUV scored another great performance, 8,298 registrations, no doubt helped by the introduction of a range-extended version that is now sold along with the regular BEV version. The 20 Best Selling Electric Vehicles in China \u2014 January\u2013July 2023 Looking at the 2023 ranking, the BYD Song is well above the competition, while the runner-up BYD Qin Plus has gained precious advantage over the #3 Tesla Model Y. Will the Chinese sedan continue resisting the US crossover\u2019s pressure? Off the podium, the table has remained relatively stable, with the first position change happening in #6 with the GAIC Aion S surpassing the Wuling Mini EV, thus becoming the first of the non-BYD/Tesla models. In the second half of the table, we have the Wuling Bingo climbing one position to #12, while just below it, another small EV is also on the rise \u2014 the Changan Lumin was up to #13. Below these two, we have two new BYD models in the table, with the small Seagull jumping to #15 in July while the Destroyer 05 is now #19. Finally, we must mention the Li Auto models, with the L7 climbing to #17 and the L9 going up to #19. That makes three Li Auto models in the top 20. Apart from the all-mighty BYD, no one else has that many models in the top 20, and it speaks volumes about the startup\u2019s current strength. Top Selling Auto Brands & Auto Groups in Chinese EV Market Looking at the auto brand ranking , there\u2019s no major news. BYD (35.5%, up 0.2%) remains stable in its leadership position and is looking to win its 10th plugin automaker title this year, while off-peak Tesla (8.4%, down from 9.1%) is stable in second place. Third-placed GAC Aion remained stable, at 6.5%, while the SGMW joint venture\u2019s performance recovered slightly, helped by the \u201c Bingo-effect\u201d pulling its share from 5.8% in June to its current 5.9%. Finally, 5th placed Li Auto continues on the rise (4.4%, up from 4.3%). This three-year-old startup is already reaching significant sales levels and looks set to become a force to be reckoned with in the future. Despite staying off the radar of many analysts, Li Auto\u2019s growth potential, price points, and margins are the most promising among current EV startups. Just to put the company\u2019s amazing growth curve into context, in 2015, three years after the Model S launch, Tesla was celebrating a record 50,000 unit sales a year. At the same age, Li Auto does more than that in two months\u2026. This is kind of a perfect s*** storm for legacy OEMs in China, with BYD and GAC going after their mainstream market volumes, Tesla hitting their midsize/premium offers hard, and Li Auto eating its way into the last bastion of profitability for foreign OEMs in China: full size models. Looking at OEMs/automotive groups/alliances , BYD is comfortably leading with 37.3% share of the market, up 0.3% in July, while #2 Tesla (8.4%) also remains stable. With the SAIC mothership still in the red, the new Wuling Bingo helped to stop the current sales bleed \u2014 the Shanghai-based OEM was up from the 7.4% share it held in May to its current 7.5%, which was enough to allow it to retain the last position on the podium. With #4 GAC (6.9%) getting closer, SAIC could have its bronze medal in danger soon. One step down, #5 Geely\u2013Volvo is slowly growing, now at 5.6% share, up 0.1% share compared to the previous month. With #6 Changan stable at 4.5%, Geely can rest on its laurels for now while it looks for a way to surpass SAIC and/or GAC by the end of the year. (And maybe go after Tesla in 2024?)

        "content": "Tesla continues to be the best selling brand in Europe, but Volkswagen is recovering Some 234,000 plugin vehicles were registered in July in Europe \u2014 which is +48% year over year (YoY), the market\u2019s highest growth since August 2021. Unfortunately, the overall market also grew fast, +17%, as it is finally recovering from a couple of bad years. Last month\u2019s plugin vehicle share of the overall European auto market was 23% (15% full electrics/BEVs). That result kept the 2023 plugin vehicle share at 22% (15% for BEVs alone). BEVs kept gaining momentum in July, growing 68% YoY, its biggest growth rate since February \u201922. Meanwhile, PHEVs (+22%, their highest growth rate this year) also had a surprisingly positive result, which means that both technologies are accelerating their adoption rate. With these two powertrains rising, others must come down , and one of them is diesel, which now has only 14% of the European passenger car market, a far cry from the 50% share it had in 2015 or the 55% average it experienced before that. At this rate, in this category, diesel will be dead by 2027, well before the 2035 ICE ban \u2026. The highlight of the month was the Skoda Enyaq jumping into the 3rd spot. But let\u2019s look closer at July\u2019s plugin top 5: #1 Tesla Model Y \u2014 For the 9th month in a row, Tesla\u2019s crossover was the best selling EV in Europe. In July, the midsizer had 11,748 registrations . This year could be considered \u201cPeak Model Y\u201d in Europe. The midsized crossover should continue to post similar results in the coming quarters in Europe \u2014 but do not expect sales to increase significantly over current volumes, as I am confident the Model Y has already reached the market\u2019s natural limits . Also limiting its growth will be the refreshed Tesla Model 3, which might steal some sales from it, even if Europeans aren\u2019t really into sedans these days. Regarding last month\u2019s performance, the Model Y\u2019s biggest European markets included the UK (2,280 units), Germany (2,067 units), and France (1,631 units), with these countries being the ones posting four-digit results. #2 VW ID.4 \u2014 The Volkswagen crossover won another podium position in July thanks to 8,681 registrations . With increased production availability, the ID.4 now has enough firepower to compete for the #2 spot in 2023, looking to improve on the #3 spot it scored last year. But, will the crossover get there? There have been rumors that demand is dropping, so even if VW now has enough production capability to go after the #2 Tesla Model 3, slow demand could prevent it from doing so. Regarding the ID.4\u2019s July performance, its main market was its home market of Germany (2,941 registrations), followed at a distance by the UK (1,050 registrations), and Norway (975 units). #3 Skoda Enyaq \u2014 The Czech crossover is a sure value in the EV arena, and although the VW ID.4 is now the MEB-platform biggest seller, the good looking crossover has managed to end July in a podium position, and with a record performance to boot. The model had 7,228 sales , an amazing performance for the Skoda EV, especially when we consider that July is a holiday month and most of its competitors are taking a vacation and enjoying some pi\u00f1a coladas\u2026. With this in mind, expect sales to continue strong in the coming months, now that the production constraints seem to have (finally!) ended. Regarding the Enyaq\u2019s July results, the distribution of deliveries between markets was pretty balanced, with the bigger market being Germany (1,896 units), followed by the Netherlands (742 units), Norway (724), and the UK (696) #4 MG4 \u2014 The compact hatchback is fulfilling MG\u2019s best expectations, proving right its dragon-slayer nickname and earning another top 5 presence in July thanks to 6,433 registrations . With original looks, good handling, and good enough interior materials, the Sino-British hatchback is sort of the electric Ford Focus that the US brand has refused to make. With Dearborn\u2019s European arm now little more than an extension of the US marketing team (SUVs = Freedom & Americana ), there is a hole in the B and C segments for mainstream hatchbacks with a focus on good handling and smart design. With the MG4 now filling the role of the electric Ford Focus , who will fill the role of the electric Ford Fiesta ? But I digress. Back to the MG4\u2019s July performance. Its main markets were its adopted home market of the UK (1,850 registrations), Germany (1,193 registrations), and France (1,083 registrations), which incidentally are three big markets for hatchbacks. The remaining markets ended at some distance behind, with the 4th best score happening in Ireland , 565 units. This could mean that production is still not enough to satisfy demand and SAIC is still starving secondary markets. #5 Dacia Spring \u2014 Although it didn\u2019t reach record sales levels, the little Sino-Romanian had a positive month, allowing it to beat its Fiat 500e arch rival and win the city car category in July. With 5,986 sales , a new year best, the popular city car is currently Renault\u2019s cash cow in the EV arena. The only Renault showing up on the table was the Megane EV, in #19, selling almost half of what the Dacia EV had. Looking at July\u2019s performance, France (2,127 registrations) and Germany (1,818 registrations) were the biggest markets by far, followed at a distance by its home market of Romania (828 registrations). Looking at the rest of the July table, the highlights are all in the second half of the table. The #15 spot of the Mercedes EQA was celebrated with a year-best performance from the German model, 3,673 registrations, ending the month above its arch rival, the BMW iX1, which was #16 with 3,454 registrations, again beating the i4 as the highest placed BMW on the table. The second half of the table also witnessed record performances, like the BMW iX1 scoring its second record result in a row, this time 4,158 registrations. That put it in 16th. It is interesting to see that the best selling models from the \u201cThree Marys\u201d (BMW, Mercedes, and Audi) are their compact crossovers (BMW iX1, Mercedes EQA, and Audi Q4 e-tron), which says a lot about current market trends. But it also says a lot about the black hole effect that Teslas are making in the midsize market, stealing sales left and right from the premium German automakers. Will this be just a phase, followed by a bounce back from the Three Marys in a few years, or have they lost their customer base for good? I guess the IAA might start providing some answers\u2026. Below the top 20, we had several models with positive performances, like the VW ID.5 reaching 2,477 registrations. In the full size category, the Audi Q8 e-tron continued to remain in charge, thanks to July\u2019s 2,523 registrations. There was also good news in the Hyundai\u2013Kia stable, with the Hyundai Ioniq 5 (2,801 units) and Kia EV6 (3,240) helping their respective makes with solid results. The BYD Atto 3 (export spec BYD Yuan Plus) had its best score this year, 1,643 registrations. Has BYD finally started to deliver in European markets with relevant volumes? Finally, in the Stellantis stable, despite weak results from its best sellers \u2014 the Fiat 500e was only 8th, while the Peugeot e-208 didn\u2019t even make the top 20 \u2014 the Stellantis highlight this month came from Jeep, with the little Avenger EV scoring 1,455 deliveries in only its third month on the market. Expect for the Polish-made American model to start knocking at the door of the top 20 in a few months. Looking at the 2023 ranking , with the Tesla Model Y having three times as many deliveries as the new runner-up VW ID.4, the attention is now focused on the remaining podium positions. On that topic, the VW ID.4 jumped two positions in July, to 2nd place, removing the Model 3 from the silver medal spot. If the upcoming refresh of the Tesla sedan is as disruptive as rumors say it will be, namely price-wise, then the German crossover will have a hard time holding onto silver. Speaking about the #4 Volvo XC40, it is probably already suffering from the comparison with Volvo\u2019s newborn EX30, of which its 7th position in July could be an early sign of fatigue and future cannibalization. Elsewhere, let\u2019s look at the remaining position changes. The MG4 continues to climb up the table, having risen two positions in July to #6, immediately followed by another value-for-money champ , the Skoda Enyaq, which jumped from 9th in June to 7th now. (And what do you know \u2014 apparently there is a market for EVs that focus on value for money. Well, color me amazed!) The Ford Kuga PHEV was up one position, to #11, while its direct competitor, the Kia Niro, also climbed up the table \u2014 in this case, to #14. In the last positions of the table, the highlight is the rise of the Polestar 2, which was up to #17 and now has its sights set on the #16 BMW i4. So, not only us the i4 having its derri\u00e8re kicked by the Tesla Model 3, but now it is seeing the Polestar 2 coming closer and closer. And let\u2019s not forget that the Kia EV6 (#21) and Hyundai Ioniq 5 (#25) aren\u2019t that far behind either\u2026. (Well, at least BMW is trying, even if the i4 is just a placeholder model. Mercedes will only come to play next year \u2014 with the new CLA \u2014 while Audi is only bringing the A4 e-tron to market \u2026 in 2026.) Still in the top 20, the Cupra Born was up to #18. We can also celebrate the arrival of the Mercedes EQA onto the table, in #20, but the three-pointed-star model cannot rest on its laurels, because the arch rival BMW iX1 (in #22) is also rising and could surpass it soon. In the auto brand ranking , Tesla is leading with a comfortable 12.31% share of the plugin market, down 0.8% compared to its peak in June. Volkswagen is in the runner-up position with 8.6%, up 0.1% compared to the previous month. 3rd placed BMW (8%, up from 7.9%) has kept its lead over Mercedes (7.5%, up from 7.4%), but with only 0.5% share separating the two, a lot can still happen between them. Finally, Volvo (6.1%, down from 6.2%) is still comfortable in 5th but is losing share by the day. So, we might see #6 Audi (5.4%, up from 5.3% in June) surpass it sometime in the future. Arranging things by automotive group , Volkswagen Group was up to 20.3%, from 19.9% in June, keeping a comfortable lead over runner-up Stellantis (14.1%, down 0.2% from the previous month). Off-peak Tesla dropped from 13.1% to 12.3%, but expect the US automaker to try and go after the #2 position in September, looking to profit from Stellantis\u2019 apparent weakness. Off the podium, #4 BMW Group was up to 9.6%, while #5 Geely\u2013Volvo suffered from the poor performance from Volvo and dropped 0.1% share, to 8.7%. With #6 Mercedes-Benz Group (8.4%, up from 8.3%) and #7 Hyundai\u2013Kia (8.3%, up 0.1%) on the rise, Geely might be ousted from its 5th spot in the next few months.

        "content": "Half the fun of investing in stocks is digging through the markets to find undervalued gems and under-the-radar stocks with long-term potential. At the same time, markets are complex and the depth of information available is overwhelming. \u201cParalysis by analysis\u201d is a real affliction. It particularly affects newer investors as they learn how to separate the wheat from the chaff in under-the-radar stocks. As with any long-term investment strategy, three things matter. First, consider the broad economic conditions. Today, in an era of high(ish) interest rates and economic uncertainty, growth stocks and tech stocks are struggling. Depending on your risk appetite, this can present an opportunity to buy great stocks at bargain prices. Second, underlying fundamentals and financials matter \u2013 particularly in a tight economy. If a company can\u2019t withstand brief uncertainty based on its current financials, it doesn\u2019t matter how great its potential is. To that end, consider the long-term potential. Does the company have a viable product or service that\u2019s in demand and fairly protected from competition? These three companies have fundamental strength and long-term viability to weather (or even thrive) in today\u2019s economy. Each represents a perfect under-the-radar stock for those hunting for overlooked treasure. Under-the-Radar Stocks: Howmet Aerospace (HWM) Howmet Aerospace (NYSE: HWM ) is an aerospace company that manufactures and produces various materials and components for aircraft and aerospace end items. Of course, with space stocks set to hit a net value between $1 trillion and $10 trillion in the next few years, Howmet\u2019s long-term viability as a partner to major aerospace companies is clear. Today, Howmet ensures operational success through diversified products in the trucking industry. As global companies race to tighten up strained supply lines, trucking is a vital link in the chain. Likewise, by producing components for the trucks themselves, Howmet is vital to operational success even as trucking companies pivot to unmanned and autonomous operations . Howmet is financially successful and posted a profit in each of the past three years , with its most recent quarter marking a record $193 million net income . Its cash balance is also healthy, and the aerospace company has enough money to weather occasional down periods if they arise. SharkNinja (SN) SharkNinja (NYSE: SN ) is the definition of an under-the-radar stock, as it snuck onto exchanges via a spinoff in July to limited investor attention. The company might not be at the top of market players\u2019 minds, but it\u2019s a staple in kitchens and homes globally. The company makes and sells a range of appliances, including coffee makers, ice cream machines and hair dryers. Although firmly within consumer discretionary categories, the sluggish economy hasn\u2019t slowed SharkNinja. Instead, the company\u2019s sales have risen 20% each year since 2008. This year, management expects the trends to continue as trends point to $4 billion in revenue by December. Shares trade at a discount compared to similar, semi-luxury appliance brand competitors. Institutional investors are slowly taking note because of the company\u2019s broad appeal, proven strategy and financial readiness. One portfolio manager from Madison Avenue Partners said that SharkNinja is \u201ca gem that\u2019s about to be discovered,\u201d because \u201cSharkNinja has been able to produce new products in categories that haven\u2019t seen much innovation at attractive prices that delight consumers.\u201d Ultimately, any company able to sell higher-end discretionary products in today\u2019s economy is noteworthy. SharkNinja\u2019s success points to long-term upside potential for this under-the-radar stock. Robert Half Inc (RHI) The global job and labor market is changing, and firms like staffing agency Robert Half Inc (NYSE: RHI ) are positioned to ride the new trend to success. Notably, the company is pivoting away from low-margin activities, like temporary staffing solutions, and rotating into long-term contract sourcing. Notably, contract-to-hire models represent much higher margins for Robert Half. At the same time, they ensure a long-term revenue stream as the client and contractor\u2019s relationship matures. Likewise, these roles open opportunities for Robert Half to partner with more professional, skilled and experienced contractors. Ultimately, the move increases value to the client\u2019s organization and cements RHI\u2019s position in their workflow. Small business outsourcing is already booming, and digitization means Robert Half can deliver expertise to small business owners globally, no matter how remote the business is or how lacking local talent pools are. This demand makes matchmaking essential, and Robert Half is particularly well-suited to capitalize on emerging trends. This company and the ones listed above are all under-the-radar stocks that you should consider for your portfolio.

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips GameStop chairman Ryan Cohen is being investigated by the SEC. Here's why this probe could lead to dark days ahead for GME stock. The post GME Stock Alert: Why Is GameStop Down Today? appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Earlier this week, GameStop (NYSE: GME ) reported second-quarter earnings, beating analyst estimates on sales growth and pushing up GME stock in the process. But the momentum hasn\u2019t lasted. Instead, today brings reports that Executive Chairman Ryan Cohen is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Of course, this SEC probe has nothing directly to do with GameStop. Rather, it concerns another popular meme stock: Bed Bath & Beyond (OTCMKTS: BBBYQ ). When Cohen abruptly decided to cash out of his large Bed Bath stake in August 2022 \u2014 walking away with $68 million in profits \u2014 the news sent shares crashing. Now, the regulatory agency is looking into the sale as well as Cohen, the infamous \u201cmeme stock king.\u201d Let\u2019s take a closer look at how this could impact GME stock in the months to come \u2014 and assess what investors can expect. What\u2019s Happening With GME Stock? Even with the recent earnings bump, GME stock has struggled significantly this week. Today, shares closed down by about 6%. The Ryan Cohen SEC probe may not be the only reason for these declines, but it certainly isn\u2019t helping things. As InvestorPlace contributor Dana Blankenhorn reports , GameStop now trades \u201cbased on its fundamentals as a no-growth and marginally profitable retailer.\u201d That\u2019s concerning enough on its own. But with Cohen\u2019s legal problems causing further uncertainty, investors will have even more reason to approach shares with caution. The fact that both GME stock and fellow meme favorite AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC ) are falling amid the probe news should remind investors just how unstable meme stocks can be. Last August, Bed Bath & Beyond had surged to impressive heights on short squeeze momentum. When Cohen offloaded his massive stake in the company, though, it shocked markets. This quickly led to an outcry from investors and attempts at legal action . The Wall Street Journal reports: WSJ also notes that SEC investigations can be long and complicated. While GME stock may bounce back from the current downward momentum on retail investing energy, some institutional investors may be liable to jump ship. All of this suggests that darker days are ahead for the video game retailer. Despite its forays into non-fungible token (NFT) markets, among other fields, it\u2019s important to remember: At its core, GameStop is a plastic disc retailer with an outdated business model. Now, investors have even more reason to run the other way before shares fall further. Regardless of what the probe turns up, Cohen\u2019s credibility is also at risk of being compromised. On the date of publication, Samuel O\u2019Brient did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "I took a chance on purchasing a no-frills \u00a312 tether cable to see how it performs in comparison to other well-known brand cables. If you shoot tethered, you might want to read on. The pursuit of perfection often leads us down the path of expensive gear and accessories, which can eat into a photographer's profit margins. One such accessory is the tether shooting cable, an indispensable tool for photographers looking to maximize their workflow and shooting process. I don\u2019t know about you, but tether cables and reflectors are high on my danger list of items that I seem to leave behind after a shoot. I am forever replacing them, so if there is a good option at a lower cost, I\u2019m willing to give it a try. As it stands, a certain orange-colored tether cable dominates the market, commanding premium prices for this useful piece of kit, which, depending on the area of photography you practice in, may or may not be considered an essential tool. In contrast to this, the Valueline tether shooting cable, in a bright shade of blue, caught my attention as a cost-effective alternative to the orange-clad name-brand cables, which cost an average of \u00a350. Skeptical but curious, I decided to give it a shot, and the results left me pleasantly surprised. You may have noticed this yourself, but when the word photography is added to the description of a product, the price tends to creep up. This is not advertised as being a photographic tether cable, but that is exactly what it is, and tethering your camera for instant image review on a monitor is exactly what it does. Of course, different connections are available for different camera and monitor or laptop connections, but throughout all options, the price stays very low. I paid \u00a311.86 for this cable, but it is currently on offer for \u00a39.92, and I will be purchasing a spare as soon as I finish typing this article. Shooting tethered, the practice of connecting your camera to a computer or monitor during a photoshoot, offers numerous advantages that enhance a photographer's workflow. Here are some key benefits: Shooting tethered enables instant viewing of images on a larger screen, allowing for a more accurate assessment of composition, exposure, and focus. The larger screen helps identify and address any issues with images that might go unnoticed on the small LCD on the back of your camera. Clients, art directors, or models can view images as they are captured, fostering better communication and collaboration on set. Images are transferred directly to the computer, reducing the risk of data loss due to memory card failure. Photographers can make real-time adjustments to camera settings from the computer, streamlining the creative process. After a fortnight of use, this cable has delivered exceptional performance without burning a hole in my pocket. Priced at a fraction of the cost of the orange cables, this budget-friendly option allows photographers to allocate their resources elsewhere. This article is a rather long way to say \u201cit works.\u201d Granted, I have only used it over the course of a few weeks, but it has already outlasted one of the more costly tether cables I purchased a few years back that kept disconnecting after only a few weeks of use. A final point to consider, which may be a minor point, is that other professionals will recognize the color as being out of place with what they are used to seeing. Will this give an impression of inferiority? It shouldn\u2019t, but would you judge a person\u2019s professionalism if they are using an off-brand data transfer cable? In a world where quality need not always come at a premium, this cable serves as a testament to the value that can occasionally be found in affordable solutions. If you are anything like me, you will need a spare for occasions when you leave your cable behind, or if your cable malfunctions, so at the very least this will be an ideal option in that scenario. If you're in the market for a reliable and cost-effective tether shooting cable, don't hesitate to give the brand a try; you might just find yourself as pleasantly surprised as I was.

        "content": "Forbes Leadership ForbesWomen Plus-Size CEO Of Noir Fashion Week Rethinks New York Fashion Week Virgie Tovar Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Following Sep 8, 2023, 04:53pm EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Nichole M. Bess, CEO of Noir Fashion Week, and Dr. Courtney A. Hammonds at Spring 2023 event ... [+] \"Cocktails and Conversations\" held in Manhattan Fashinnovation As we head into New York Fashion Week (NYFW), let\u2019s hope that things are looking better than last season when it comes to body size representation. Back in Spring, NYFW was getting called out for some of the lowest plus-size visibility on the runway in recent history. Meanwhile Noir Fashion Week (NFW) was highlighting underrepresented designers - and underrepresented bodies - at the very same time in New York. Nichole M. Bess is the founder of Noir Fashion Week. She sees her brainchild as a response to the lack of diversity in the fashion world broadly and at NYFW specifically. Bess says that NFW is a platform for the \u201coverlooked and what some would deem as underqualified. I see NFW as an opportunity to uncover the diamond in the ruff.\u201d Noir Fashion Week was built on Bess\u2019 love of fashion and her drive to give global visibility to marginalized people. At 19, Bess was interning with Russell and Kimora Lee Simmons as a fashion designer. They later introduced her to Naomi Campbell, which ultimately led to a pivot into public relations. \u201cI started my own PR firm right before my 20th birthday,\u201d shares Bess. \u201cAs I was studying to become a fashion designer, I found a love for making dreams come true through the power of media visibility and storytelling. As a budding publicist I knew this was why I was created. I committed full-time to this newfound passion and went all in. I booked clients like Wolford, Saks Fifth Avenue, Betsey Johnson , Agatha of Paris, Deon and Pilar Sanders and many more.\u201d Bess says she hopes that NFW will outlive her and become known as the springboard to careers like those of her mentors, Christopher John Rogers , Fe Noel and LaQaun Smith , who in 2022 became the first to stage a fashion show inside the Empire State Building. Though NYFW began in 1943, it became the fashion week we know today 50 years later under the banner of the Council of Fashion Designers of America . The lack of BIPOC representation among NYFW designers and models has received extensive critique, pointing to the fact that even when these designers get shows they receive less media coverage and fewer resources . Bess says she sees NFW as a \u201cstop gap\u201d and \u201cthe bridge between the dream and a new reality.\u201d She believes that part of the problem with the fashion world is that BIPOC designers are often unable to afford a well-rounded fashion education or haven\u2019t been equipped with the professional tools they need to take their talent to the next level. She has plans to solve for some of these challenges by launching a non-profit organization that will assist in locating grants, classes, books and international studies for emerging BIPOC designers globally.

Even if \u2018they\u2019 have their nose turned up at you, they still want to know who and why you are. As the fashion industry continues to expand and become more accepting of women like me, we have increasingly more options for both style and comfort,\u201d says Bess. \u201cI lean into the lessons my mother taught me, and always know I reign supreme.\u201d Fashinnovation is a global platform connecting the fashion and tech industries through conferences and events, and is a NFW partner. Jordana Guimar\u00e3es , Co-founder of Fashinnovation, says she was eager to support NFW when she found out about Bess in 2022. She believes that the fashion industry needs to talk less and do more when it comes to diversity, equity and inclusion. \u201c(Things) needs to change if we're going to see the future we want in fashion,\u201d says Guimar\u00e3es. \u201cEveryone deserves to see themselves in fashion. Noir Fashion Week is creating a model that deserves emulation and gives the fashion world hope.\u201d Virgie Tovar Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions",

        "description": "Short Crypto: A Comprehensive Guide on How to Short Crypto in the United States? Cryptocurrencies have become a\u2026",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have become a prominent investment strategy for many traders, but what if you believe that the price of a particular cryptocurrency, such as , is likely to decline? In that case, shorting crypto might be a strategy worth considering. Shorting, also known as short selling, allows traders to profit from a cryptocurrency\u2019s price decline. This comprehensive guide will explore a common question: \u201cHow to Short Crypto in the United States?\u201d However, it is important to understand the risks associated with shorting before diving into this investment strategy. Shorting crypto involves borrowing a cryptocurrency and selling it at the current market price, intending to repurchase it at a lower price in the future. The difference between the selling and repurchase prices is the trader\u2019s profit. Shorting can be done through various methods, including margin trading, futures trading, and perpetual contracts. How to Short Crypto in the United States? Margin trading is one of the easiest ways to short crypto. It involves borrowing funds from a broker or a cryptocurrency exchange to make a trade. With margin trading, traders can open larger positions and potentially increase their profits. Many exchanges and brokerages offer margin trading options, including popular platforms like Kraken and Binance. To short crypto through margin trading, traders need to open a margin trading account with a platform that supports this feature. They can then borrow funds from the platform to sell the desired cryptocurrency. If the cryptocurrency\u2019s price decreases, traders can repurchase it at a lower price, return the borrowed funds, and keep the difference as profit. It\u2019s important to note that margin trading involves leverage, which amplifies profits and losses. Traders should carefully manage their positions and use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Futures trading is another method for shorting crypto. In futures trading, buyers agree to purchase a cryptocurrency at a specified price and time. On the other hand, sellers agree to sell the cryptocurrency at the specified price and time. If a trader believes that the price of a cryptocurrency will decline, they can sell futures contracts to profit from the expected price decrease. The futures market for Bitcoin has grown significantly in recent years, with various platforms offering Bitcoin futures trading. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), one of the largest derivatives trading platforms, provides Bitcoin futures contracts. Additionally, cryptocurrency exchanges like Kraken and BitMEX also offer futures trading options. Traders can short crypto by selling Bitcoin futures contracts, betting on a lower price for the cryptocurrency in the future. If the price decreases as predicted, traders can buy back the futures contracts at a lower price, realizing a profit. Perpetual contracts are similar to futures contracts but do not have a fixed expiration date. These contracts are designed to continuously track the price of an underlying asset. Traders can use perpetual contracts to short crypto by selling the contracts and repurchasing them at a lower price. Platforms like Covo Finance offer decentralized trading of perpetual contracts, allowing traders to open and close leveraged positions on various cryptocurrencies. Covo Finance does not require users to deposit their assets and offers up to 50X leverage on crypto perpetual. Traders can select \u201clong\u201d or \u201cshort\u201d positions, depending on whether they expect the price to go up or down. Covo Finance charges trading and borrowing fees, which are deducted at the start of every hour. Now that we have a basic understanding of shorting crypto, let\u2019s explore some popular methods and platforms for shorting cryptocurrencies. Binance is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world and offers margin trading options for traders. Through Binance\u2019s margin trading platform, users can borrow funds to open larger positions and potentially profit from price declines. To short crypto on Binance, traders must open a margin trading account and deposit funds. They can then borrow funds and sell the desired cryptocurrency. If the price decreases, traders can repurchase the cryptocurrency at a lower price, return the borrowed funds, and keep the difference as profit. Binance offers a variety of trading pairs and supports up to 100x leverage for margin trading. However, it\u2019s important to note that margin trading involves higher risks, as leverage can amplify gains and losses. Traders should carefully manage their positions and set stop-loss orders to mitigate potential losses. Kraken is another popular platform that allows traders to short crypto through futures trading. Kraken offers Bitcoin futures contracts, which traders can sell to profit from anticipated price declines. To short crypto on Kraken, traders must open a futures trading account and deposit funds. They can then sell Bitcoin futures contracts, betting on a lower price for the cryptocurrency. If the price decreases as predicted, traders can repurchase the futures contracts at a lower price, realizing a profit. Kraken charges spot fees, opening fees, and rollover fees for futures trading. Traders should carefully consider these fees and manage their positions accordingly. Covo Finance is a decentralized trading platform that offers perpetual contracts for shorting crypto. Traders can open and close leveraged positions on various cryptocurrencies without depositing their assets. To short crypto on Covo Finance, traders can select \u201cshort\u201d positions on the platform and sell perpetual contracts. If cryptocurrency prices decrease, traders can repurchase the contracts at a lower price, realizing a profit. Covo Finance charges trading fees and borrowing fees for perpetual contracts. Traders should carefully monitor their positions and manage their leverage to mitigate potential losses. Binary options trading is another method for shorting crypto. It involves executing put orders, allowing traders to sell a cryptocurrency at today\u2019s price even if the price drops. Several offshore exchanges offer binary option trading for cryptocurrencies. Traders can purchase put options and profit if the cryptocurrency price decreases as expected. However, it\u2019s important to note that binary options trading can be costly and risky. Traders should consider the costs and risks involved before using this method. Prediction markets provide another avenue for shorting crypto. In prediction markets, traders can place bets on the outcome of events, including the price movement of cryptocurrencies. Traders can predict that the price of a cryptocurrency will decline by a certain margin or percentage. If someone takes up the bet, the trader profits if the prediction comes true. Popular crypto prediction markets include Augur, GnosisDAO, and Polymarket. Traders should carefully assess the market conditions and make informed predictions before engaging in prediction market trading. Before deciding to short crypto, it\u2019s essential to understand the risks associated with this investment strategy. Shorting involves predicting the price movement of cryptocurrencies, which can be highly volatile and unpredictable. Here are some important considerations and risks to keep in mind: Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are known for their volatility. Prices can experience significant fluctuations, making it challenging to predict price movements accurately. Traders should be prepared for sudden increases or decreases in the price of cryptocurrencies when shorting. The regulatory status of cryptocurrencies, including their shorting options, varies across jurisdictions. Some platforms and trading options might not be available or regulated in certain countries. Traders should know the regulatory landscape and ensure compliance with local laws when shorting crypto. Margin and futures trading involve leverage, which can amplify profits and losses. While leverage can increase potential gains, it also increases the risk of significant losses. Traders should carefully manage their positions, set stop-loss orders, and only use the leverage they can afford to lose. Cryptocurrency markets are still evolving, and the regulatory framework is not yet fully established. Some platforms might not offer the same level of legal protection as traditional financial markets. Traders should know the limited legal recourse available in disputes or losses. Understanding different order types, such as stop-limit orders, is crucial when shorting crypto. These order types can help limit losses if price trajectories do not align with initial predictions. Traders should familiarize themselves with order types and use them effectively to manage their positions. : How to Short Crypto in the United States? In conclusion, shorting crypto can be an attractive investment strategy for traders who believe that the price of a particular cryptocurrency will decline. However, it is essential to understand the risks involved and carefully manage positions when engaging in shorting activities. Especially when asking the core question, \u201cHow to Short Crypto in the United States?\u201d Various methods and platforms are available for shorting crypto, including margin trading, futures trading, perpetual contracts, binary options trading, and prediction markets. Traders should choose the method and platform that best suits their needs and risk tolerance. Conduct thorough research, analyze market conditions, and make informed predictions before shorting crypto. Furthermore, it is always important to stay updated with the latest cryptocurrency market developments and seek professional advice if needed. Shorting crypto can be a potentially profitable strategy, but it requires careful consideration and risk management. By understanding the dynamics of shorting and utilizing the available tools and platforms, traders can confidently navigate the crypto markets and make informed decisions about their investments.",

        "content": "Here's what to know about the biggest elections in Russia since Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine. As millions of Russians go to the polls for regional elections that wrap up on Sept. 10, there is little doubt that President Vladimir Putin's party, United Russia, will win the vast majority of contests. But the tightly controlled vote will still be interpreted as a test of confidence for the beleaguered strongman, who in late June survived the biggest challenge to his 23 years in power during the Wagner rebellion. Pressure has been building up on the Kremlin since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has upended the Russian economy, not to mention causing the deaths of thousands of Russian soldiers. U.S. officials have estimated that Russia's military casualties are approaching 300,000. The war in Ukraine is also increasingly coming home to Russia, including Moscow, with at least 190 suspected drone attacks hitting the country and Russian-occupied Crimea. In recent years, and especially following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the country's remaining opposition figures have largely been cowed, exiled, or jailed. Critical media have packed up or been shut down by the Kremlin, and human rights organizations have been disbanded. There likely won't be the surprises seen in the last round of local elections, in 2018, that saw United Russia lose four gubernatorial races. Even so, the vote remain an important moment for both Putin, who is hoping to shore up his legitimacy within Russia, and for Russia's opposition, which is hoping to retain their last toeholds in Russian politics. \"The Kremlin is very worried about the outcome of these elections,\" says Regina Smyth, a professor at Indiana University whose research focuses on Russia. Below, what to know about the vote. What's at stake? The elections will take place in about half of Russia, plus the four occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia as well as Russian-annexed Crimea. Over 4,000 contests are being held for a range of positions including governors, mayors, and\u2026 Mathias Hammer",

        "description": "Majority control of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives will once again come down to a special election",
        "content": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) \u2014 Photos PAGP501-504 Majority control of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives will again come down to a special later this month, when Republican voters attempt to flip power back to their caucus while facing a strongly Democratic lean in a Pittsburgh district. The race pits a former Democratic congressional staffer against the daughter of two local officials who were politically active. Democrat Lindsay Powell, 32, and Republican Erin Connolly Autenreith, 65, will face off for the Allegheny County state House seat on Sept. 19, one week before the chamber is scheduled to return to floor session in Harrisburg. They are vying to replace a progressive Democrat, former state Rep. Sara Innamorato, who resigned in July to seek the county executive job. Her departure left the House at a 101-101 tie. The district is a Democratic stronghold Democratic strategists predict their party will be able to retain. A previous special election in which the Republican candidate lost by a wide margin may be why the GOP hasn\u2019t drained its coffers to try to flip the seat, said Trevor Southerland, House Democratic campaign strategist. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a special (election), it would be easier for them to do in a general, but they\u2019d have to be up on TV, they\u2019d have to have an army of field organizers knocking on doors, ton of mailers and digital ads,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just not seeing that.\u201d Republicans in Allegheny County know they are fighting an uphill battle. \u201cEven in a regular election year, it would be very, very difficult for a Republican to win this. However it remains to be seen how the electorate feels,\u201d said Sam DeMarco, chair of the Republican Committee of Allegheny County, adding that Autenreith \"is working very hard.\u201d Powell is seeking office for the first time but jokes she has worked in every job in government except for the one she is seeking. She previously worked as an aide to U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer and U.S. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, both New York Democrats. Constituents say they want more affordable housing, a strong local economy and improved community assets, Powell said. \u201cPeople are concerned about making sure they can stay in their community and make Pittsburgh home, and keep Pittsburgh home,\u201d she said. Several Democrat-led initiatives, such as whole home repair and broader protections for + people, were critical pieces of legislation that didn\u2019t move until Democrats reclaimed control of the state House earlier this year, she said. \u201cWe won\u2019t continue to see this progress if we don\u2019t retain it,\u201d Powell said. Democrats barely flipped the number of districts needed to control the House in November. It was their first claim to the majority in 12 years, with a 102-101 margin they have since maintained through several special elections. Having first-year Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro in office has aided their agenda. This year, Democrats have used their newfound power to advance a number of the caucus\u2019 priorities. But the Legislature remains politically divided, with a firm Republican majority in the Senate that has sought to advance its own priorities, including school vouchers and constitutional amendments. Passing such measures would be easier with a favorable House. Autenreith's potential election, flipping party control to the Republicans, would not change things very much in the Capitol, she said. \u201cI think it would boost the Republican Party, of course, but that\u2019s not the reason I\u2019m running,\u201d she said. Autenreith comes from a political background: Her father was a mayor of McKees Rocks near Pittsburgh and her mother served on a borough council. She previously ran for the state House in 2000 but lost to the Democrat seeking reelection. Autenreith currently serves as Republican committee chair in Shaler. Education is a central political issue for her, she said. Autenreith supports vouchers for private school and said she thinks education is vital to get at other challenges facing the district, including housing and crime. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a shift in this country in the next year or two because it\u2019s hit a boiling point,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to live like this, live to be afraid to go downtown, to go to major events.\u201d The House isn\u2019t due back until a week after the special election decides the fate of the majority, leaving aspects of the final state budget undone. Innamorato\u2019s departure makes advancing measures on party-line votes more difficult for Democrats. Innamorato won a contested Democratic primary for Allegheny\u2019s county executive in May as part of a progressive slate in local elections. She will face the lone Republican primary contender, Joseph Rockey, in the November general election. Another Democratic state representative, longtime Bucks County incumbent John Galloway, is running for district judge, meaning early next year the Democrats will likely face another race in which their majority is at stake. ___ Brooke Schultz is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Mitt Romney (R-UT) for colluding with the \u201cMcConnell-Schumer cabal\u201d during an appearance on Sirius XM\u2019s Breitbart News Saturday . Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle noted that after Staggs blasted Romney in a July interview for not spending much time in Utah, Romney has recently begun events in his home state. LISTEN : \u201cWe, the power of Breitbart, and your program here and just calling him out because that has been a great concern,\u201d Staggs told Boyle. \u201cThe voting record is one thing, and so many Utahns are just completely opposede Jhe to his policies and the support of that Biden agenda.\u201d Staggs said it is \u201cquite ironic\u201d that Romney \u201csuddenly\u201d showed up in Utah. Boyle then mentioned that Utah Sen. Mike Lee (R) called for new Republican leadership in the Senate and asked Staggs if he supports Lee\u2019s position. \u201cI agree. 100 percent,\u201d Staggs said about wanting new Republican leadership in the Senate. \u201cI support Mike Lee in this and you\u2019re right. He\u2019s just been fantastic. He\u2019s exhibited leadership. It\u2019s what we need. I mean, we need adults in Washington, DC, that that are more interested in advancing the interests of the American public\u2014 those whom they\u2019re supposed to represent\u2014than going out there and trying to perpetuate the status quo \u2013 the establishment that unfortunately, they have demonstrated they represent,\u201d Staggs said. Staggs called out Romney for \u201calready signaling defeat\u201d weeks out from the end of the fiscal year, which will bring negotiations about funding the federal government. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, listens to reporters following a roundtable discussion at Intermountain Primary Children\u2019s Hospital with officials and health experts to receive an update on anti-vaping efforts Thursday, Oct. 10, 2019, in Salt Lake City. In his first public appearance since President Donald Trump unleashed a storm of insults on Twitter, Romney stuck by his criticism of Trump\u2019s actions but said he expects him to re-elected. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer) \u201cAnd people like Mitt Romney already signaling defeat. \u2018Oh, no, we can\u2019t. We definitely have to pass a continuing resolution. We can\u2019t just let the government shut down.\u2019 And, and you just lose all your negotiating leverage day one,\u201d Staggs said. \u201cWe need some true leaders. Mike Lee, Senator Lee has demonstrated that on this issue.\u201d Staggs said Romney \u201cjust hasn\u2019t demonstrated leadership where it needs to be in pushing back against the establishment changing the status quo so it actually improves the lot of everyday Americans.\u201d \u201cSo I don\u2019t expect that we\u2019ll see anything other than him continuing to collude with, yes, sadly, the McConnell-Schumer, Cabal,\u201d Staggs said of Romney.

But you\u2019re right. I mean, the compassionate thing to do here, and the adult thing to do, is to have a conversation with him and in and just say, hey, it\u2019s time to pass the torch.

        "description": "Mayor Eric Adams sounded the alarm this week over the financial strain his city faces as thousands of asylum seekers arrive each month.",
        "content": "Can New York be saved? The fundamental question is on the table thanks to Mayor Adams . His warning that the asylum-seeking migrant throng \u201cwill destroy New York City\u201d makes this a five-alarm moment. Adams is late to the party with his realization, which should have been obvious the moment President Biden threw open the southern border and the first batches of illegal crossers landed in Manhattan. Why the mayor hesitated to sound the big alarm until 110,000 arrived here, with 60,000 living at taxpayer expense, is beyond comprehension. What took him so damn long? Part of the answer is that Adams is notoriously inconsistent and has been on both sides of the migrant fence. He was initially boastful about welcoming them to his sanctuary city and helped arrange transportation for some with the Democratic mayor of El Paso, Texas, even as he denounced the Republican governor of Texas as a racist for sending bus caravans to New York (at the Port Authority, right) and other cities with black mayors. To complete the circle of double talk, Adams tried exporting buses full of migrants to the suburbs, where most were turned back. Leaders there don\u2019t want any part of New York\u2019s disaster. As for his day job, City Hall\u2019s role seems to consist mostly of opening new sites \u2014 the latest count is more than 200 \u2014 to accommodate all new arrivals. In addition to the exorbitant cost of taking over entire hotels and outfitting other large buildings, there is food, health care, transportation, education \u2014 all of which leads to his estimate that the tab will hit an astonishing $12 billion over three years. On Saturday, the mayor announced cuts to other agencies, saying they must trim their spending by 5% to offset the ballooning migrant costs. His failures aside, Adams is spot on with his warning about the situation and those who care about New York should be grateful for his candor, belated though it is. Accusations from the left that he is fear-mongering are technically correct, but miss the point. Fear is the right reaction to a problem of this magnitude. The staggering cost means taxpayers will get far less bang for their bucks. Tax hikes are inevitable, giving more fuel to the exodus of fed-up New Yorkers fleeing to lower-cost, safer and saner destinations. While it is tempting to give up on Adams, he still has more than two years left in his term to right the ship. Besides, no credible alternative has stepped forward with a plan. Any would-be saviors better also have a plan to fix everything else, too, because the city was teetering even before those first migrant buses got here. Name a topic and you\u2019ve named a major problem. Crime, public disorder, failing schools, taxes, transportation, cost of living, utilities, infrastructure \u2014 the city is drowning. Those with any knowledge of history will say it faced a death rattle before and leaders emerged to guide it to greener pastures. And it\u2019s true that in the last 50 years, Ed Koch, Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg did just that, even though none was considered a likely hero. Even the seemingly unbearable horrors of 9/11 were overcome. But two essential ingredients from those days are missing now. One is a viable two-party system and the other is a decisive number of centrist, swing voters. Republican Lee Zeldin\u2019s failed campaign for governor last year helped the GOP pick up enough seats to provide a slim House majority, but he scored just 30% of the vote in the five boroughs, an indication of why Republicans are not a factor in day-to-day governance. Dems also hold every statewide elective office and control the leadership of all major cities. They have veto-proof majorities in the City Council and Legislature. In fact, New York is such a one-party hot house that the Manhattan district attorney and the state attorney general waded into national politics by filing tendentious charges against Donald Trump . Perhaps most important, the council and both chambers in Albany are controlled not just by Democrats, but by the party\u2019s radical left wing. To survive, more moderate Dems, including Adams and Gov. Hochul , have mostly surrendered to the radicals\u2019 agenda, meaning the center of political gravity has shifted significantly left in the last 20 years. To be sure, Koch was a Dem, but as he liked to say, \u201ca liberal with sanity.\u201d Giuliani and Bloomberg were Republicans, and given the lopsided count of registered voters and the far-left\u2019s dominance, it\u2019s unlikely either man could be elected today. The tilted landscape gives Adams and Hochul very short policy leashes and neither has been consistently able to set the agenda. It\u2019s also true that they have not figured out how to leverage the power they have, including how to get the attention of a Democratic White House about the migrant catastrophe. If a Republican president harmed New York by opening the border and stood silent as millions poured across, they would have raged on endlessly and rallied voters to punish the president\u2019s party. But with a president of their own party, they have been loyal to a fault, complaining only because Washington won\u2019t chip in enough money to pay for the crisis it created. Neither demands that Biden secure the border. Even worse, the mayor and governor united around the terrible idea of demanding rapid work permits for the migrants, and pledge to help them find permanent housing.

Both initiatives, if they were to succeed, would make New York even more of an attractive destination for illegal crossers, thus exacerbating the problems Adams and Hochul say they want to solve. Times like this add to the overwhelming evidence we are being ruled by amateurs, and create serious doubts that New York can be saved. To be clear, the city will outlast Adams and Hochul because most people have nowhere else to go or can\u2019t afford to leave. But the pols\u2019 record so far shows that decline, decline and more decline will be their damning legacy. The next time you hear someone spout nonsense, be patient. Chances are they get their misinformation from The New York Times. Consider two recent front-page headlines. First, \u201cG.O.P. Blueprint for \u201925: Gutting Climate Progress.\u201d See, all Republicans want dirty air and water. Then this: \u201cAppeals Court Rules White House Overstepped 1st Amendment on Social Media.\u201d Saying \u201cOverstepped\u201d is a too-nice way to say the White House violated the First Amendment by pushing social media outlets to restrict free speech by COVID dissenters. Fair and balanced? Fuhgeddaboutit! Reader Joe Alloy smells a rat, or two. He writes: \u201cThe new wife of NJ Sen. Bob Menendez cashes in $400,000 worth of gold bars just three years after she faced foreclosure. Silly Menendez, who makes $174,00 a year, apparently didn\u2019t discuss how to launder the money with the Biden family.\u201d \u201cBut have no fears, fellow Americans. The FBI is on the case.\u201d",

        "content": "Joe\u2019s 9/11 snub Recently, the White House explained that the president will travel to Alaska to mark the somber occasion of 9/11 after his Sept. 10 trip to Hanoi, Vietnam, where he will meet with Vietnamese leaders ( \u201cGive us a \u2018break,\u2019 \u201d Sept. 4). It will be the first time that a president has not attended any of the observances that have been held annually in New York City, Pennsylvania, Virginia or at the White House. 9/11 was one of the worst events in our country\u2019s history. The decision to forgo the traditional observance at the attack sites or the White House raises concerns about the administration\u2019s priorities. It\u2019s vital to prioritize commemorating the heroes and victims of 9/11 above all else on this day of remembrance. Many Americans find it disheartening that the focus appears to have shifted away from honoring the memory of those who perished, and that the awareness of 9/11 is receding. It was a terrorist attack against our country, and everybody should remember it, take every precaution, watch out vigilantly and hope it never happens again. Lou Walker Cape Coral, Fla.

Beautiful East River Park is being destroyed with a thousand 75-year-old trees already savagely cut down under a City Council decree in the name of flood mitigation. There was a plan approved after many public hearings to build an eight-foot wall between the park and FDR Drive. Several months later, a new plan (costing three times the price of the original one) was quickly put into action calling for cementing over all the grassy and flower-filled areas, as well as cutting down all the trees. There was a huge neighborhood outcry while the city denied there was any \u201coriginal\u201d plan. The residents had to activate a Freedom of Information Law request to prove that there was indeed an original plan. Too late, unfortunately. So much for the Million Trees NYC program. It will take more than 75 years to fully replace our park and those magnificent trees.

        "description": "While the risk of wildfires causing devastation to communities and the environment is well known, new research is showing that the smoke from massive vegetation fires may also have serious effects on the brain.",
        "content": "( ) \u2014 While the risk of wildfires causing devastation to communities and the environment is well known, new research is showing that the smoke from massive vegetation fires may also have serious effects on the brain. A study from the University of Michigan published last month found that wildfires, as well as emissions from farming, may pose especially toxic threats to a person\u2019s cognitive health, even increasing their risk of developing dementia. The study from found a \u201cstrong likelihood\u201d that agriculture and wildfires may be doing more damage than previously thought and will need to be closely monitored and studied for their risks to public health. \u201cWe saw in our research that all airborne particles increased the risk of dementia but those generated by agricultural settings and wildfires seemed to be especially toxic for the brain,\u201d said Sara Adar, associate chair of the Department of Epidemiology in the School of Public Health. Adar is leading multiple studies on the impacts of exposures on cognitive aging and dementia. Boya Zhang, a research fellow who studies the effects of air pollution on the body, said this recent study suggests that \u201cparticulate matter air pollution from agriculture and wildfires might be more neurotoxic compared with other sources.\u201d Zhang stressed that more research would be needed to confirm that hypothesis. The research focused on 30,000 Americans who were involved in a previous study that looked into the development of dementia over an 18-year period. Data was provided by the Health and Retirement Study, with participants regularly interviewed to provide feedback about their overall health and cognition. Michigan researchers then took that data, focusing on where the participants lived, cross-referenced it with exposure to particulate matter air pollution, and found that those who were exposed more regularly had a greater risk of dementia. The findings could not be explained by other factors, researchers added. \u201cThese findings are quite timely given the increasing frequency of wildfire smoke in our communities,\u201d Adar said. \u201cOur data suggest that in addition to some of the more obvious health impacts of wildfire smoke like irritation to our throats and eyes along with breathing difficulties, high smoke days might also be taking a toll on our brains.\u201d Unusually poor air quality across the country has regularly triggered public health alerts warning of microscopic toxins in air pollution. Some fine particulate matter is so small it can enter the brain through the nose directly or cross the brain\u2019s protective blood-brain barrier. Some particulate matter is also known to affect the lungs and heart, in addition to the brain. This year saw a record number of air quality alerts in the U.S., propelled by massive wildfires in Canada. In California alone, there have been more than this year with more than a quarter-million acres burned in what is widely considered a \u201cmild\u201d fire season. Adar said wildfire smoke is becoming a \u201cmore widespread stressor,\u201d with many cities experiencing as many as 30 days or more of smoke impacts. Wildfires are believed to contribute up to 25% of the fine particulate matter exposures across the entire country and as much as 50% in Western states. Any new health effects linked to wildfires are extra concerning to researchers as global climate change increases the risk of ecological disasters happening with more regularity. \u201cWhile individual wildfires may be short-lived, these events are becoming more frequent in our communities due to warmer temperatures, drier conditions, and longer fire seasons. As we\u2019ve seen, wildfire smoke can also travel very far distances,\u201d Adar said. The purpose of the study was mainly to provide evidence to policymakers about the risks of exposure to these emission sources. Dementia, which is the seventh-leading cause of death in the world and one of the major causes of disability for older people, could take years to develop, so any evidence of a possible increased risk factor is critical in understanding and possibly preventing it. \u201cWith the knowledge of which sources are more toxic than others, it may be possible to design interventions for specific sources as a more effective way to decrease the burden of dementia,\u201d Zhang said. A similar study published by the found that wildfire smoke could cause inflammation of the brain that can persist for months or longer. That inflammation can be found in the hippocampus, the region of the brain responsible for learning and memory. In addition to the increased risk of dementia, wildfire could also be , researchers theorized.",

        "content": "CLEVELAND \u2014 He still remembers the first gunshot. For an instant, standing on the running board of the motorcade car, he entertained the vain hope that maybe it was just a firecracker or a blown tire. But he knew guns, and he knew better. Then came another shot. And another. And the president slumped down. For so many nights afterward, he relived that grisly moment in his dreams. Now, 60 years later, Paul Landis, one of the Secret Service agents just feet away from President John F. Kennedy on that fateful day in Dallas, is telling his story in full for the first time. And in at least one key respect, his account differs from the official version in a way that may change the understanding of what happened in Dealey Plaza. Landis has spent most of the intervening years fleeing history, trying to forget that unforgettable moment etched in the consciousness of a grieving nation. The memory of the explosion of violence and the desperate race to the hospital and the devastating flight home and the wrenching funeral with John F. Kennedy Jr. saluting his fallen father \u2014 it was all too much, too torturous, so much so that Landis left the service and Washington behind. Until finally, after the nightmares had passed at last, he could think about it again. And he could read about it. And he realized that what he read was not quite right, not as he remembered it. As it turns out, if his recollections are correct, the much-discussed \"magic bullet\" may not have been so magic after all. His memory challenges the theory advanced by the Warren Commission that has been the subject of so much speculation and debate over the years \u2014 that one of the bullets fired at the president's limousine hit not only Kennedy but Gov. John Connally Jr. of Texas, who was riding with him, in multiple places. Landis' account, included in a forthcoming memoir, would rewrite the narrative of one of modern American history's most earth-shattering days in an important way. It may not mean any more than that. But it could also encourage those who have long suspected that there was more than one gunman in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, adding new grist to one of the nation's enduring mysteries. As with all things related to the assassination, of course, his account raises questions of its own. Landis remained silent for 60 years, which has fueled doubts even for his former Secret Service partner, and memories are tricky even for those sincerely certain of their recollections. A couple elements of his account contradict the official statements he filed with authorities immediately after the shooting, and some of the implications of his version cannot be easily reconciled to the existing record. But he was there, a firsthand witness, and it is rare for new testimony to emerge six decades after the fact. He has never subscribed to the conspiracy theories and stresses that he is not promoting one now. At age 88, he said, all he wants is to tell what he saw and what he did. He will leave it to everyone else to draw conclusions. \"There's no goal at this point,\" he said in an interview last month in Cleveland, the first time he has talked about this with a reporter in advance of his book, \"The Final Witness,\" which will be published by Chicago Review Press on Oct. 10. \"I just think it had been long enough that I needed to tell my story.\" What it comes down to is a copper-jacketed 6.5 mm projectile. The Warren Commission decided that one of the bullets fired that day struck the president from behind, exited from the front of his throat and continued on to hit Connally, somehow managing to injure his back, chest, wrist and thigh. It seemed incredible that a single bullet could do all that, so skeptics called it the magic bullet theory. Investigators came to that conclusion partly because the bullet was found on a stretcher believed to have held Connally at Parkland Memorial Hospital, so they assumed it had exited his body during efforts to save his life. But Landis, who was never interviewed by the Warren Commission, said that is not what happened. In fact, he said, he was the one who found the bullet \u2014 and he found it not in the hospital near Connally but in the presidential limousine lodged in the back of the seat behind where Kennedy was sitting. When he spotted the bullet after the motorcade arrived at the hospital, he said he grabbed it to thwart souvenir hunters. Then, for reasons that still seem fuzzy even to him, he said he entered the hospital and placed it next to Kennedy on the president's stretcher, assuming it could somehow help doctors figure out what happened. At some point, he now guesses, the stretchers must have been pushed together, and the bullet was shaken from one to another. \"There was nobody there to secure the scene, and that was a big, big bother to me,\" Landis said. \"All the agents that were there were focused on the president.\" A crowd was gathering. \"This was all going on so quickly. And I was just afraid that \u2014 it was a piece of evidence, that I realized right away. Very important. And I didn't want it to disappear or get lost. So it was, 'Paul, you've got to make a decision,' and I grabbed it.'\" Landis theorizes that the bullet struck Kennedy in the back but for some reason was undercharged and did not penetrate deeply, therefore popping back out before the president's body was removed from the limousine. Landis has been reluctant to speculate on the larger implications. He always believed that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman. But now? \"At this point, I'm beginning to doubt myself,\" he said. \"Now I begin to wonder.\" That is as far as he is willing to go. A native of Ohio and son of a college sports coach, Landis does not come across as a swaggering security agent. He had to stretch to meet the 5-foot-8 height requirement when he joined the service and could no longer do so. \"I'm too little now,\" he said, to make it in today's agency. He is quiet and unassuming, dressed in a coat and tie for an interview, his gray hair neatly trimmed. He has a little trouble hearing and speaks softly, but his mind is clear and his recollections steady. In recent years, he confided his story with several key figures, including Lewis Merletti, a former director of the Secret Service. James Robenalt, a Cleveland lawyer and author of several books of history, has deeply researched the assassination and helped Landis process his memories. \"If what he says is true, which I tend to believe, it is likely to reopen the question of a second shooter, if not even more,\" Robenalt said. \"If the bullet we know as the magic or pristine bullet stopped in President Kennedy's back, it means that the central thesis of the Warren Report, the single-bullet theory, is wrong.\" And if Connally was hit by a separate bullet, he added, then it seemed possible it was not from Oswald, who he argued could not have reloaded that fast. Merletti, who has been friendly with Landis for a decade, was not sure what to think about his account. \"I don't know if that story's true or not, but I do know that the agents that were there that day, they were tormented for years by what happened,\" he said in an interview. Merletti referred Landis to Ken Gormley, the president of Duquesne University and a prominent presidential historian, who helped him find an agent for his book. In an interview, Gormley said he was not surprised that a traumatized agent would come forward all these years later, comparing it to a dying declaration in legal cases. \"It's very common as people get to the end of their lives,\" Gormley said. \"They want to make peace with things. They want to get on the table things they've been holding back, especially if it's a piece of history and they want the record corrected. This does not look like a play by someone trying to get attention for himself or money. I don't read it that way at all. I think he firmly believes this. Whether it fits together, I don't know. But people can eventually figure that out.\" Landis' account varies in a couple of respects from two written statements he filed in the week after the shooting. Aside from not mentioning finding the bullet, he reported hearing only two shots. \"I do not recall hearing a third shot,\" he wrote. Likewise, he did not mention going into the trauma room where Kennedy was taken, writing that he \"remained outside by the door\" when the first lady went in. Gerald Posner, author of \"Case Closed,\" a 1993 book that concluded that Oswald indeed killed Kennedy on his own, said he was dubious. While he did not question Landis' sincerity, Posner said the story did not add up. \"People's memories generally do not improve over time, and it is a flashing warning sign to me, about skepticism I have over his story, that on some very important details of the assassination, including the number of shots, his memory has gotten better instead of worse,\" he said. \"Even assuming that he is accurately describing what happened with the bullet,\" Posner added, \"it might mean nothing more than we now know that the bullet that came out of Gov. Connally did so in the limousine, not on a stretcher in Parkland where it was found.\" Landis said the reports he filed after the assassination included mistakes; he was in shock and had barely slept for five days, as he focused on helping the first lady through the ordeal, he said, and not paying enough attention to what he submitted. He did not think to mention the bullet, he said. It was not until 2014 that he realized that the official account of the bullet differed from his memory, he said, but he did not come forward then out of a feeling that he had made a mistake in putting it on the stretcher without telling anyone in that pre-\"CSI,\" secure-the-crime-scene era. \"I didn't want to talk about it,\" Landis said. \"I was afraid. I started to think, did I do something wrong? There was a fear that I might have done something wrong and I shouldn't talk about it.\" Indeed, his partner, Clint Hill, the legendary Secret Service agent who clambered onto the back of the speeding limousine i n a futile effort to save Kennedy, discouraged Landis from speaking out. \"Many ramifications,\" Hill warned in a 2014 email that Landis saved and shared last month. Hill, who has set out his own account of what happened in multiple books and interviews, cast doubt on Landis' version Friday. \"I believe it raises concerns when the story he is telling now, 60 years after the fact, is different than the statements he wrote in the days following the tragedy\" and told in subsequent years, Hill said in an email. \"In my mind, there are serious inconsistencies in his various statements/stories.\" Landis' rendezvous with history began in the small town of Worthington, Ohio, north of Columbus. After college and a stint in the Ohio Air National Guard, he was working in a clothing store when a family friend described his job in the Secret Service. Intrigued, Landis joined in 1959 in the Cincinnati office, where he chased thieves who swiped Social Security checks out of mailboxes. A year later, he was sent to Washington, where he joined the protective detail for President Dwight Eisenhower's grandchildren. After Kennedy was elected, Landis, code named Debut because of his youth, was assigned to guard the new president's children and later the first lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, alongside Hill. Because the first lady accompanied her husband to Dallas that fall day in 1963, Landis, then 28, was part of the motorcade, riding the rear of the right running board on the black Cadillac convertible, code named Halfback, just feet behind the presidential limousine. At the first shot, Landis turned to look over his right shoulder in the direction of the sound but spotted nothing. Then he turned to the limousine and saw Kennedy raising his arms, evidently hit. Suddenly, Landis noticed that Hill had leapt off their follow-up car and was sprinting toward the limousine. Landis thought about doing the same but did not have an angle. He said he heard a second shot that sounded louder and finally the fatal third shot that hit Kennedy in the head. Landis had to duck to avoid being splattered by flesh and brain matter. He knew instantly that the president was dead. Hill, now on the back of the limousine, turned back and confirmed it with a thumbs-down.Once they reached the hospital, Hill and Landis coaxed the distraught first lady to let go of her husband so he could be taken inside. After they exited the car, Landis noticed two bullet fragments in a pool of bright red blood. He fingered one of them but put it back. That's when he said he noticed the intact bullet in the seam of the tufted dark leather cushioning. He said he slipped it into his coat pocket and headed into the hospital, where he planned to give it to a supervisor but in the confusion instinctively put it on Kennedy's stretcher instead. The hospital's senior engineer later found it when he was moving Connally's stretcher, by then empty, and bumped it against another stretcher in the hall, resulting in the bullet falling out. The Warren Commission report said that it \"eliminated President Kennedy's stretcher as a source of the bullet\" because the president remained on his stretcher while doctors tried to save his life and was not removed until his body was placed in a coffin. Investigators determined that the bullet, designated Commission Exhibit 399, was fired by the same C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found in the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. They concluded that the bullet passed through Kennedy, then entered Connally's right shoulder, struck his rib, exited under his right nipple and continued through his right wrist and into his left thigh. Doctors concurred that the single bullet could have caused all the damage. But the bullet was described as nearly pristine and had lost only one or two grains of its original 160 or 161 grains in weight, causing skeptics to doubt that it could have done all that the commission said it had. Still, ballistic experts using modern forensic techniques concluded at the 50th anniversary of the assassination that the single-bullet theory was perfectly plausible. Landis said he was surprised that the Warren Commission never interviewed him but assumed that his supervisors were protecting the agents, who had been out late the night before socializing (Landis until 5 a.m., although he insisted they were not drunk). \"Nobody really asked me,\" he said. Night after night, those seconds of violence in Dallas kept replaying in his head, his own personal Zapruder film on an endless loop. \"The president's head exploding \u2014 I could not shake that vision,\" he said. \"Whatever I was doing, that's all I was thinking about.\" Many pictures of those days of mourning show Landis at Jacqueline Kennedy's side as she endured the rituals of a presidential farewell. With Landis and Hill still protecting her, the former first lady was in constant motion in the months afterward. \"She'd be in the back seat sobbing, and you'd want to say something, but it wasn't really our place to say anything,\" Landis recalled. After six months, he could not take it anymore and left the Secret Service. Haunted, he moved to Cape Cod in Massachusetts, then New York, then Ohio near Cleveland. For decades, he made a living in real estate and machine products and house painting, anything as long as it had nothing to do with protecting presidents. He was generally aware of the conspiracy theories, yet never read a book about them \u2014 or the Warren Commission report, for that matter. \"I just paid no attention to that,\" he said. \"I just removed myself. I just felt I had been there. I had seen it, and I knew what I saw and what I did. And that's all.\" He did a few interviews in 2010 and thereafter but never mentioned finding the bullet. Then, in 2014, a local police chief he knew gave him a copy of \"Six Seconds in Dallas,\" a 1967 book by Josiah Thompson arguing that there were multiple shooters. Landis read it and believed the official account of the bullet was wrong. That led to conversations with Merletti and Gormley and eventually, after many years, to his book. It was not easy. As he finished the manuscript, he stared at the computer screen, broke down and cried uncontrollably. \"I didn't realize that I had so many suppressed emotions and feelings,\" he said. \"I just couldn't stop. And that was just a huge emotional relief.\" This article originally appeared in The New York Times.",

        "content": "It looked like a MAGA match-up for the ages: two of the most Trump-aligned Republicans anywhere in the country\u2014 Kari Lake and Blake Masters \u2014squaring off against each other for a shot at the U.S. Senate seat held by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ). Lake, the Trump-obsessed failed gubernatorial candidate who continues to deny the 2020 election and her own 2022 defeat, is all but certain to launch a Senate campaign this fall. Masters, a hard-right Peter Thiel acolyte who lost his 2022 Senate bid after running a dark and dystopian campaign, is gearing up to launch his bid for the GOP nomination, according to a Wall Street Journal story last week. Running on the GOP ticket last year, the two campaigned across the state together, with one Arizona strategist saying they \u201cgenuinely like[d] each other\u201d and \u201cdrew very close\u201d on the campaign trail. But the 37-year old Masters was known to be itching for another shot at the Senate, and the Journal\u2019s report\u2014which included the detail he had already taped his campaign video\u2014suggested he\u2019d be willing to take on his old friend in order to get there. Suddenly, however, sources close to Masters are doubting whether he will go through with a campaign that would entail a brutal cage match of a primary fight against his former ally. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s running,\u201d a Republican operative who\u2019s spoken with Masters about the matter told The Daily Beast. \u201cI always thought this was a trial balloon.\u201d \u201cQuite frankly, he\u2019s never publicly acknowledged that he wants to get into the race,\u201d the operative added. \u201cThere is not one comment.\u201d Another source close to the 2022 Senate candidate agreed that Masters might be reconsidering a campaign, while a third GOP source said it would be surprising if he went through with it. Arizona Republican operative Barrett Marson told The Daily Beast he isn\u2019t convinced that Masters will run for the seat. \u201cI\u2019m not buying it yet,\u201d Mason said. On Saturday, The New York Times reported that Masters and Trump had a \u201cblunt\u201d phone call last Sunday when the former president laced into Masters over not promoting claims of election fraud. \u201cLook at Kari\u2014Kari\u2019s winning with very little money,\u201d Trump said to Masters, according to The Times. \u201cAnd if they say, \u2018How is your family?\u2019 She says, \u2018The election was rigged and stolen.\u2019 You\u2019ll lose if you go soft. You\u2019re going to lose that base.\u201d The report also claimed Masters has been questioning behind the scenes whether or not Lake will actually run for the seat. A source close to Lake fired back on that point. \"Blake Masters was outspent by $70 million dollars and completely reliant on a single Big Tech benefactor,\u201d Lake\u2019s senior adviser, Caroline Wren, told The Daily Beast, taking a swipe at Thiel. \u201cIf he believes that the party needs someone with a proven ability to fund-raise, then he's not the guy.\u201d Masters didn\u2019t return multiple Daily Beast requests for comment on this story inquiring about his plans. Adding to the confusion, some Republican insiders told The Daily Beast they do believe that Masters will ultimately run. But the consensus within Arizona GOP circles was that Masters is a lot further from jumping in than it may have seemed. Why exactly Masters might reconsider a run is unclear. Within Trump\u2019s orbit, there is a sense that it would be highly difficult for him to defeat Lake in a primary\u2014and that it would be difficult for him to win the former president\u2019s endorsement over her. Notably, Trump endorsed both Lake and Masters in their respective primaries last year, adding complexity to the dynamics if they were to both enter the race. Beyond that, it\u2019s not inevitable that Masters\u2019 biggest benefactor, Thiel, would help him in 2024 as much as he did in 2022, when he spent $17 million to support his campaign. His five-point defeat to Sen. Mark Kelly (D) was one of the GOP\u2019s biggest disappointments of last year\u2019s midterm election, and his campaign attracted national attention for its gloomy tone and the candidate\u2019s own far-right beliefs . Whatever decision Masters makes, it will significantly shape one of the marquee Senate contests of 2024, which could easily sway party control of the chamber next year. In Arizona, the GOP could benefit from an unusual general election environment, in which the centrist Sinema runs as an independent and Rep. Ruben Gallego as the Democratic nominee. (Sinema has not yet announced her plans.) A nasty and expensive primary between Lake and Masters, however, could harm the GOP\u2019s chances. But some Republicans worry that Lake is so toxic in a general election that handing her the nomination would ensure the race is over before it begins. \u201cShe\u2019s a guaranteed L,\u201d said Chuck Coughlin, a longtime GOP strategist and pollster in the state. \u201cShe can\u2019t win a general election.\u201d Despite Masters\u2019 drawbacks as a candidate, observers like Coughlin see him as someone who could at least keep the race competitive for Republicans\u2014if he rebrands himself. \u201cThis is not going to be easy, but is there a lane there that permits him to frame his candidacy around someone who can win the seat,\u201d Coughlin said. \u201cHe ran against a much better candidate than she did. He was much more competitive with Kelly than she could be with a Gallego or a Sinema.\u201d Lake\u2019s supposed allies in Trumpworld may know it too\u2014despite the chatter that the former president would back her again or even consider her as his 2024 vice presidential candidate. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see Blake beating her in a primary,\u201d a Trump adviser said. \u201cSo the hope is that Kari finally gets serious about running a real campaign with competent help, rather than the goofballs and drama queens she\u2019s had around her before.\u201d \u201cEveryone loves Blake. He\u2019s brilliant and is a true believer in the MAGA issues,\u201d this Trump adviser added. \u201cBut it\u2019s impossible to deny Kari is a charismatic talent and also got closer to winning than Blake did last time.\u201d Likewise, an operative close to the Trump campaign wondered what Trump would get out of endorsing Lake or Masters early in the primary. \u201cWhat does he gain out of endorsing in the race?\u201d this source said. But some in Trump\u2019s orbit are wary enough of Lake that they\u2019ve quietly tried to recruit her 2022 GOP primary rival, Karrin Taylor Robson , into the Senate race. Robson has publicly said she will not run, but one Trump-aligned operative recently reached out to her to urge her to reconsider, according to a source familiar with the call. The source added Robson remains committed to not running for the seat. A Trump-friendly GOP stalwart, Robson is seen as a candidate who could unite party factions and compete in a general election\u2014in part thanks to her family\u2019s immense wealth. Robson narrowly lost to Lake in the 2022 governor primary after spending $15 million of her family\u2019s fortune in the race. Neither a Lake spokesperson nor a Trump spokesperson returned The Daily Beast\u2019s requests for comment on this story. According to two sources familiar with the matter, Trump hasn\u2019t decided who he might support in a Lake-Masters showdown. Lake, of course, has not even entered the race yet, with one source aware of her plans saying she is targeting an October campaign launch date. With the race potentially evolving into a nasty MAGAworld battle, some Trumpworld operatives have sought to avoid the race altogether. As for Lake\u2019s team, they\u2019ve already begun attacking Masters. At the end of August, a Lake campaign \u201cWarRoom\u201d Twitter account ripped into Masters for joining a Twitter Spaces conversation with Arizona state House candidate Andrew Jackson. Jackson, a pastor who is known for interviewing Arizona political notables, was a supporter of Lake\u2019s but has since taken issue with her approach to alleged election irregularities. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have you back, Blake!\u201d the account wrote . \u201cWe hope your next interview is with someone who has not spent the last 9 months smearing Kari.\u201d Lake herself tagged Masters for a follow-up tweet, saying : \u201cI hope you bring up election fraud, and Election crime. You\u2019ve been quite silent. And \u2018Dr\u2019 Andrew doesn\u2019t think it exists.\u201d (For good measure, Lake added three cricket emojis to her tweet.) \u201cShe has never talked to me personally,\u201d Jackson responded when reached for comment on Lake\u2019s team taking aim at him. \u201cI\u2019m for election integrity.\u201d Jackson also took issue with Lake\u2019s blanket allegation of \u201celection crime\u201d in the 2020 election. \u201cPersonal names are being used and said they\u2019re criminals,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just saying, constitutionally, I could never call somebody a criminal unless it\u2019s proven in a court of law.\u201d Zachary Petrizzo Politics Reporter @ZTPetrizzo zachary.petrizzo@thedailybeast.com Sam Brodey Deputy Politics Editor @sambrodey Sam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com Got a tip?

There, students are giving presentations on their work to their classmates. \"We are looking for audience members that are paying close attention and forming higher-order questions,\" a teacher tells her students. The presenter, first-year Genesis Benavides, asks her fellow students: \"How do social and cultural expectations influence our own personality? Personal identity?\" Feedback from peers is part of how students work is evaluated. A student raises his hand to ask Genesis about her work. \"When you were writing your poems, did you feel like you related to it?\" he asks. \"Yes, I related to the main character, \"she answers. Students take tests and write papers at Bell, which is part of Columbia Heights Educational Campus . But presentations are another way Bell students show what they've learned. \"If a kid shows up and says something out loud, that's value. If a student talks with another student about the objective of the day, that's value,\" says Robert Athmer, special education instructor at Bell. This interaction is part of a new wave of assessment and grading policies that many U.S. schools are adopting. Recently, the Los Angeles and San Diego school districts, with nearly 700,000 students between them, removed behavior from the factors teachers use to calculate grades. And the Philadelphia and Fairfax County, Virginia, school districts are among many that have adopted no-zero policies that set 50% as the lowest score a student can get, even for a missed assignment. \"It shouldn't matter when students turn in an assignment. If they've got the knowledge, they've got the knowledge,\" said Kevin Hickerson, president-elect of the Fairfax Education Association, in 2016. Hundreds of high schools have adopted an approach called mastery. The idea is that students are given repeated opportunities to learn information until they show they've learned it. \"We put kids in classes, and we all have them learn math. And after a week or two, we move on to the next unit, and we move on, regardless of whether every student in the class has mastered the content,\" says Mike Flanagan, CEO of the Mastery Transcript Consortium. Mastery learning, he says, is aimed at requiring students \"to actually really nail the content before they move on.\" SEE MORE: Should all schools adopt a 4-day week? Traditionally, the time between tests in school, known as seat time, is fixed, and then the class learns new material. So some students learn more than others. The mastery approach aims to make all students learn the same amount, with the amount of time needed varying between students. \"The swim test isn't a swim race,\" says Flanagan. \"We're not sort of having all kids jump into the lake and see who gets across the pond first. We want to enable all kids how to teach them how to swim.\" \"Whether it's literacy, whether it's math, whether it's the fundamentals of science, you shouldn't be allowed to graduate if you've only got a C-minus or like a 70% understanding of the material,\" says Flanagan. \"If they need anything specific before going to the next step, we stay in that step until they achieve them, until they master all the standards. They can't go to the next step if they don't know 100% [of] every step.\" The move away from traditional assessments appeals to Genesis Benavides at Bell. \"I really like the way grades are handled in the school because it's not only about completing an assessment or taking a test.\" Report cards at Bell include numerical and letter grades. But dozens of U.S. high schools have adopted a new kind of transcript that describes student work, skills, and accomplishments without numerical or letter-based grades. Harvard, MIT, and Cal Tech are among the three hundred and seventeen universities that have accepted these transcripts for college applications. While each school has its own policy. The Mastery Transcript Consortium is piloting what they call a learning record, a document that skips listing courses and credits but shows progress toward mastery of skills. All fifty states now allow schools in some way to use mastery instead of grades to graduate. But alternative grading policies have drawn controversy nationwide, including in St. Lucie County, Florida, in 2018, when the district changed grading policy to make the lowest possible grade 50%. In 2017, Diane Tirado was fired during her probationary period. The district said it was because of poor performance. Tirado instead says it was her refusal to give a fifty instead of a zero for work that wasn't handed in. Well, what if they don't turn anything in? We give them a fifty. I go; no, we don't,\" she said. \"We have a nation of kids that are expecting to get paid and live their lives just for showing up, and it's not real.\" Some parents agree with the sentiment. \"You don't know what's going on at home, and it's what you see is front-level, cause if my son blatantly chooses not to do it, he knows he's got an issue,\" said one St. Lucie father. It's a debate that's only going to intensify for students, teachers, and parents as the new school year unfolds. Trending stories at Scrippsnews.com",

While global food prices eased in August, those of rice rose 9.8 percent compared to the previous month, \"reflecting trade disruptions in the aftermath of a ban on Indica white rice exports by India\", the FAO said in a monthly report. \"Uncertainty about the ban's duration and concerns over export restrictions caused supply-chain actors to hold on to stocks, re-negotiate contracts or stop making price offers, thereby limiting most trade to small volumes and previously concluded sales,\" the UN agency said. Rice is a major world food staple and prices on international markets have soared in the wake of the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the impact of the El Nino weather phenomenon on production levels. India announced in July a ban on exports of non-basmati white rice, which account for around a quarter of its total. The consumer affairs and food ministry said at the time that the move would \"ensure adequate availability\" and \"allay the rise in prices in the domestic market\". India accounts for more than 40 percent of all global rice shipments. The ban was expected to hit African nations, Turkey, Syria and Pakistan, all of which were already struggling with high inflation, data analytics firm Gro Intelligence warned in a note in July. The Philippines, one of the world's top importers of rice, reached a five-year agreement with Vietnam on Thursday to buy rice. World rice stocks are forecast to reach an all-time high of 198.1 million tonnes, with India and China holding nearly three quarter of this volume like in previous seasons, according to the FAO. This total represents around 38 percent of rice consumption forecast over the same period. But aggregate rice reserves held by the rest of the world are expected to end the year with a second successive contraction, it added. El Nino could also have a negative effect on the next harvests. The turmoil in the rice market comes as global food prices have been progressively easing from a peak last year after war broke out between major grain producers Russia and Ukraine. The FAO's global food price index, which tracks monthly changes in international prices of a basket of food commodities, averaged 121.4 points in August, down 2.1 percent from July. The index was 24 percent below the summit it reached in March 2022. Prices of cereal, meat, dairy and vegetable oils all fell in August. Sugar prices, however, rose by 1.3 percent due to \"heightened concerns over the impact of the El Nino phenomenon on sugarcane crops, along with below-average rains in August and persistent dry weather conditions in Thailand\". Global food prices had slightly rebounded in July when Russia pulled out of a deal brokered by the UN and Turkey that had enabled Ukraine to ship grains via the Black Sea. The FAO said on Friday it had lowered its forecast for world trade in cereals in 2023 and 2024 to 466 million tonnes -- a 1.7 percent drop from the previous marketing season. \"Traded volumes of wheat and maize are all predicted to decline, due to a mix of reasons, including falling exports by Ukraine due to trade disruptions associated with the ongoing war,\" it said. \"FAO has also lowered its forecast for world trade in rice from the July figure considering the stepped-up export restrictions by India,\" the FAO added. An expected recovery of the rice trade in 2024 would be \"modest\" if the India restrictions are protracted and El Nino disrupts production in other Asian exporters, the FAO added. \u00a9 Copyright AFP 2023.

        "description": "Niger, a key exporter of dry onions in West Africa, is responsible for 70 percent of onion imports by Ghana.",
        "content": "\u2013 On most Saturday mornings, the shed of Yakubu Akteniba, an onion seller at Adjen Kotoku market, a 33km drive from Accra, is swamped by customers haggling over fresh produce. But since early August, things have quietened as business has taken a nosedive due to disruption in the food supply chain across West Africa. \u201cWe used to receive at least 20 truckloads of onions daily here,\u201d Akteniba, who speaks for the market\u2019s 200-member onion sellers\u2019 association, told Al Jazeera. \u201cThe number of trucks coming here has now dropped to between two and five daily \u2026 If things don\u2019t change, most of us will be out of business,\u201d he said. The source of the crisis is Niger, four countries away from Ghana, but also a member of the 15-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). On July 26, members of the Nigerien presidential guard overthrew Mohamed Bazoum, the country\u2019s democratically elected leader since 2021. In response, ECOWAS imposed a number of sanctions including the closure of borders surrounding Niger \u2013 and cut off trade with it. That decision has stoked a brewing food crisis across West Africa. Niger is the key exporter of dry onions in the region, responsible for almost two-thirds of total exports in 2021, according to market intelligence platform, Indexbox. Figures from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC) show that in 2021, Niger exported onions worth $23.4m, making it the world\u2019s 31st largest exporter of onions. In the same year, onions were the sixth-most exported product for Niger. The main destinations of onion exports from Niger were Ghana ($21.7m), Ivory Coast ($1.15m), Benin ($451,000), Togo ($84,500) and Nigeria ($35,100). All five countries have backed ECOWAS sanctions in Niger. But the sanctions have triggered a shortage of onions and other food commodities like beans and millet \u2013 and driven up the cost in places where supply is still available. \u201cThey [ECOWAS] have blocked the vehicles from coming,\u201d Akteniba told Al Jazeera. According to Akteniba, before the military takeover, a 100kg sack of onions was selling at $61 but the price has now almost doubled to $105. A 25kg sack of onions now costs $27 compared with $17 before the borders were closed. The bulb-shaped vegetable is revered in West Africa, where many, including Ghanaians, use it as a staple in their cuisines. Onions are boiled, fried, caramelised or even served raw to garnish many meals. But the cost of onions has become exorbitant as the country\u2019s economic troubles stew; about a quarter of Ghana\u2019s 32 million people live on less than $1 a day, according to the Ghana Statistical Service. \u201cI love onions but for some time now I am cutting down on the quantity in preparing meals because it is becoming too expensive,\u201d Deborah Biney, a 40-year-old mother of two, told Al Jazeera. \u201cBefore the political situation in Niger, I was buying three big pieces of onions for $0.17 in my neighbourhood, but now I use the same amount to buy just a piece.\u201d Onions also have several health benefits, including improved blood sugar regulation and increasing bone density, experts say. Patience Naa Adjeley Adjei, a nutritionist and a home economics teacher, told Al Jazeera that the nutritional value of onions could not be underestimated, saying it would be \u201cdisturbing\u201d if households stopped using the vegetables due to the soaring prices. \u201cOnions have a distinct flavour that adds to dishes and stimulate appetite \u2026 they are low in calories and fat but rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants,\u201d Adjei stated. \u201cThey contain fibre, vitamin C and various beneficial compounds that may have health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties.\u201d Nigeria accounts for 20 percent of the onions sold in Ghana, while Burkina Faso exports about 5 percent of the onions consumed there. Ghana only produces 5 percent of the onions it consumes locally. But 70 percent of onions, valued at about $2m weekly, have been imported from Niger, according to Food and Agriculture Minister Bryan Acheampong. \u201cI deem this an embarrassment and a needless drain on our scarce foreign exchange,\u201d he said recently, at the launch of a government programme to boost Ghanaian food sufficiency. He added that Nana Akufo-Addo\u2019s administration is finalising an \u201caggressive five-year plan\u201d to build food security and resilience by ensuring year-round production to halt the importation of essential commodities like tomatoes and onions. Niger\u2019s military government has refused to release Bazoum and has served notice it wants to remain in power for at least three years before transitioning back to civilian leadership, even in the face of a possible military intervention by ECOWAS. Experts have warned that if the impasse persists, it could result in dire humanitarian consequences and a food security crisis in the region. A study undertaken by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) this April showed that acute food insecurity is on track to reach a 10-year high in West and Central Africa this year as humanitarian assistance is severely hindered by insecurity in conflict-affected areas of Burkina Faso and Mali. The spread of activities by armed groups in the Sahel is also hindering the food supply chain in the region, the onion sellers\u2019 association said. \u201cOne major issue is attacks on our trucks by terrorists, especially in the Niger area. The coup itself is not affecting the supply of onions and other foods like beans and millet that much, but the state of insecurity,\u201d Peter Appiah Mensah, who owns trucks that cart onions, beans and millets from Niger to Ghana, said. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Ziad Hamoui, co-chair of the Food Trade Coalition for Africa, said the economic sanctions by the regional bloc on the uranium-rich country, especially the border closure come at a cost. He called on regional leaders to soften their stance. \u201cI think it\u2019s still important to maintain the regional trade flows,\u201d said Hamoui, who doubles as president of the Ghanaian chapter of Borderless Alliance, a regional trade advocacy group. \u201cFirst of all, you can\u2019t really stop trade by blocking the borders. So, closing the borders on one hand, does not solve the issue. \u201cOn the other hand, there need to be policies where countries can be held accountable \u2026 we need to have mechanisms in place that allow countries to talk together in cases of complaints and challenges,\u201d he added. Some of the onion trucks are also stuck behind borders in Burkina Faso, also military ruled and which has allied itself with Mali, to support Niger. In Ghana, vegetable traders are worried that the vegetables might rot and their value depreciate by the time the borders are reopened. \u201cMaybe, this is a wake-up call for our government to invest more in growing our own onions here in Ghana,\u201d Akteniba told Al Jazeera. \u201cThe only problem is that our onions are very small due to the weather but those coming from Niger are bigger. We need to find a solution to this situation.\u201d",

        "description": "A natural mutation found in Puerto Rican dairy cows might keep them healthier in extreme heat.",
        "content": "At Vaqueria El Remanso, a small dairy farm west of San Juan, Puerto Rico, the cows are different \u2014 they have a freshly shaven, suave look. Their short hair is the result of a natural mutation known as \u201cslick,\u201d which Rafael L\u00f3pez-L\u00f3pez, who runs El Remanso, has been breeding into his cows for decades. \u201cIn hot, humid conditions, the slick cows have an advantage,\u201d L\u00f3pez-L\u00f3pez said on a scorching spring morning, walking among his herd in the shade of the milking barn. The genetic mutation that gives slick cows a shorter coat and more active sweat glands helps them maintain a healthy body temperature \u2014 an asset on a heating planet. Cows are most comfortable in temperatures between 41 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit, which means livestock around the world are struggling to cope with hotter and longer summers. Over the span of just two hot, humid days of June 2022, an estimated 10,000 cows died in Kansas. Experts say it will only get worse. Decades of breeding dairy cows for increased milk production have made them even more susceptible to heat. \u201cHow do they produce more milk? They eat more, they metabolize more,\u201d said Peter Hansen, a professor of animal sciences at the University of Florida who studies the slick mutation. \u201cSo any cow that\u2019s producing more milk is going to be producing more body heat, which makes it harder to resist heat stress.\u201d When a dairy cow\u2019s temperature rises above her normal core body temperature range of 101.5 to 102.8 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 which happens when the heat index is greater than 72 \u2014 she experiences heat stress, meaning the ability to regulate her internal temperature is compromised. She grazes less (eating about 3-5% less per additional degree of ambient temperature) and has greater difficulty getting pregnant. That, in turn, compromises her milk supply. Heat stress also suppresses the immune system, leaving her more susceptible to disease. Heat stress costs the U.S. dairy industry as much as $670 million annually and scientists predict it could cause a 6.3% drop in milk production by the end of the century. To cope, farmers spend thousands of dollars running massive fans, sprinkler systems, and even fog machines to keep their cows cool. Cows with the slick mutation, however, appear to be coping relatively well. The slick mutation has been identified in at least six different cattle breeds around the world, including in Carora cows in Venezuela and Senepol cows on the Caribbean island of Saint Croix. \u201cIt must be a good mutation or it wouldn\u2019t have been selected for naturally so many times,\u201d said Hansen. In natural selection, individual animals with traits that give them an advantage are more likely to survive and reproduce; the slick mutation appears to offer an advantage for different cow species in hot, humid climates. Dairy farmers are paying closest attention to the slick Holstein. Traditional Holsteins are the top milk-producing cow in terms of volume, but the temperate breed that originated in the Netherlands about 2,000 years ago isn\u2019t well-adapted to heat and humidity. However, studies have shown that Holsteins with the slick mutation are able to keep their body temperature about 1 degree Fahrenheit cooler, meaning their milk production and fertility don\u2019t drop as much as non-slick animals during the hottest months. \u201cI get 1,800 pounds [more] of milk per lactation from these cows and they reproduce more effectively,\u201d said L\u00f3pez-L\u00f3pez. Research is still in its early days \u2014 scientists and farmers say that larger sample sizes will help them better understand how the mutation affects cows in different weather conditions. For example, a 2020 study comparing slick calves in Florida and California showed that the advantages of the mutation were more pronounced in the humid heat of Florida than the dry heat of California. Still, breeding for the slick cows is widely seen as a promising strategy and is being used by farmers in places like South and Central America, Indonesia, Thailand and Qatar. It was listed among adaptations to heat stress in livestock in the IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment Report. \u201cHot parts of the world are getting hotter, and parts of the world where heat stress was just an occasional problem are going to find that it\u2019s a more severe problem,\u201d said Hansen. \u201cThe more the climate is such that cows are exposed to a lot of heat stress, the more important the [slick] gene is going to be.\u201d The slick Holstein likely originated when Holsteins from the U.S. were brought to Puerto Rico in the 1950s to increase milk production on the island. (Puerto Rico produces about 200 million liters of milk each year, making it the island\u2019s top agricultural commodity.) The Holsteins were crossed with Criollo cows, a breed raised for both beef and dairy that\u2019s become heat-tolerant in the centuries since the Spanish colonists introduced them to the island. Scientists suspect that these cows already had the slick mutation and passed it on to the Holsteins. Researchers also think slick cows may be better able to produce reproductive hormones because they\u2019re not spending as much energy releasing heat from their bodies. Esbal Jim\u00e9nez-Cab\u00e1n, professor of animal sciences at the University of Puerto Rico (UPR), pointed out that in both humans and animals, reproduction is among the first biological functions to be compromised in adverse conditions. \u201cIf a guy is stressed, his sperm count goes down. If women don\u2019t eat well, the menstrual cycle goes crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cA wild-type animal, when it\u2019s fighting the heat in the summer, it will prioritize staying alive.\u201d A 2020 study that compared slick and wild-type cows (those without the mutation) on Lop\u00e9z-Lop\u00e9z\u2019s farm showed that the calving interval of the slick cows was about 1.6 months shorter than those without the mutation. That\u2019s valuable for farmers, Jim\u00e9nez-Cab\u00e1n explained. \u201cIf you have an animal who is not producing, you are [still] spending a lot of money on that animal \u2014 so you want to shorten that time as much as you can.\u201d In the mainland U.S., only a small number of farmers, mostly in the South, currently breed the slick gene into their herds \u2014 but that\u2019s starting to change. In 2019, L\u00f3pez-L\u00f3pez sold his bull Sinba to a heat tolerance-focused breeder in Texas; from there, more U.S. breeders bought up Sinba\u2019s semen to start breeding their own slick cows. Jeffrey Bewley, a breeder in Kentucky, began selling slick embryos soon thereafter. Bewley has spent much of his career focused on cattle housing and cooling technologies. (Most dairy cattle in the U.S. are housed in barns with fans \u2014 just 20 percent of lactating cows have \u201csome access\u201d to pasture, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report.) \u201cDespite all of our efforts to try to cool the cow, there\u2019s still effective heat stress,\u201d Bewley said, noting that cows experience heat stress about 150 days of the year in Kentucky. \u201cWhat really resonated with me was the idea that we might be able to breed for an animal that\u2019s better able to handle the heat instead of just changing their environment,\u201d he said.

        "content": "With severe weather systems becoming more constant across the country, a team of multistate agricultural researchers found in a new study that grain bins need to be carefully scrutinized for structural safety, soundness and engineering integrity. The study was prompted by a string of severe weather outbreaks in the Midwest that began in 2020, as well as severe weather that has occurred throughout Texas. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some strong storms across Texas this spring and summer,\u201d said Rebekka Dudensing, Ph.D., Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service economist, professor and associate vice president for the Economic Development and Community Impact unit in the Texas A&M Division of Academic and Strategic Collaborations. The novelty of studying grain bins in Texas as well as the overall safety of structures brought the research team together. The study\u2019s lead investigator is Christine Wittich, University of Nebraska-Lincoln research engineer. Joining Dudensing on the research team are AgriLife Extension economists Dean McCorkle, Ph.D., senior program specialist, and Steven Klose, Ph.D., associate department head, all in the Department of Agricultural Economics of Texas A&M\u2019s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences based in Bryan-College Station. Maria Watson, business and disaster recovery specialist, University of Florida, rounds out the team. \u201cRecovery after a windstorm, like the 2020 Derecho, is a multiyear process for many farmers,\u201d Wittich said. \u201cBased on early responses to the survey we are conducting, common concerns from farmers included the availability of building materials and labor to begin reconstruction for their farm structures. This seems to be a major barrier towards farm recovery.\u201d When asked what advice they would give to other farmers in similar situations, most respondents discussed insurance. \u201cPrimarily, this involved recommendations to know your insurance policy well and to follow up with your agent regularly,\u201d Wittich said. Dudensing said the research team wants to help minimize damage. \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea to check structures for loose panels and to make sure doors and hatches are secured prior to storms,\u201d she said. They also want agricultural businesses to recover quickly and cost-effectively. \u201cThis study will provide information about best practices in construction and in the preparation of structures for storms,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see more grain bins and machine sheds at the edge of fields rather than on farmsteads. Often there are no windbreaks or other buildings to slow windspeeds, so these structures can be more susceptible to damage.\u201d \u201cWhen I visit with producers and discuss their purchase of grain bins, they are expecting these systems to last a lifetime,\u201d said Bryan Davis, AgriLife Extension Disaster Assessment and Recovery team lead, headquartered in District 10, in Seguin. \u201cIt\u2019s a metal structure, engineered so a commodity flows in from the top and through the center. It\u2019s designed that way so grain can evenly distribute into the bin and there is no uneven pressure on one side of the wall. One of the biggest problems we see is when the bins don\u2019t distribute the weight evenly.\u201d Davis said it\u2019s critical to pay attention to these structures and conduct annual inspections to ensure the structure\u2019s integrity. \u201cDuring these inspections, we recommend that producers work in teams with a safety harness and proper PPE,\u201d Davis said. \u201cInspections should include cleaning, inspecting the walls and linings, and reviewing every aspect of the structure.\u201d Producers should also be mindful that the bottom metal rings of the grain bin can rust over time, Davis said. The false floor must also be inspected closely for any defects or sign of wear. \u201cMost of our grain bins are designed with manholes on the top and bottom,\u201d Davis said. \u201cAlways inspect those areas, and never perform any modifications without consulting an engineer.\u201d Davis also recommends checking the footing of the grain bin on a concrete slab. \u201cInspect for cracks or any separation or movement,\u201d he said. This is especially important for those individuals who are using grain bins as part of entertainment venues. \u201cWe advise consulting with an engineer and evaluating the integrity of the structures, ensuring they are structurally stable to withstand a wind event, if and when it occurs,\u201d Davis said. Preliminary findings were compiled as assessments were made of hundreds of steel grain bins following the 2020 August windstorms in Iowa. Another finding was that, after a windstorm, most farmers indicated their insurance adjusters agreed with their assessments of the level of damage for agricultural buildings, center pivot irrigation systems and steel grain bins. \u201cMany farmers indicated they intended for their farm structures to be replaced with enhanced construction that would be more wind resistant,\u201d Wittich said. \u201cHowever, our observations of the replacement structures did not always align with this intent.\u201d She said many farmers want to increase their wind resistance, but their replacement structures may not actually be a significant improvement. \u201cFor example, our structural studies indicate that vertical stiffeners typically provide the most enhancement for wind resistance of a steel grain bin,\u201d Wittich said Future study plans include surveying additional communities impacted by windstorms to generalize findings. Currently, the team is following up with Nebraskan communities after storms last spring and summer. \u201cFrom the engineering standpoint, a lot of our work so far has focused on steel grain bins,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThese are very common structures that had widespread damage in our first study community following the 2020 Derecho. We are now expanding our focus to other farm structures, including center pivot irrigation systems and ag buildings \u2014 both metal and wood-framed. We plan to assess what are the key variables that predict wind resistance.\u201d Watson said there has not been extensive research on farm recovery following disasters. \u201cWe are conducting surveys to better understand what that process looks like after windstorms and to help create that type of guidance for agricultural businesses: What challenges farmers and ranchers face during recovery, what resources are most helpful, and how to better prepare for future events,\u201d she said. Watson said the surveys are especially helpful in understanding the overall recovery of a farm. \u201cWhat impact does grain bin damage have on the long-term capacity and profitability of the farm, and what strategies might be used by farmers to reduce any secondary losses?\u201d Farmer response rates and overall reception to the study was positive, according to the researchers, who are evaluating a follow up study. -30-",

As with many crypto exchanges, there are also two ways to fund your account: fiat money or existing cryptocurrencies. Plus, you can only purchase up to $1,000 per day with debit cards. And when it comes to withdrawals, you must take out a minimum of $50. Can You Trust Gemini? Gemini currently has an F rating with the Better Business Bureau due to a failure to respond to multiple complaints, failure to resolve underlying causes for complaints, and the length of time the business takes to respond to a complaint. The BBB also notes that most complaints filed against Gemini after January 2021 were due to customers being unable to access bitcoin in their Gemini account. Many users also believe that Gemini's verification process for withdrawals and transfers slows transactions. In November 2022, Genesis stopped Gemini Earn investors from withdrawing crypto from their accounts due to Genesis' lack of sufficient liquid assets to meet withdrawal requests. The Gemini Earn program was then terminated . In February 2022, a Gemini crypto hack led to the loss of roughly $37 million in assets of clients with crypto IRAs held through IRA Financial Trust. IRA Financial Trust sued Gemini, and both Gemini and IRA Financial Trusts became the targets of client lawsuits. On January 12, 2023, the SEC charged a complaint against Genesis and Gemini, claiming unregistered offer and sale of securities to retail investors through the Earn program. As of September 2023, Gemini is pushing for a federal judge to dismiss SEC's claims for insufficient evidence. The charges are still pending. Is Coinbase Right for You? Pros More than 250 cryptocurrencies available Coinbase One subscription includes $1 million in account protection, zero trading fees, and 24/7 priority support Two trading options for advanced users: Coinbase Pro and Coinbase Advanced Trade Can earn up to 6% in interest; users can take advantage of a Coinbase non-custodial wallet if they choose to store their assets through the platform Cons Lower balances result in higher fees Limited staking options Who Coinbase is Best For Coinbase is best for active individual investors and institutions looking to benefit from account flexibility.

Can You Trust Coinbase? Coinbase has an F rating from the Better Business Bureau due to the business' failure to respond to over 2,000 complaints. There are also multiple lawsuits currently filed against Coinbase. Coinbase agreed to a settlement with the New York State Department of Financial Services in 2022 after the New York DFS claimed Coinbase didn't want to comply with the NY banking law and DFS regulations. Coinbase paid a $50 million penalty. In 2023, the SEC started investigating Coinbase after against Coinbase on June 6, 2023. The lawsuit claims that Coinbase offered crypto trading on its unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency \u2014 and that Coinbase allowed sales on its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program. Coinbase's CEO denies these allegations and is attempting to dismiss the charges. Gemini vs. Coinbase \u2014 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Is Gemini better than Coinbase?

        "description": "Read our Luno review and learn why we recommend this exchange for online trading and why it is not a scam, learn all you need to know in this Luno review before you sign up with the exchange. The post Luno Review \u2013 Is Luno Exchange Scam or Legit? (complete luno.com review) first appeared on Tokenhell.",
        "content": "Luno Review So why do people search long and hard for a cryptocurrency exchange? What is the point of it? What benefits does an online exchange provide? All these questions will be answered in great detail, so read very carefully. Luno is a cryptocurrency exchange, and I have chosen to write this Luno review to help you understand the importance of having a really good exchange in the market. For those of you who are interested in trading cryptocurrencies, then Luno is a really good option. As many people might already be aware, this market is filled to the brim with options in exchanges. You will discover so many platforms offering you these services and promising you the help to make your trading career really successful. But not every exchange is able to provide that service. This platform, by the name of Luno, offers its customers the chance to trade cryptocurrencies. It is another exchange, but it is not like the rest. If you are interested in carrying out trades in Ethereum and bitcoin, then Luno is definitely the best way for you to go. Because, unlike other exchanges that provide lots of options, Luno only provides its customers with these two cryptocurrencies. But what those exchanges lack is specialization, yes they do provide a variety, but customers struggle to cope with it and do not succeed in trades. One reason can be that customers get confused due to so many options or that they do not receive focused training and help. This is why Luno has chosen to minimize its options and limit it to just two. But the two cryptocurrencies it has chosen, Ethereum and Bitcoin, are both the leading cryptocurrencies in the whole world. These two have proved to be the most successful, and that is why Luno\u2019s customers are one of the luckiest. When you choose Luno as the exchange to work with, you will realize how progressive it is and that it prioritizes its customers and their ease above everything. Luno has its own individual apps, one for the wallet and for the payment as well. The sole purpose of this app is to provide customers with the easiest way to send or get cryptocurrencies. You can also spend cryptocurrencies or fiat through this app. It makes the whole process really quick, and this way, you can continue working while being on the move. Although there are many exchanges in the market, not all of them are this considerate or innovative. Therefore if you are looking for a cryptocurrency exchange that has continued to update and develop with the passage of time, then Luno is definitely the one. It also provides its customers with the chance to increase their knowledge, and those who are interested can access the portal for education material. This is called \u2018Luno Learning,\u2019 or you can opt for the blog instead. The blog is also targeted at beginners who might be a little lost and not ready for trading top cryptocurrencies. That is why Luno has provided the resources its customers would need to know better. This will be discussed in more detail later on. Another good thing about Luno is that it makes the process of using your cryptocurrencies really easy. This has been a challenge in the crypto world as many platforms do not care whether customers would be able to convert the cryptocurrencies into the exchange they wish to use. On the Luno site, you do not have to worry about this. Once you have gotten the cryptocurrencies, you can easily convert them into any currency you wish to use. There is no time limit on this either. Luno has many features and services to offer, which makes it a very unique and distinct cryptocurrency exchange. These will be discussed down below. This cryptocurrency exchange was initially introduced in 2013. But back then, it was introduced by the name of BitX, and then in 2016, the exchange was changed to Luno. This exchange has three offices in total, which are located in various places. These are Singapore, London, and Capetown. It is one of the most successful companies and has become very popular in the market. A total of 3 million people have worked with Luno, and they belong to at least 40 different countries. Although it is quite a successful company, it is run by 100 employees. This company is mainly settled in the UK and has managed to raise a lot of money from investors, which totals an amount of 13 million. Two of Luno\u2019s most prominent investors have been the Digital Currency Group and Ventura Capital. A noteworthy feature of this platform is that it provides its customers with five options in fiat currencies to trade the bitcoin against. These are the Malaysian Ringgit, South African Rand, Euro, Nigerian Naira, and Indonesian Rupiah. This exchange offers its customers whatever price is set in the market. But cryptocurrencies can immediately be bought or sold at a price set by the exchange. Businesses that are interested in offering their customers the chance to pay in cryptocurrencies or other things can also open a business account with Luno. Luno is a cryptocurrency exchange that offers many bitcoin crypto pairs. But other than that, you can also trade in Ethereum. However, the only limitation is that coins such as Ripple cannot be bought. So let\u2019s take a look at the accepted pairs and options for cryptocurrencies. This is an exchange that decreases the trading fees for those that buy or those that sell according to the increase of the trading volume. If you are located in Malaysia or Europe, then the fees for depositing are completely free. However, if you are located in Indonesia, South Africa, or Nigeria, then you will be charged a fee when you deposit an amount. The fee for withdrawing an amount is very minimum, but it exists. This varies depending on which country you reside in. For instance, if it is Europe, then the fee is 0.30 per withdrawal. Also, if you receive or send money through bitcoin, then a certain fee will be charged too. Every platform is different and therefore has different features and services to offer. At Luno, you will know that most of these features are created with the notion to provide customers with the simplest and quickest ways to trade. The dashboard is another factor that proves this. It provides a simple buying or selling service to its customers. The purpose of this is to simplify the process and have these exchanges occur at a rapid rate. This way, you can easily purchase Bitcoin or Ethereum and not have to wait for a really long time. It also eradicates the procedure that many other platforms have implemented, which includes using sites for trading that are very complicated and confusing. So the best thing about this platform and dashboard is that through Luno, you can instantly buy whatever coins you require and just pay the fees to Luno for it. The fees depend on many factors, as discussed earlier. Fees can vary depending on the country or type of cryptocurrencies. This is a great feature as it has helped many traders to trade their cryptocurrencies easily. To make it even better, customers can access features such as charting, which is highly advanced. This helps while you trade and make decisions in the market regarding cryptocurrencies. Many professionals also use the charting tool so that their trades can be better. This is a tool that is important as it helps with the trading strategy and reduces the loss or the risks that you could potentially face. You will also find that Luno allows its users access to automated trading. This is a feature that has been very popular in the crypto world. It has helped many traders to increase their revenues because automated trading is very quick and happens constantly. This means that even if you are busy or multitasking, even then, your trades or exchanges will continue to happen, and revenue will continue to generate. Other than this, you can also use indicators while trading, these help in studying and analyzing the market deeply. Through this tool, customers get the chance to study trends that have occurred in the market, whether they are old or new. The sole purpose of indicators is that they improve your decisions because your knowledge of the market increases, so that ensures that whatever you decide is not void of any information. If you are interested in maximizing your profits and minimizing your losses, then do consider these features while choosing your crypto exchange. As participating in the trading market is not an easy thing, and to ensure that you are succeeding, you need to cooperate with an exchange that is progressive and has beneficial features to offer. Reports are another essential feature as they too play an important role in providing updates on the market and cryptocurrencies. This way, you can constantly be aware of what trading opportunity would provide you with the highest profits. Reports are basically regular updates on markets, on trades, cryptocurrency pairs, and others that keep traders up to date and ensure that they do not miss out on any important information. If you want to perform well in the market, then these tools are a must as they are very helpful. A disadvantage to many traders can be that the trading volume at Luno is not a lot. It is very less when compared to some other platforms, but one of the reasons for it is that this platform targets users of the developed markets. This means those traders who are interested in keeping up with markets that are progressive and more in touch with technology will be the most satisfied by Luno. As mentioned earlier, this is a great feature. For those of you who are constantly traveling or cannot keep on carrying a laptop with you would really appreciate this feature. Luno offers its users the chance to download the app for Bitcoin Wallet. This is directly linked to your account, and this way, you can send, receive or use your funds at any time without any restriction. The app is compatible with both iOS and Android devices. The downside of this is that rather than you having control for your Bitcoins, it is the Luno platform that has the control. A feature that customers highly appreciate is when they can pay, withdraw and spend in different ways. But this is a rare feature to be seen in the market as not many exchanges offer this. But Luno is once again a distinct platform, and to make trading easier for its customers, many options for payment have been provided. When a platform provides different payment methods, this helps users by allowing them to choose the method which is most convenient for the one that would not require a lot of time to be taken up or be a long and complicated procedure. So Luno does provide options. However, they vary depending on the currency or country too. Customers interested in dealing in EUR currency can choose credit or debit cards, SEPA, Sofort, or iDeal. Those who want NGN can choose Flutterwave, GT bank transfer, Paystack, or card deposit. For ZAR, you can choose from a cash deposit penalty or EFT. For IDR, you can choose a bank wire transfer, and for MYR, you can choose Interbank Giro. Luno is a really good platform because it provides a diverse plan for accounts. This way, traders can choose one that really suits them without bearing the burden of unnecessary expenses or not being experienced enough for the account. These are based on your level of account verification. is based on email verification, and this means that you cannot deposit or withdraw anything at all. is based on phone verification, and this allows users to deposit or withdraw any amount till 1000 Euros, but that is it. is based on ID verification, and this allows users to deposit or withdraws an amount to 5000 Euros that is per month. which is the final level is based on proof of your residence, and this allows users to deposit or withdraw an amount to 100,000 Euros, that is per month too. Currently, this platform is not regulated, but it has plans to become regular as this has become a winning feature in the market. It has planned to become regulated in at least 4 or 5 markets so that it can assure its customers of its safety while also being recognized as a legal platform. This platform has also implemented security measures that are on a bank-grade level. This ensures the safety of funds and keeps them protected so that no unwanted person can access funds. Luno is also a platform that has ensured that every customer\u2019s key, which is a form of protection, is stored in a deep freeze that is a very secure place. It refers to boxes of safety deposits that are in bank vaults, and every security deposit is only accessible by one person. A person cannot access more than that, which ensures that every individual gets the chance to a secure trading platform and cannot intermingle with any other. The information of customers is also encrypted so that hackers or scammers cannot use the information. There are some other security measures as well, including two-factor authentication, which are also incorporated within the system. It is safe to say that Luno takes the security of customers and the funds very seriously. This was also mentioned earlier. Whether you are a beginner or an expert in trading, knowledge is always important. This is because as the world is progressing, so is the technology, and so is the crypto world. Therefore Luno prioritizes education for its users so they can keep in touch with all the necessary information and updates on the market. On the site, you can access the Learning Portal or the blog. Both provide resources for traders to access. These are important as they are provided with the intention that customers get educated. They gain more knowledge so that they can learn the basics, skills, and strategies to help while trading. We all know how competitive the market is and that there are so many options for everything. In this case, there are many exchanges to choose from, but not all are worth it. To ensure that your experience is the best and that whichever exchange you choose helps you in trading rather than being the reason for your loss means that you have to choose wisely. So always remember to do proper research before choosing. This is why a review on Luno has been written so that you can choose easily. Luno is by far one of those trading platforms that make it easy to use cryptocurrencies within the real world. It helps customers by simplifying the trading process and spending whatever cryptocurrencies they can get a hand on.",

        "content": "Happy 173 rd birthday, California ! On Sept. 9, 1850, California became the 31 st state to be admitted to the Union after the Compromise of 1850 was signed by then-President Millard Fillmore. California became a state relatively quickly, as the Gold Rush that started in 1848 \u2013 just days after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed between the U.S. and Mexico, which ceded most of the Southwest and all of present-day California to the states \u2013 led to an influx of settlers, and a hasty constitutional convention was held the following year. It was at this convention that the state seal that we all know today was created. The seal features 31 stars, symbolizing California\u2019s admission as the 31 st state, as well as the Greek goddess Athena, a grizzly bear feeding on grape vines and the state motto \u201cEureka.\u201d Also included in the seal\u2019s complex imagery are nods to what the state\u2019s founders thought were important issues, including mining, farming and water transportation, the California Capitol Museum said . The seal itself was designed by a career military officer named Robert S. Garnett, who later fought in the Civil War in Virginia for the Confederacy and died during the Battle of Corrick\u2019s Ford near present-day Parsons, West Virginia. In the Golden State\u2019s early days, the capital moved frequently; by the time Sacramento was designated as the center of the state government in 1854, the state legislature had already convened in San Jose, Vallejo and the small town of Benicia, according to the California Department of Parks and Recreation . And while Admission Day is now a little-known holiday, it used to be quite a large celebration, the Los Angeles Times said . An undated photo of Echo Lake cityscape over Los Angeles skyline.

Aug. 2023 (NPS) In 1925, Orange County was decorated with Diamond Jubilee colors commemorating the state\u2019s 75 th anniversary, and nearly 200,000 people flocked to the streets of Santa Monica in 1937 to watch a five-mile parade depicting periods of California history. By the mid-1970s, a bill that would have \u201ckilled off\u201d Admission Day made its way to Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s desk, but he vetoed it in 1976. However, the holiday was scrapped in 1984 by Gov. George Deukmejian and turned into a \u201cflabby, floating day off work for state employees,\u201d the L.A. Times said. Regardless of how large \u2014 or small \u2014 the festivities are, a lot has happened since the birth of what has now become the most populated state in the country. Complete with multiple metropolises and a gross domestic product that would rank 5th in the world if it were an independent nation, California has flourished into one of the most important parts of not just the United States, but the entire globe.

        "description": "Buthelezi, a veteran South African politician, who was once a rival to former President Nelson Mandela, has passed away.",
        "content": "Mangosuthu Buthelezi, a veteran South African politician and Zulu prince, has died at the age of 95, the presidency said on Saturday. The founder of the Inkatha Freedom Party served two terms as minister of home affairs in the post-apartheid government after burying the hatchet with the governing African National Congress party (ANC) in 1994. \u201cI am deeply saddened to announce the passing of Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Prince of KwaPhindangene, Traditional Prime Minister to the Zulu Monarch and Nation, and the Founder and President Emeritus of the Inkatha Freedom Party,\u201d President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a statement. Buthelezi, who was a controversial figure during the apartheid liberation struggle, had a procedure for back pain in July and was later readmitted to hospital when the pain did not subside, according to local news website News24. He founded the IFP in 1975 as a national cultural movement that became a political force in what is now KwaZulu-Natal province, and his party was embroiled in bloody conflicts with the ANC in the 1980s and 1990s. His last-minute decision to participate in the first post-apartheid election in 1994 brought peace between the two parties. The vote brought the ANC and its leader, the late Nelson Mandela, to power after decades of white minority rule. The Nelson Mandela Foundation said Buthelezi\u2019s life intersected at multiple points with Mandela\u2019s and that his legacy was an \u201cimposing and complex one\u201d. \u201cIn many ways, the two leaders came to embody an understanding of a reconciliation which had no need of forgiveness, nor forgetting of the past, nor even of learning to like one another \u2013 it was simply about determining to get on together,\u201d the foundation said in a statement. South Africa\u2019s main opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) party described Buthelezi as a \u201cgreat leader\u201d. \u201cPrince Buthelezi was a giant on South Africa\u2019s political landscape,\u201d DA leader John Steenhuisen said. Buthelezi grew up in a traditional household, spending his early years as a herdboy. In 1953, he was installed as acting chief of the prominent Buthelezi clan and four years later was confirmed as chief. He was married to Irene Mzila, a nurse, eschewing the polygamy followed by many Zulu chiefs. They had three sons and four daughters. Buthelezi was a champion of his people and a prominent figure in the struggle against apartheid but his rivalry with the ANC led to fraught days and much bloodshed before South Africa was able to elect its first Black leader. Critics dubbed Buthelezi a \u201cwarlord\u201d but to his legion of followers in the rural Zulu heartland, he was a visionary. For a decade before the end of white rule in 1994, Buthelezi \u2013 dressed in leopard skins and waving a short silver-topped stick \u2013 was a familiar sight at rallies while Inkatha was embroiled in conflict with the ANC. About 20,000 people were killed and hundreds of thousands forced from their homes as fighting raged in KwaZulu and in men\u2019s hostels built to house migrant labourers who toiled in the gold mines near Johannesburg. The price for peace was Buthelezi\u2019s participation in a government of national unity as minister of home affairs \u2013 a ministry that became a byword for corruption and incompetence under his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s not pleasant, it\u2019s not easy for me. Neither is it easy for President Thabo Mbeki [Mandela\u2019s successor] to have me and my colleagues in the cabinet. We did it to end a low-intensity civil war,\u201d Buthelezi told Reuters in an interview in July 2003. He was also cast in other roles away from politics. Buthelezi played his own great-grandfather King Cetshwayo in the 1964 film, Zulu, which immortalised the 1879 defence of Rorke\u2019s Drift by British troops against thousands of Zulu fighters but also spread the image of the Zulus beyond South Africa as mighty warriors. Longevity marked his political career. He only stepped down as the IFP\u2019s leader in 2019, aged 90. Long-winded speeches were a Buthelezi trademark. Delivered in Zulu or English, they could go on for hours. Attending the Black University of Fort Hare from 1948 to 1950, Buthelezi joined the ANC Youth League and rubbed shoulders in lecture halls with many of the movement\u2019s future leaders. He was expelled for his political activity there. His political clout would be forged in the KwaZulu \u201cBantustan\u201d one of the so-called self-governing homelands based on tribal affiliation \u2013 islands of rural poverty where most Black South Africans were literally confined under apartheid. A Zulu chief, Buthelezi became KwaZulu\u2019s chief minister in the 1970s, where he tried a delicate balancing act: refusing outright independence and criticising Pretoria\u2019s racial policies while still playing a role in the homeland farce. It was too much for the ANC, whose leaders in exile tried to court him throughout the 1970s before giving up in the face of rank-and-file opposition to what was seen as Buthelezi\u2019s collaboration with the apartheid regime.",

Sep 8, 2023, 05:24pm EDT | Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The best memory foam pillows are responsive, durable and excellent at maintaining spinal alignment while you sleep. This makes them a great option for any sleepers who wake up with neck or shoulder pain (or are just tired of the sinking feeling of down pillows ). According to orthopedic spine and neck surgeon Dr. Rahul Shah , \u201cmemory foam allows pillows to conform to one\u2019s body structure, and this lets the pillow accommodate the natural resting position.\u201d As a result, the pillow \u201cdoesn\u2019t create any undue pressure points.\u201d The best memory foam pillow overall is the Tempur-Pedic Tempur-Cloud because it's cooling, ... [+] supportive and comes in two different height options. ILLUSTRATION: FORBES / PHOTO: RETAILER But memory foam pillows come in several different types\u2014shredded, one-piece, layered and contoured\u2014which impacts the overall feel of the pillow. \u201cPillow shape and content play an important role in maintaining cervical spine curvature for support, in order to reduce neck fatigue,\u201d says orthopedic surgeon Dr. Gregory Gasbarro . We kept this advice in mind when compiling our list of the best memory foam pillows. Our top overall pick is the Tempur-Pedic Tempur Cloud because of its dual-sided cooling gel, medium-firm feel and removable cover. However, we\u2019ve evaluated and tried out other pillows, too. Read on to see the rest of our favorites.

The pillow is filled with a medium-support foam interior that cradles your head, neck and shoulders while you snooze. Worth noting: In true Tempur-Pedic style, this foam won\u2019t lose it shape or pancake out on you with time. It also has a removable (and washable) cover with a cooling gel layer to help keep nighttime sweatiness at bay. What the reviews say: The Tempur Cloud has hundreds of happy reviewers who praise its cooling comfort in all sleeping positions. One calls it the \u201cbest pillow on the market,\u201d while another writes, \u201cThis pillow is incredibly comfortable with a medium-firm feel.\u201d forbes.com Tempur-Pedic Promo Codes | 30% Off In September 2023 | Forbes Best Memory Foam Pillow For Neck Pain A Curvy Pick Designed For Pain Relief Amazon Epabo Contour Memory Foam Pillow (Queen) Buy From Amazon Height: 4.6, 4.8, or 5 inches | Washable: Cover only | Key features: Ergonomic design, breathable foam, choice of sizes This pillow from Epabo has an ergonomic design that\u2019s specifically contoured to help support your head, neck and shoulders while you sleep. Thanks to these features, it\u2019s one of the best pillows for neck pain available today. The pillow works for side, back and stomach sleepers, and its breathable memory foam helps keep night sweats at bay. Happen to spill something on your pillow? Just zip off the cover and put it in the wash. Choose between two different heights of standard and queen sizes for that just-right fit. What the reviews say : \u201cThis pillow is super soft and supportive, and my neck pain has not returned,\u201d one customer writes, as another shares, \u201cIt provides great support for my neck.

Two layers of Tempur-Pedic\u2019s proprietary cooling gel sandwich a single piece of Tempur foam, making for an adaptive and supportive pillow that feels cool to the touch. Because of this, it\u2019s our favorite cooling pillow right now. According to the company, the pillow has a medium feel and stable support accommodates any sleeping position (though stomach sleepers may find it\u2019s a bit too thick for comfort). Plus, the Tempur foam means it won\u2019t lose its shape or require fluffing, like some down and down alternative pillows do. The Tempur-Cloud Breeze Dual Cooling Pillow comes in king and queen sizes, and while you can\u2019t chuck the whole pillow in the machine, the quilted cotton cover can be zipped off for easy machine washing. What our editors say: \u201cIf you overheat at night, the Tempur-Cloud Breeze is a great option,\u201d says senior strategy editor Katie Simpson. \u201cI've woken up hot for as long as I can remember.

You can remove the gel insert for spot cleaning and toss the outer cover and inner insert in the wash. Choose between standard or queen sizes, depending on your personal preference. What the reviews say : Self-described side sleepers have high praise for the Lessa Hybrid. One says it\u2019s \u201cwonderful for side sleeping! Soft enough yet sturdy enough to offer great support.\u201d Another writes, \u201cOur favorite thing about the pillow is the high profile (great for side sleepers, even with broad shoulders).\u201d Best Memory Foam Pillow On Amazon A Soft, Fluffy Pillow With A No-Shift Construction Amazon Weekender Ventilated Gel Memory Foam Pillow (Queen) Buy From Amazon Height: 5 inches | Washable: Cover only | Key features: CertiPUR-US-certified foam, ventilated design, choice of sizes Made from CertiPUR US-certified memory foam , this soft, fluffy foam pillow is designed to contour your neck and shoulders for a comfortable night\u2019s sleep.

What the reviews say : \u201cI\u2019ve got terrible allergies and this stuffing doesn\u2019t bother me at all.\u201d says one customer. Another writes \u201cwe both also have multiple environmental allergies/sensitivities and this pillow has not caused us any problems.\u201d Best Memory Foam Pillow For Stomach Sleepers An Adjustable Pillow To Kick The Crick In Your Neck LUXOME LAYR Customizable Pillow Buy From Amazon Height: Adjustable | Washable: Yes | Key features: Adjustable with a zipper, CertiPUR-US-certified, cooling cover, choice of sizes The LAYR pillow is designed for personalization. One side is filled with a soft down alternative, while the other is a medium-feeling layer of gel-infused shredded memory foam. The pillow comes with a separate, solid memory foam insert for an even firmer feel, if you find it isn\u2019t quite enough as is. Prefer a low, soft pillow while you snooze on your stomach? LAYR recommends layering the down alternative insert over the solid memory foam for a dreamy-soft pillow that maintains alignment. For something a little firmer, try removing the down alternative and stacking the memory foam layers. The idea is to add and remove layers until you land on the perfect balance of comfort and support. What the reviews say : \u201cI am a back, side, stomach, everything sleeper and it is perfect for it all,\u201d writes one buyer. Another says, \u201cmy sleep patterns and positions change all the time (I cycle through sleeping on my back, sides, and stomach) and this pillow makes all of those comfortable.\u201d Best Memory Foam Pillow For Back Sleepers A Dense Pillow That Strikes A Balance Between Support And Cushioning Tuft and Needle Tuft & Needle Original Foam Pillow Buy From Tuft & Needle Height: 5 inches | Washable: Cover only | Key features: Greenguard Gold and CertiPUR-US-certified, cooling, multiple sizes The Original Foam Pillow from Tuft & Needle is all the things a memory foam pillow should be\u2014soft, gently conforming and cooling so your head and neck are supported all night long. The foam in this pillow is infused with graphite and cooling gel to minimize overheating, and the pillow has the right balance of squish and support to ensure the kind of alignment back sleepers need. An added bonus? The cover can be removed for machine washing. What our writers say : Contributor Margaret Eby calls the Tuft & Needle Original a \u201csolid memory foam option\u201d in her best pillows review, adding that it \u201cdid well in my loft and heat tests.\u201d However, she \u201cfound it more difficult to shift sleep positions while using this pillow.\u201d Best Adjustable Memory Foam Pillow A Customizable Option For Picky Sleepers Coop Home Goods Coop Home Goods The Original Pillow Height: Adjustable | Washable: Cover only | Key features: Greenguard Gold and CertiPUR-US certified, choice of sizes For sleepers who want an option they can customize to their liking, we recommend Coop Home Goods Original Pillow. A half-pound bag of extra filling\u2014what Coop calls \u201coomph\u201d\u2014means you can add or remove until you find just the right loft, no matter how you sleep. Among one of the best pillows we\u2019ve tested to date, it\u2019s filled with a blend of hypoallergenic, non-toxic memory foam and microfiber, wrapped in a breathable bamboo-derived fabric. The result is a soft, supportive pillow that accommodates just about every sleeper. What our writers say: \u201cThe Coop Home Goods Pillow was one of the more comfortable memory foam pillows I tested,\u201d contributor Margaret Eby writes in her review. \u201cI\u2019m usually a stomach sleeper, but recently I\u2019ve been trying to sleep on my side to help with back pain, and I found that the Coop Home Goods Original Loft Pillow was the easiest pillow to make that transition.\u201d Best Firm Memory Foam Pillow A Supportive Pillow That Holds Up Your Head And Neck Saatva Saatva Graphite Memory Foam Pillow (Queen) Buy From Saatva Height: 6.5 inches | Washable: Cover only | Key features: CertiPUR-US certified, choice of king and queen sizes, removable cover made with organic cotton Saatva\u2019s Graphite Memory Foam Pillow is a great option for those looking for a firm pillow that doesn\u2019t skimp on comfort. This pillow has an ultra-supportive core made from natural latex and non-toxic shredded memory foam. The result? Sturdy support for your head and neck. Moving outward, the pillow\u2019s middle layer contains graphite-infused memory foam for extra breathability. The combination of these layers gives the pillow a dense feel that holds the body without flattening. If you\u2019re hesitant to buy the pillow without trying it first\u2014especially since it\u2019s on the pricier side\u2014Saatva offers a 45-day trial period so you can try it in the comfort of your home. What the reviews say : \u201cI suffer from positional vertigo and had troubling finding a firm memory foam pillow that will help support my head. This pillow is firm BUT soft for your head and neck. I no longer have a stiff neck. It\u2019s the best pillow I have every purchased.\u201d MORE FROM FORBES VETTED 14 Of The Best Work Pants For Women, From Casual To Dressy Options By Anneke Knot Contributor The 15 Best Loafers For Women That Consistently Earn Top Reviews By Katherine Louie Forbes Staff Why Trust Forbes Vetted Having evaluated countless pillows featured in dozens of bedding guides , the Forbes Vetted team knows the ins and outs of sleep. From the best mattresses to the softest sheets , our editors have robust hands-on experience with many of these products, including executive strategy editor Lindsay Boyers and senior strategy editor Katie Simpson. Each have spent years formally testing the latest mattresses and bedding products. When it comes to the best memory foam pillows, several of our picks\u2014including the Tempur-Cloud Breeze Dual Cooling Pillow , Tuft & Needle Original Foam Pillow and Coop Home Goods The Original \u2014were tested firsthand by our team. We also consulted with several medical professionals on the impact of memory foam pillows on your sleep and body overall. We spoke to New Jersey-based board-certified orthopedic spine and neck surgeon Dr. Rahul Shah, orthopedic surgeon at Mercy Medical Center Dr. Gregory Gasbarro and assistant professor in the department of kinesiology and health at Rutgers University Andrea Spaeth . Shah and Gasbarro informed us of the benefits of memory foam pillows, while Spaeth provided insight on how memory foam pillows fare for different sleeping positions. This guide is regularly updated to keep it accurate and relevant. It was last refreshed by mattress updates writer Alex Garrett in September 2023 to name a winner for the best firm memory foam pillow and the best adjustable memory foam pillow. How We Chose The Best Memory Foam Pillows The best memory foam pillows were chosen after intensive research and recommendations from Forbes Vetted staff. As mentioned above, the Tempur-Cloud Breeze Dual Cooling Pillow , Tuft & Needle Original Foam Pillow and Coop Home Goods The Original came personally recommended by our writers and contributors. As for the other memory foam pillows on this list, we\u2019re confident they\u2019re among the best because we thoroughly vetted them against criteria like material quality, loft, fill type (shredded, one-piece, layered or contoured), firmness and special characteristics that promote pressure relief and breathability. Each memory foam pillow listed above aligns with our high standards for each of these features and meets the criteria of a quality memory foam pillow. Aside from specs, we prioritized memory foam pillows with great reviews, too; you won\u2019t find a pillow on our list that has an average rating below 4 stars. Finally, we included pillows for a variety of budgets and sleeping positions, so you can easily find an option to match your needs. How Do I Choose A Memory Foam Pillow? Memory foam is among the most popular bedding options on the market, so it can be tough to pinpoint which one is best for you. All memory foam pillows are adaptive, but how you choose one depends on your sleeping preferences. A block of solid foam will be firmer and more robust, so it\u2019s best for someone who stays in one position throughout the night. Solid block memory foam can also be contoured or flat. A flat option is versatile for various types of sleepers, while contoured pillows hold the neck and head in specific positions, so they\u2019re better for people who really stay put in bed. Shredded foam, on the other hand, is softer and more responsive, which is ideal for sleepers who frequently change positions. Is Memory Foam A Good Material For A Pillow? While there\u2019s no perfect pillow that suits every individual, memory foam pillows are a popular option. If your existing pillow sinks while you sleep and you wake up with shoulder, neck or head pain, a memory foam pillow may be a good fit for you because it\u2019s firmer and holds its shape overnight. Are Memory Foam Pillows Good For Side Sleepers? Yes! Memory foam pillows suit most sleeping styles, including side sleeping , because they provide support for the head and neck. Because they contour to the shape of your body, they\u2019re also ideal for individuals who change positions throughout the night. However, there\u2019s not much research to suggest that memory foam pillows are better for any one kind of sleep position, according to Andrea Spaeth, Ph.D., assistant professor in the department of kinesiology and health at Rutgers University. However, she says, \u201cpeople who sleep on their backs may perceive memory foam pillows as more comfortable because they retain their shape.\u201d Ultimately, whether a memory foam pillow is right for you comes down to personal preference, Dr. Rahul Shah says. If you like a really firm pillow, a memory foam pillow may not be right for you, he says. But, overall, Shah says, there are \u201cminimal\u201d drawbacks to using a memory foam pillow.

MORE FROM FORBES VETTED The Best Work Clothes For Women That Mean Business (Casual) By Becky Eaton Contributor The Best iPads For Kids: Making Sense Of Apple\u2019s Tablet Choices By Tyler Hayes Contributor Why Trust Forbes Vetted Here at Forbes Vetted, we approach all of our product recommendations with transparency and a critical eye. Readers trust us to provide the most accurate information available, so we consider our own experiences in the field and weigh that against testimonials from customers who\u2019ve tried the loafers, themselves. As a team, we've tried on, evaluated and put a lot of clothing and accessories through the ringer to rate the performance, quality and value for your money. Our passion for high-quality footwear includes recommendations for the best workout shoes for women , as well as other topics, such as the most comfortable flats and the most comfortable sneakers for everyday wear. To make sure you get the most accurate information possible, we regularly update this list with relevant details. This story was last updated in August 2023. How We Chose The Best Loafers For Women To determine the best loafers for women, we read hundreds of product reviews and evaluated options from both established and newer-to-market brands. We ultimately chose the best loafers for women by determining which pairs were consistently top-rated by customers, had attractive design elements and received excellent marks for comfort, support and durability. We also considered if the shoes were available in a wide range of sizes, widths and colors and price points. The final products on this list reflect several weeks' worth of in-depth research and personal vetting. Should I Size Up Or Down When Buying Loafers? The fit around the widest point of your foot (typically the ball of your foot) should feel snug\u2014but not tight or constricting. The same goes for the toe box, which is the part of the shoe that covers your toes; it shouldn\u2019t pinch or squeeze your toes there. If those areas feel tight or uncomfortable, that\u2019s a good sign you might need to size up. Keep in mind that certain materials, such as leather, might feel snug after the first wear but will stretch out over time. If your loafers feel tight right out of the box, wear them around the house with thick socks to help them stretch out a bit. If that doesn\u2019t do the trick, consider exchanging them for a different size. How Do I Know My Size In Loafers? To accurately measure your foot, lay a ruler flat on the ground, with one end touching the wall. Stand with your back up against the wall and note the distance from the wall to the tip of your big toe (or whichever toe is the longest). Record this measurement in inches. Now, measure the width of your foot. Place the ruler back on the ground and step onto it with the widest part of your foot (usually this over the balls of your feet). Record the distance from one end of your foot to the other. After you\u2019ve recorded the length and width, look at the size chart for the loafers you\u2019re considering, and make the most accurate decision. Pro tip: It\u2019s a good idea to measure your foot at the end of the day to account for any swelling. How Do I Choose A Pair Of Loafers? The right pair of loafers for you will largely depend on your preferences. However, the most important things to consider are sizing, materials, comfort and design elements, such as buckles and metal hardware. If you stand all day and need a shoe that minimizes arches and pains, look for elements like a cushioned insole, flexible uppers and arch support. Leather is the most popular material for loafers because it looks polished and wears well over time, but suede and velvet are excellent choices due to their soft hand feel and flexibility. (They\u2019re also a great way to add sophistication to an outfit.) Design elements are a matter of personal choice, and range from statement-making tassels to demure buckles, so make sure to look at all of the options and see what grabs your attention. We always recommend shopping retailers that have generous and hassle-free return policies (if possible), so you can feel the materials and assess the fit before fully committing to any pair of shoes.

        "description": "Convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout, the so-called Merchant of Death exchanged for WNBA star Brittney Griner, says he and Griner were \"pawns.\"",
        "content": "Russian Viktor Bout, the so-called Merchant of Death involved in a prisoner exchange for WNBA star Brittney Griner in December, says he followed Griner's case closely from federal prison in Illinois and learned he was being swapped for her when guards came to his cell with boxes early the morning of his release. In an exclusive interview with ESPN, Bout says he recalled hearing a knock on his cell door and being told, \"Hey, you know, wake up and pack up. You're leaving.\" \"Then,\" Bout recalled, \"I realized, yes, I'm going home.\" Bout, 56, and Griner, 32, were freed and returned to their respective countries Dec. 8, 2022, in a dramatic prisoner exchange on the tarmac of an airport in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Since his release, Bout has declared his support for Russian President Vladimir Putin and the invasion of Ukraine and has been nominated for a seat in a regional legislative assembly in central Russia. Elections there are Sunday. After her release, Griner returned to play for the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury, who host their final home game Friday against Las Vegas, then play their final game of the season Sunday afternoon at Las Vegas. The Mercury missed the playoffs this year, snapping the league's longest streak of 10 consecutive seasons. Russian authorities detained Griner at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport on Feb. 17, 2022, while she was traveling to Russia to play for club team UMMC Ekaterinburg. Customs officials found vape cartridges with oil derived from cannabis in her backpack. There was no public announcement of her arrest until March 5, 2022. Her plight unfolded at the same time Russia was invading Ukraine and further heightened tensions between Russia and the U.S. On July 7, 2022, Griner pleaded guilty to drug charges, saying she accidentally packed the vape cartridges. A Russian judge sentenced her to nine years in prison. Bout was serving a 25-year sentence at the United States Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois, after being convicted in 2011 on four felony counts, including conspiracy to kill Americans. Undercover agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration arrested Bout in a 2008 sting operation in Thailand. The U.S. agents had posed as Colombian rebels trying to buy millions of dollars' worth of weapons, which they said they would use to shoot down U.S. military aircraft. Asked about outrage in the U.S. over the crimes he was convicted of more than a decade ago versus what Griner was convicted of, Bout said: \"Well, think of this, that the same outrage was in Russia when I was sentenced to 25 years. Many people would say, 'For what? Just for talking? Are you serious?' \"There is not even a proper translation to Russian of the crime of conspiracy. We don't have such even the legal term, So, this is this same kind of outrage in Russia about my case and about many other cases.\" Bout maintained that he never intended to sell weapons. According to prosecutors, when undercover U.S. agents told him the weapons would be used against U.S. pilots, Bout responded, \"We have the same enemy.\" Bout said he identified in some ways with Griner and what she might have gone through at the time, saying, \"Of course, I feel, you know, bad or sorry for any person who's going to be used as a pawn, despite whether they committed something or not. \"Publicity is a, like, multiplying factor which can really kill you if you are not strong enough to handle it.\" He said people like himself or Griner sometimes \"pay a price\" because politicians try to \"play chess, on this big chessboard which they call geopolitics.\" Bout said he knew Griner had played for a Russian basketball team and won a Russian championship. He said that he followed developments in her case by watching coverage on CNN, ESPN and other U.S.-based networks while in prison and that he first heard that he might be involved in an exchange deal via news coverage. \"Look, I mean, in United States, I guess, only lazy would not, you know, cover her trial,\" he said. \"Every, you know, talking radio host, every news station, every TV channel on the news broadcast, so this was a big, big deal, I guess, you know, especially in jail.\" At the Abu Dhabi airport, Bout said, he was handed over to Russian authorities as Griner went with U.S. officials. Upon seeing Griner, Bout said, he was surprised to see her without her signature hair -- she cut it while in prison to avoid it freezing during the winter. He said that Griner was \"way taller than me\" and that they shook hands on the tarmac. Russian video of the moment shows the two approaching each other, but it cuts away and does not show them shaking hands as they turn for their respective departures. \"So, I said, you know, 'I wish you good luck,'\" he said, \"and, you know, and we both went to our, you know, planes.\" President Joe Biden authorized Bout's release. The exchange did not include Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine accused of spying and jailed in Russia since 2018. Bout said he agreed to speak with ESPN because he believes the U.S. and Russia \"have a common ground to at least have normal relation between our countries.\" In April, during Griner's first news conference since her detainment in Russia, the WNBA All-Star spoke of her resilience and gratitude and of how she used humor to manage during her experience. The two-time Olympic gold medalist who has played professionally in Russia and China said she would not play internationally again unless it's for the U.S. national team. She also spoke of the need to raise awareness of other U.S. detainees overseas.",

One simple ratio can guide your investment strategy in precious metals today. The post Gold vs. Silver: Which Precious Metal Should You Invest in Now? appeared first on InvestorPlace. More From InvestorPlace ChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires. Here\u2019s How to Get In. The Rich Use This Income Secret (NOT Dividends) Far More Than Regular Investors",
        "content": "I\u2019ve made the argument here recently that gold prices have a real chance of breaking out of their multi-year range on a potential credit event. But where does that mean for silver, which is often referred to as \u201cpoor man\u2019s gold?\u201d One thing you can look at is a simple price ratio of silver to gold. This ratio can provide crucial insights into the relative value of these two metals and help guide your investment strategy. The silver-to-gold ratio is a simple concept that measures the relative value of silver to gold. You can calculate it by dividing the current price of silver by the price of gold. In essence, this ratio tells you how many ounces of gold it would take to purchase one ounce of silver at current market prices. The silver-to-gold ratio is more than just a mathematical calculation; it\u2019s a tool that can inform your investment strategy. It also has some interesting implications on expectations for economic activity. Gold is more of a risk-off asset, whereas silver more a signal of industrial global demand and output. Should You Buy Silver or Gold? If we look at two ETFs as proxies, iShares Silver Trust (NYSEARCA: SLV ) for silver and SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA: GLD ) for gold, we can see that for the last decade, silver has underperformed gold. Silver prices have been in a tight range all year. When the ratio is high (above the historical average), it suggests that silver is overvalued relative to gold. This could be an indication that it\u2019s a good time to buy gold or sell silver. Conversely, when the ratio is low (below the historical average), it may indicate that silver is undervalued relative to gold, suggesting an opportune time to buy silver or sell gold. From a technical standpoint, it looks like the ratio is right at the midpoint, meaning it\u2019s unclear which outperforms which here. Regardless, the two are co-moving here and could continue to do so as demand for precious metal diversification increases. So, do you buy silver or gold? I think there\u2019s a case for both here, although I lean more towards gold. Keep in mind that investors often see precious metals like gold and silver as hedges against inflation. If inflation expectations are high, both metals may see price increases, but the impact on the silver-to-gold ratio would depend on the relative price changes. The Bottom Line The bottom line here is simple. The silver-to-gold ratio offers valuable insights for those investing in these precious metals. It can serve as a guide for allocating resources between gold and silver and help identify potential investment opportunities. Silver has underperformed gold for a decade, and gold could outpace silver pushing the ratio lower on a flight-to-safety sequence in the yellow metal. This however still likely means silver does well, although it would underperform on a relative basis. I think, broadly speaking, diversifying in precious metals makes sense given where we are in the cycle, and some big movements could be on the horizon.

        "content": "When a Soviet submarine carrying nuclear warheads sunk into the north Pacific in 1968, the CIA took on a hugely ambitious project to recover it. To keep it all a secret, the agency enlisted the help of Howard Hughes , who provided the agency cover, the guise being that the deep ocean activity was part of his company\u2019s mining exploration. The six-year CIA project \u2014 called Project Azorian \u2014 is one of the episodes of the new Netflix series Spy Ops , which looks at some of the most notorious spy operations in history. Related Stories Breaking News Arnon Milchan Receives Legend Of Cinema Award From Warren Beatty - CinemaCon Acquisitions Fox & New Regency Setting Fall Release For Warren Beatty's Howard Hughes Movie The agency is collaborating with the producer of the series, Big Media, often shedding new light on Cold War-era and more recent operations that involve Argo -like risks and secrecy, while certain details still remain classified. Other episodes delve into the intrigue surrounding the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II in 1981, and another in 2001 to sneak a CIA team into Afghanistan in the aftermath of 9/11. Following other shows like Spycraft and Terrorism Close Calls , which also have streamed on Netflix and other outlets, Big Media\u2019s Spy Ops , co-produced with Thematics Productions and debuting on Friday, comes at a time with growing distrust of the government overall. Jon Loew , Big Media\u2019s co-founder and chairman, who serves as executive producer of Spy Ops, said, \u201cWe are living in a time when it\u2019s difficult to discern fact from fiction, and people are given lots of stories, lots of things to think about our spy agencies, about our government, about our world today,. And I think it is really important to highlight the successful missions of the CIA and other organizations who are working to protect us, and do it in an objective documentary format like ours.\u201d The Project Azorian episode looks at a mission that left people \u201cin shock and disbelief that something this audacious and advanced could be done all while working below the radar and undercover and having it not be exposed until after the initial mission.\u201d After the Soviet sub disappeared, the U.S. found the submarine three miles below the ocean surface about 1,800 miles northwest of Hawaii, although the exact details of how it was discovered remain classified. The basic idea of the operation was to use a large mechanical claw to grab the hull of the sub and lift it via a hydraulic system. It entailed building a ship for the mission, the Hughes Glomar Explorer, with the cover that it was part of the billionaire\u2019s deep sea mining research for manganese nodules. The CIA describes the project to retrieve the submarine this way: \u201cImagine standing atop the Empire State Building with an 8-foot-wide grappling hook on a 1-inch-diameter steel rope. Your task is to lower the hook to the street below, snag a compact car full of gold, and lift the car back to the top of the building. On top of that, the job has to be done without anyone noticing.\u201d The Soviets did not know the location of the sub and, as is shown in the episode, their government officials actually disbelieved the idea that the U.S. would undertake such an expensive and uncertain effort to retrieve it. Robert Wallace, who served 33 years as an operations officer and senior executive at the CIA, said, \u201cEvery intelligence service in the world has as one of its standing requirements to understand as deeply as possible the military capabilities of other countries. The existence of submarines, and particularly nuclear submarines, on both sides and for all parties becomes really a priority requirement.\u201d Wallace, who appears in the series, said that the nuclear capability of the missiles, and the technical details related to their maintenance and operation, \u201cwould have been just golden for their American government to have its hands on.\u201d Spy Ops relied on archival footage, including some of the explorer at sea, as well as recreations and special effects, to depict the operation. Loew said it was a process of \u201ctelling a story where there are elements that are intentionally missing because they\u2019re still classified. So you are taking this fragmented story with bits and pieces of footage, getting most of the story or some of the story by the people [involved], and then having to fill in the blanks and string it along and make it seem like you haven\u2019t missed any of it.\u201d Among those who were assigned to Project Azorian was Sherman Wetmore, who worked for the offshore drilling company Global Marine, tasked with designing, building and operating the explorer. He was put in charge of a group of engineers responsible for the operations of the heavy lift system, the docking system and the well system. The capture vehicle was lowered from the explorer by adding, one at a time, 60-foot sections of steel pipe, until it reached the wreckage. Then the jaws of the capture vehicle would essentially grab the wreckage of the submarine and painstakingly lift it back into the hull of the Glomar. \u201cIt was such a complex system,\u201d Wetmore said. \u201cObviously, a single thread in the whole system was the pipe. If the pipe breaks, it\u2019s game over. And there was no back up and no way to retrieve and finish the problem.\u201d He added, \u201cFrom the very start, we were worried from a design standpoint about the weather, and the soil became unknowns. We didn\u2019t know how much steel was buried underneath the submarine. Therefore, how do we grab a broken piece of iron, that is broken in several different places? That was a guess.\u201d Thousands were involved in the program, but great steps were taken to maintain sercrecy. John Cardwell, who joined the CIA in 1966, became an expert in digital image enhancement, and was critical to providing guidance on what would be optimal conditions for images capturing the submarine. He was assigned to a unit in the Pentagon, where he worked on Azorian and a number of underwater reconnaissance programs. Cardwell noted that there was so much concern of the project being exposed that John Parangosky, leader on the Glomar program for the CIA, never even visited the ship, \u201cjust to ensure that no one of note tainted the mission or the security.\u201d \u201cIt was that kind of intensity of maintaining the cover and maintaining a sense of anonymity as to what you are doing and where you are going,\u201d Cardwell said. After years of development and construction, the recovery operation took place in 1974. The capture vehicle retrieved the submarine section, but as it was lifted and about halfway up to the ship, about 2/3 broke apart, and sank back to the floor. The Glomar team did retrieve what remained of the vessel. Much of what was recovered remains classified, with lots of reports through the years on what was retrieved, including a book and NPR report that two nuclear-tipped torpedoes were found. A suspected cause of the break has been that a few of the claw\u2019s \u201cgrabber\u201d arms broke. In the immediate aftermath, Wetmore said, \u201cof course the first thing is, \u2018why did that happen?\u2019 and [people] start pointing fingers and that wasn\u2019t productive. We made sure that at least if we had something, we would get it all the way up to prove the engineering worked.\u201d The bodies of six members of the crew were recovered, and they were given a formal military burial at sea. That ceremony was filmed, and the footage was eventually presented to Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 1992. Plans were afoot for another recovery effort, but the project was in early 1975 exposed when the Los Angeles Times published a report on it. In a strange twist to the story, the previous year there had been a break in at Hughes offices in Los Angeles, with burglars stealing secret documents that tied the billionaire and his company to the operation. Reporters began to pick up on the investigation of the break in and other rumors, but then-CIA director William Colby had for a time gotten some outlets to withhold the story from publication. Cardwell said, \u201cWhen the first report came out in the L.A. Times, there were a lot of errors in it, and at the time we thought we might be able to ride the storm because we were well underway to rebuilding a rebuilt capture vehicle under the Matador program to go back and pick up the piece that was dropped. We were like 95% confident that that operation would have been completely successful. \u2026We knew exactly what we were going after and how much it weighed.\u201d He said when legendary D.C. journalist Jack Anderson weighed in with a more accurate story and the Soviets then put a ship on the site, \u201cthat was pretty much the death knell of the whole thing as far as I was concerned.\u201d Wetmore said, \u201cEven if we had tried [again], I think the Russians would have been out there somewhere. They were there watching everything we were doing, the whole time we were doing it. I think that was a testament to, one the cover story and two, the audacity.\u201d The total mission cost $300 million to $400 million, or about $2 billion today. That\u2019s a hefty price tag, but those involved still believe it was worth it. The CIA Museum in Langley, VA features a section on Project Azorian, including a recently declassified model of the Soviet sub wreckage that was used in the operation\u2019s planning, as well as manganese remnants and a poster-sized copy of the Los Angeles Times story. Cardwell and Wetmore, who also appear in the episode, joined Wallace on a tour this week. The exhibit emphasizes how the agency was worked with private industry to carry out missions. Wetmore noted that the American Society of Mechanical Engineers recognized the mission as a \u201clandmark mechanical engineering achievement.\u201d \u201cIt was not a boondoggle. It was possible and it worked,\u201d he said. Wetmore said, \u201cIt was explained to me that intelligence and estimating and guessing and analyzing is really a house of cards, and every once in a while you need a ground truth. And this would be one hell of a ground truth. I think we learned stuff just from the metallurgy in the hull.\u201d Cardwell said, \u201cA lot of people now will say that almost any money spent on something that is risky is a waste of money. I disagree with that. We need organizations such as the CIA and the NSA and the DIA and so forth, to really reach out and go beyond what is conventional wisdom and try to solve important intelligence problems.\u201d As the CIA Museum notes, the project did lead to what has become an agency standard response. After the project was exposed, Rolling Stone filed a Freedom of Information Act request for details. The agency then came up with the phrase, \u201cwe can neither confirm nor deny,\u201d known as the Glomar response. \u201cSecrets in an open society are really tricky,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cI like to think of them as radioactive, and I think of them as radioactive in the sense that there are some radioactive elements that decay in a few seconds, and there are some radioactive elements that don\u2019t decay for decades. And I think intelligence secrets are a bit analogous to that. Some of our secrets we want to maintain forever. Many of our secrets they decay fairly quickly. And I think this story, Azorian, is one that merits being told.\u201d",

        "description": "China\u2019s slide into deflation is an ominous sign for Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia.",
        "content": "Of all the challenges newish Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda thought he\u2019d encounter in 2023, Chinese deflation wasn\u2019t among them. Since April, Ueda has struggled to manage widespread expectations that the BOJ would exit 23 years of quantitative easing. Those forecasts, of course, were partly based on the near certainty that China\u2019s post-Covid-19 reopening would lead to explosive Asian growth and upward pressure on inflation. The opposite happened. Cratering mainland property markets undermined growth and demand. Now, as investors buzz about \u201cJapanification\u201d in Asia\u2019s biggest economy, officials in Tokyo are doing an about-face of their own. China\u2019s slide into deflation is changing the calculus in Tokyo. The 8.8% drop in Chinese exports in August year on year is an ominous sign for Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia. The fourth consecutive month of sliding overseas sales also means the 7.3% decline in imports is no aberration. Less mainland demand for Japanese goods will dull the benefits of a weak yen. The yen\u2019s 12.3% drop so far this year should have Japanese gross domestic product jumping off the charts. Not so, as China slows, European demand underwhelms and U.S. growth moderates. Instead, China\u2019s trajectory is adding to the reasons why Japan Inc. isn\u2019t fattening paychecks as hoped. As a senior Japanese official told Reuters this week: \u201cWhat's happening in China is worrying and could deal a huge blow to Japan's economy.\u201d Another added: \u201cA downturn in China may diminish the chance of Japan achieving sustained wage growth.\u201d All this leaves Ueda\u2019s team on QE autopilot, at best, and mulling additional easing moves, at worst. Ueda suggested as much late last month, saying China data are coming in \u201con the weak side.\u201d What\u2019s more, Ueda said, \u201cthe underlying problem appears to be the adjustment in the property sector and its spillover to the rest of the economy.\u201d That spillover is clouding China\u2019s outlook at this very moment. Thankfully, Country Garden, China\u2019s biggest private developer, this week narrowly avoided default. But the magnitude of risks facing a sector that can generate as much as 30% of GDP continues to spook global investors. Its stumble echoes that of China Evergrande Group in 2021. Evergrande\u2019s default and subsequent bankruptcy filing spotlighted cracks in China\u2019s financial system. More recent troubles at Zhongzhi Enterprise Group fanned concerns about a liquidity crisis in China\u2019s giant shadow banking sector. All this is generating more than a whiff of paranoia at BOJ headquarters. In the months leading up to April, Ueda\u2019s predecessor Haruhiko Kuroda punted on beginning the exit from QE. Kuroda\u2019s bet was that as China\u2019s post-COVID boom unfolded, it would give Ueda political cover to \u201ctaper\u201d on the way to an actual rate hike or two. Ueda has effectively taken normalizing monetary policy off the table. This is causing the largest Japan-U.S. rate gap since the early 2000s. The current nearly 5 percentage-point difference is well beyond that of 2007, the last time the \u201cyen-carry trade\u201d was the rage in global markets. With rates at or below zero since 1999, Japan became the top creditor nation. It became routine practice for investors to borrow cheaply in yen and carry those funds over to higher yielding assets from Argentina to South Africa to India to New Zealand. The leverage these trades facilitate explains why sudden yen moves can cause panic around the globe . And, in times like this, complicate the BOJ\u2019s policy options. In late December, for example, the BOJ announced the slighter of tweaks to relieve some tension between yen-dollar rates. Yet the move to let 10-year yields rise as high as 0.5% trashed global markets. The BOJ spent the last 10 days of 2023 doing unscheduled and large purchases of Japanese debt to tame markets. And to communicate that QE remains the law of the land. Since arriving on the job 152 days ago, Ueda has been ultra careful not to slam markets. Perhaps too careful, considering that Japan is experiencing its highest inflation in decades. This week, the retail price of gold hit a record high in Japan as households seek to hedge risks. Add China\u2019s slowdown to the mix and Japan faces the specter of \u201cstagflation,\u201d where growth slides as prices rise. Talk about an unenviable turn of events for the Ueda-led BOJ. Throttle back too fast on stimulus as Chinese demand weakens, and the BOJ could be blamed for tipping Japan into recession. Act too slowly to cap inflation expectations and price increases may become permanent. The answer, of course, is for Prime Minister Fumio Kishida\u2019s team to attack inflation from the supply side. Moves to increase efficiency in a notoriously rigid economy could temper price increases. Kishida\u2019s diplomats could seek free-trade deals overseas to slash costs of imported energy, food and other vital commodities. Yet the benefits from such steps by governments tend to take time. This leaves Ueda with one of the worst jobs in global central banking as China\u2019s 2023 goes awry. And increasingly, Japan\u2019s too.",

        "description": "Gallium has multiple advantages but processing it has been difficult. This might be about to change after new discovery.",
        "content": "Researchers at the Zhejiang University in China have devised a new method that allows for easier and cost-effective production of gallium oxide, an alternative to silicon for semiconductors, . The discovery assumes importance amidst the ban on gallium export to China. Silicon may be a significant component powering semiconductor-based applications. Still, the industry has evolved to use compounds such as and indium phosphide in production processes over the years. Gallium oxide is the newest entrant in the arena. What is gallium oxide? Gallium oxide is a fourth-generation ultra-wide band gap semiconductor that can withstand a strong electric field and consumes little power. A band gap is the amount of energy needed to free electrons inside a semiconductor material, and an ultra-wide band gap allows the material to be used for high-voltage applications. Among other ultra-wide band gap materials, such as gallium nitride and silicon carbide, gallium oxide has many advantages. However, its production is much more challenging. Gallium oxide is the only material that can form single crystals at atmospheric pressure after solidification from a melt. This can drastically reduce fabrication costs, but the process needs large amounts of iridium to make a crucible for the melt. A four-inch crucible requires about 11 pounds (five kg) of iridium; since the price of iridium is three times that of gold, this increases production costs. It also raises concerns about intellectual property in China since Japan and the US have used the method. Chinese innovation amidst US ban Last year, researchers at the State Key Laboratory of Silicon Materials at Zhejiang University made two-inch gallium oxide wafers. This year, they have improved their approach and made four-inch wafers. Their improved approach involved a casting method that uses up to 80 percent less iridium. This will help reduce production costs and make the process shorter and more manageable for mass production. The team has spun off a company that holds the patents for these improved methods and is currently working on using a temperature gradient to increase the size of the crystals produced. Due to their low energy consumption, gallium oxide semiconductors are ideal for use in communications, aerospace, radar, and electrified transportation like cars and trains. Last year, the US Commerce Department imposed an export ban on gallium oxide to China, citing concerns about national security since they can also be used for military purposes. The ban aimed to prevent China from gaining experience in next-generation semiconductors, where gallium oxide alone is expected to be a $1.5 billion opportunity by the end of the decade. Not only has China overcome the aims of the ban but, in a tit-for-tat response, imposed a ban on the export of gallium and germanium from August 1 this year. The US-China tensions have also resulted in the Western nations imposing bans on chips from China. Once again aimed at stifling innovations, the move had an unintended effect when Huawei unveiled its newest Mate 60 Pro phone with an . The US imposition seems to have no impact on the Chinese juggernaut. ex",

        "description": "Gotham Knights has been rated for Nintendo Switch.",
        "content": "Gotham Knights may be coming to Nintendo Switch . Batman is one of the most iconic superheroes of all-time. The character has been popular for over 80 years thanks to his incredible comics, TV shows (both live action and animated), films, and of course, games. Batman has endured some painful installments in all of those mediums as well, but generally, it's a character that people keep going back to and enjoying. Batman has also spawned other characters that have spun-off into their own solo adventures such as Joker, Robin, and many others. After the incredible success of the Batman Arkham series, WB decided to try and see if Batman's superhero family could successfully be spun off into their own game. With that, the co-op game Gotham Knights was born. Unfortunately, the game was met with a mixed reception and didn't seem to sell terribly well. Many assumed that would mean the game would probably be swept under the rug, but it seems like that's not the case. Gotham Knights appears to be making a return soon via the Nintendo Switch. Both the ESRB and a Singapore ratings board have rated Gotham Knights for Nintendo Switch. These are new ratings and come from two different sources, which suggests it's real. It's also worth noting that cloud-based games don't get rated for Nintendo Switch, so this would likely be native to the console. You can view the rating description via the ESRB below. Gotham Knights has been rated for Nintendo Switch in Singapore. pic.twitter.com/TV9RwzUhp1 \u2014 Andrew Marmo (@the_marmolade) September 9, 2023 \"This is an action role-playing game in which players control one of four Batman Family members through missions around Gotham City. Players explore open-world environments while investigating crime scenes and fighting criminals/villains. Players mostly engage in melee-style combat using punches, kicks, and takedowns to defeat enemies. Combat is highlighted by impact sounds, cries of pain, occasional gunfire, and explosions. Stealth attacks and takedowns result in brief cutscenes: characters slamming enemies' heads into floors/walls; kicks/knees to the head; close-range gunshots to enemies' torsos. Blood stains are sometimes depicted on wounded characters' faces and/or clothing and splattered around crime scenes; some bodies can be examined for autopsy during investigations. The game contains several alcohol references (e.g., wine, beer, whiskey, drunkenness), and one scene depicts a villain drinking whiskey. Some characters can be seen smoking in various areas of Gotham City. The words \"sh*t\" and \"a*shole\" appear in the game.\" It's also worth noting that games are typically rated toward the end of their development. If this rating is appearing now, it signifies that this could be released very soon, possibly in time for the game's one year anniversary in October. There have been rumblings of a new Nintendo Direct lately, so this could be something that gets announced there. The rumored release is fairly interesting as the game was only released on Xbox Series X |S, PS5, and PC before and the Nintendo Switch is more in-line with last-gen hardware.

        "content": "From every perspective, John le Carr\u00e9 lived a highly enviable life, a sense confirmed over and over again in The Pigeon Tunnel , Errol Morris \u2019 elaborate, super-smart sizing up of one of the most successful writers of the past century. The author gained fame as a novelist fine-tuned to examine the many layers of intrigue, rivalry, deception, ruthlessness and intelligence employed in the epic battle between East and West in the second half of the 20th century, one that, rather remarkably, never exploded into World War III. A hefty miniseries would be required to illuminate and express all the knowledge and expertise brought to bear in le Carr\u00e9\u2019s voluminous output (he wrote 31 books and much else). The similarly prodigious Morris patiently waited until the author, whose real name was David Cornwall, was ready to sit down and talk; it was, unsurprisingly, the author\u2019s final interview, as he died shortly thereafter, in December 2009. The result overflows with fascinating material, even as you get the sense that what we\u2019re hearing and seeing represents the mere tip of a self-protective iceberg. Such was the life of spies and the man who so acutely wrote about what he knew of them. Related Stories Breaking News Errol Morris's Henry Kissinger Project? Not Gonna Happen. Director Says Foreign Policy Giant \"Got Cold Feet\" - Telluride Breaking News Documentary On Spy Novelist John Le Carr\u00e9, AKA David Cornwell, Coming From Apple TV+, The Ink Factory And Oscar Winner Errol Morris The first thing you notice about the film is how elaborate it is \u2014 word is that it cost $10 million to make, a great deal for a documentary. Morris loads it with information and insights, as well as abundant narration, music and interstitial shots, including the titular pigeons being released and shot at by sportsmen. But there is one aspect that is even more evident: In his on-camera narration and storytelling, le Carr\u00e9 speaks with abundant authority, clarity and specificity, with every word ready to be spoken and never an \u201cum,\u201d hesitation, pause, redundancy, self-correction or momentary uncertainty. His delivery could not be more confident and clear, his memory impeccable, even though he was nearly 90 when he died in 2020. The major factor in his life, at least the first part of it, was his mother\u2019s abandonment of the family, when the lad was 5 years old, to run off with another man; he only ever met his mum again decades later. His education sent him hither and yon, without much parental intimacy; he learned multiple languages, taught, moved into the intelligence corps (a story unto itself) and had two novels published before breaking through in 1963 with the international bestseller The Spy Who Came in from the Cold . Only then did he leave his government job to become a full-time writer. Morris crams his work with insightful talk not only from the horse\u2019s mouth but numerous observers and former colleagues; as he insists, \u201cA writer\u2019s task is to steal from life.\u201d The author sits with his interlocutor in a simple elegant room and it\u2019s a rare occasion to see the often tricky Morris treating his subject as a full equal, as well he might. Both of them are listeners highly attuned to what is being said to them, and Morris has, not infrequently, shrewdly set up his subjects in order to drop bombs on them in the hope of triggering some strong reaction, which sometimes has opened a door on the truth. There\u2019s no need for such subterfuge with le Carr\u00e9, not that Morris would get away with any tidbits of information that the subject might try to trick the cagy old spy into revealing. Thus a very agreeable balance is achieved, one which sees both men live up to their reputations as very smart fellows who could never be pressured into spilling any beans. There is much to revel in here, a quite special occasion on which to enjoy two very smart and experienced men with many interesting things to say about many things. No spy will ever willingly reveal everything, but what we get here is more than enough for one evening.

(Sep)NOTE: Previews are listed in day orderNORWEGIAN CPI (MON): The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced.UK UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES (TUE): Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end.UK GDP ESTIMATE (WED): A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought.US CPI (WED): Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern.ECB ANNOUNCEMENT (THU): 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%.AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYMENT (THU): participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms.SWEDISH CPIF (THU): July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak.US RETAIL SALES (THU): Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July. While the data set will offer a glimpse on the health of the consumer amid concerns that the economy may slow significantly in the months ahead, traders will also be watching the University of Michigan's prelim survey release due Friday, where the rise in energy prices is likely to have weighed on sentiment.CHINESE ACTIVITY DATA (FRI): Retail sales Y/Y in August are expected to rise by 2.8% (prev. 2.5%), whilst there is currently no consensus for Industrial Production metrics. The data will be closely watched to diagnose the health of the world\u2019s second-larger economy and to gauge the drip-feed of stimulus seen over recent weeks. Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d.This article originally appeared on Newsquawk This article was written by Newsquawk Analysis at www.forexlive.com.",

        "content": "In the world of Agatha Christie adaptations, there\u2019s always a delicate balance to strike between remaining faithful to the source and modernizing the narrative for contemporary audiences. A Haunting in Venice is Kenneth Branagh \u2019s third venture in this territory and may have finally found his rhythm with these films. In addition to Branagh, the film stars Tina Fey, Michelle Yeoh , Kelly Reilly, Jamie Dornan, Camille Cottin, and others. In Venice 1947, Hercule Periot (Branaugh) is retired and no longer a detective, but Adriane (Fey), a mystery novel writer looking for her next hit story, convinces him to accompany her to a seance to find out if the medium chosen for the event is a liar. What they find is that this home is the location of a tragedy. The current owner of the Palazzo, Rowena (Reilly), an opera singer, has contacted a medium Ms Reynolds (Yeoh) to connect with a relative who died there. Related Stories Labor 'Oppenheimer' Cast Leaves London Premiere Before Screening As SAG-AFTRA's Official Strike Call Looms Breaking News 'Murder Is Easy': David Jonsson, Morfydd Clark & Penelope Wilton Among Cast Of Agatha Christie Adaptation For BBC & BritBox International There is tension in the air, as weird things begin to happen like falling chimneys, and doors blowing open, but it isn\u2019t enough to convince everyone that there are ghosts there. Ms. Reynolds makes contact with other spirits in the home. She does make contact with someone who was murdered in the house but before anyone can find out what happened to her, the medium awakes from the trance. Now that this has gone from the supernatural to a murder mystery, Periot\u2019s interest is peaked as he aims to get to the answers Ms. Reynold couldn\u2019t. From the start, the mystery unfolds at a steady pace. While there\u2019s a heightened sense of anticipation, the plot is somewhat predictable. This, however, does not take away from the experience but plot events aren\u2019t as exciting as the film wants them to be. However, in terms of tone, A Haunting in Venice finds a maturity that its predecessors perhaps lacked. There\u2019s a balanced seriousness that anchors the narrative with a subtle blend of elements that are well executed. One feature of Branagh\u2019s direction in this installment is his peculiar choice of framing characters off-center. This unusual style could be interpreted in many ways: perhaps as a reflection of the misaligned motives of the characters or simply a different approach to classic storytelling. The cast, which includes the likes of Michelle Yeoh, Tina Fey, Jamie Dornan, Kelly Reilly, and Camille Cotton, all deliver measured performances that steer clear of the theatricality that can sometimes plague mystery adaptations. It\u2019s a cast with real chemistry that blends well together. The film benefits from its scaled-down approach. Previous adaptations, with their star-studded casts and expansive settings, felt vast\u2014perhaps too vast for the intimate mysteries Christie writes. In the film, here\u2019s a welcome return to a more confined space. Fewer characters allow for a deeper dive into each persona. As this tale is one of Christie\u2019s lesser-known works, adapting it was a clever choice, filling in the gaps and nuances that the book might have left ambiguous. There is a consistent conundrum regarding the continuation of these adaptations, given their minor success. With enormous budgets and A-list casts in the past, it was time to see A Haunting in Venice take a step back. This film appears to be more in line with Christie\u2019s intent. Her narratives often thrived in confinement, sometimes to the point of being claustrophobic. Venice, with its labyrinthine canals and narrow alleyways, serves as the perfect backdrop for such a tale. This smaller scope and concise storytelling make this film the standout in Branagh\u2019s Christie trilogy. A Haunting in Venice seems to have captured the essence of what makes Agatha Christie\u2019s works timeless. By scaling down and focusing on the smaller elements of both the plot and the characters, Branagh and his team have delivered a film that is both an homage to Christie and a film that far exceeds the first two.

The conference is under contract to produce approximately 120 football and men\u2019s basketball games for ESPN and Fox and another 850 live events for the Pac-12 Networks\u2019 distribution partners during the 2023-24 sports season. The technology used to broadcast events is first rate, but the conference needs actual humans to handle the operations and production. And many of those humans are job hunting as the Pac-12\u2019s final season of competition unfolds. Internally, conference executives are crafting two plans to navigate the next nine months, according to a source with knowledge of the situation: \u2014 A scope-of-services plan to determine which services should be continued as normal, downsized or eliminated. \u2014 An employee retention-and-severance plan to maintain the staffing necessary to support the athletes and produce the events that generate the media cash. (There are roughly 50 employees on the conference side and another 150 who work for the Pac-12 Networks.) An independent, outside firm has been retained to provide advice on the retention piece, both plans require approval from the Pac-12\u2019s board of directors. Which brings us to the thunderous development Friday: Washington State and Oregon State to determine the makeup of the board and to prevent the outbound schools from casting votes until the board\u2019s composition is established. WSU and OSU believe the 10 departing presidents and chancellors have relinquished their voting rights and decision-making authority. That authority includes the power of the purse. Included in that power of the purse? You guessed it: the employee retention plan and the scope-of-services plans. The tipping point for legal action came late last month, when Kliavkoff, whose position is not included in the retention plan, attempted to schedule a board meeting for the middle of September. The agenda was designed to include discussion of \u201cmatters related to the departing members, proposed amendments to the Bylaws, a proposed conflicts-of-interest plan for Pac-12 members, and an employee compensation and retention plan for the Commissioner and other employees of the Pac-12,\u201d according to the legal filings in Whitman County (Wash.) Superior Court. But WSU president Kirk Schulz, chair of the CEO Group, declined to convene the full board because he believes the Cougars and Beavers the board. When Kliavkoff , the Cougars and Beavers took the conference to court to prevent the outbound members from voting on matters of governance. After all, the 10 departing presidents could form a bloc that dictates the future of the conference and the allocation of tens of millions of dollars in assets. The only items scheduled for votes at the board meeting were the retention-and-severance plan and the scope-of-services plan, according to the source, who added: \u201cThere was no intent to call a vote on governance.\u201d Did Schulz believe that? In a court declaration, which was obtained by the Hotline, he said the following: That\u2019s the vote the Cougars and Beavers are trying to avoid \u2014 the \u201cgo-forward governance\u201d vote that could feature a bloc of departing schools and bring \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to WSU and OSU, in Schulz\u2019s view. Additionally, the legal action could have been intended to avoid establishing a precedent. If the full board votes on an employee retention plan, that seemingly would set the course for the full board to vote on everything, including the issues that matter most to WSU and OSU: the governance of the conference and distribution of assets. If the temporary restraining order is approved \u2014 a hearing is scheduled for Monday in Whitman County \u2014 then it could be weeks before the board, in any form, is able to cast a vote. Somehow, some way, the conference must find a compromise that allows for approval of the scope-of-services and employee retention-and-severance plans. The legal action might bring the board\u2019s business to a halt, but it won\u2019t stop essential staffers from looking for work.",

        "content": "September will be a momentous month, either in the right or wrong direction. Congress will soon take up votes on repealing outdated authorizations for use of military force, or AUMFs, which provide statutory authority for military operations in the Middle East. It\u2019s fitting that these AUMFs are up for repeal as we approach and reflect on the anniversary of Sept. 11, a catalyst event that propelled the United States to war in the greater Middle East more than 20 years ago. Over the past two decades, U.S. involvement in conflicts including Iraq and Afghanistan have rung up an unimaginably high toll. The cost of the Global War on Terror has reached over just for the war operations themselves. These numbers just skim the surface. It\u2019s not simply the direct cost of executing war. It\u2019s the cost affecting the fabric of our communities for generations after decades of war. The Department of Veterans Affairs has seen a new wave of post-9/11 veterans with needs unique to their wars. The VA budget has increased since 2000 to . That is $25 billion from just the previous year. The cost of care for post-9/11 veterans is estimated to soar up to an astonishing by 2050, even as the overall number of veterans the VA serves is declining. of post-9/11 veterans have some form of disability rating with the VA so far and receive dollars and/or services for their injuries. PTSD and traumatic brain injuries are the defining injuries of these wars, leading to stunningly high , and . Estimates suggest more GWOT veterans have died of suicide than died in combat. The physical injuries come with their own set of challenges, including the need for treatment aids like prosthetics, service animals and adaptive homes. All the while, veterans exposed to toxins and burn pits on their deployments are coping with cancers and illnesses they\u2019d never have imagined they\u2019d be plagued with. None of the above makes the transition out of service any easier. Like Americans always do, we\u2019ve risen to the challenge to care for veterans and meet their needs. Veterans organizations all over the country do their best to ensure veterans have what they need to thrive in post-service life. But that noble work copes with the symptoms of congressional malaise \u2014 the legislature\u2019s persistent unwillingness to make tough, responsible decisions about military engagement. as an alternative to declaring war. While the intention may be good, overly broad poorly written AUMFs can evolve into instruments that perpetuate the cycle of conflict if not subject to proper oversight. The AUMFs up for repeal are a prime example. The 1957, 1991 and 2002 AUMFs each authorized some form of engagement in the Middle East \u2014 combatting communism through security assistance and authorizing operations in the first and second Iraq Wars, respectively. None of these AUMFs are the sole authority for any ongoing operations, yet they remain a potentially abusable back door to conflict without a congressional vote. Multiple presidents and military leaders have leaned on open AUMFs to justify actions outside the original intention of the authorizations. These operations can have dire consequences such as the devastating attack on in Niger in 2017. Keeping AUMFs on the books just leaves the door open for more long-term deployments to all reaches of the globe to fight enemies that don\u2019t threaten core national interests. Unfortunately, Congress just lets this happen. After all, the AUMFs were voted on at some point, right? Why take on the hard work and burden of scrutinizing whether existing AUMFs are still appropriate or whether troops to be sent to war? The blunt answer is because millions still bear the hidden costs of war and thousands of men and women have died in defense of the Constitution that requires it. I served in the Army and Navy for 22 years. I saw friends die on the battlefield and witnessed their struggles when they came home. I have dealt with my own health problems and read too many stories and accounts of veterans who take their own lives daily. Those of us who served are more than just numbers and statistics. We are the tip of the spear who live the consequences of our leaders\u2019 decisions. The least Congress can do is honor our oath to the Constitution by debating and voting on matters of war. If a situation arises that requires military action, Congress can address it at that point, not just rely on blank check authorization to get them out of doing their job. I urge members of Congress to reclaim their constitutional responsibility and shut the open doors that are the 1957, 1991 and 2002 AUMFs through repeal.",

        "description": "President Biden and his allies have outlined plans to create a rail and shipping corridor linking India with the Middle East and ultimately Europe.",
        "content": "President Biden and his allies on Saturday announced plans to build a rail and shipping corridor linking India with the Middle East and Europe, an ambitious project aimed at fostering economic growth and political cooperation . \u201cThis is a big deal,\u201d said Biden. \u201cThis is a really big deal.\u201d The corridor , outlined at the annual Group of 20 summit of the world\u2019s top economies, would help boost trade, deliver energy resources and improve digital connectivity. It would include India, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Israel and the European Union, said Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s national security advisor. Sullivan said the network reflected Biden\u2019s vision for \u201cfar-reaching investments\u201d that come from \u201ceffective American leadership\u201d and a willingness to embrace other nations as partners. He said the enhanced infrastructure would boost economic growth, help bring countries in the Middle East together and establish that region as a hub for economic activity instead of as a \u201csource of challenge, conflict or crisis\u201d as it has been in recent history. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi , European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other leaders from around the world participated in the announcement. \u201cEnhancing connectivity with all regions has been a key priority for India,\u201d said Modi, speaking through an interpreter. \u201cWe believe that connectivity is a means to not only increase mutual trade between different countries but also increase mutual trust.\u201d The rail and shipping corridor would help physically tie together a vast stretch of the globe, improving digital connectivity and enabling more trade among countries, including with energy products such as hydrogen. Although White House officials did not set a timeline for its completion, the corridor would provide a physical and ideological alternative to China\u2019s own nation-spanning infrastructure program. The White House gave no details on the project\u2019s cost or financing, though Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman mentioned a figure of $20 billion during the announcement. It was unclear whether that sum applied solely to the Saudi commitment. After the announcement, Biden greeted the crown prince with a hearty handshake , a friendlier exchange than when they last met, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, just over a year ago. At that time, Biden, who had harshly criticized Prince Mohammed over the kingdom\u2019s human rights record, awkwardly greeted him with a fist bump, a moment roundly criticized by rights activists. Von der Leyen described the project as a \u201cgreen and digital bridge across continents and civilizations.\u201d She added that it includes cables to transmit electricity and data. She also announced a \u201cTrans-African Corridor\u201d connecting the Angolan port of Lobito with landlocked areas of the continent: the Kananga province in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the copper-mining regions of Zambia. Speaking of the African project, Biden called it a \u201cgame-changing regional investment\u201d and said \u201cboth of these are huge, huge steps forward.\u201d Amos Hochstein, Biden\u2019s coordinator for global infrastructure and energy security, laid out a rough timeline for the project over the next year. In the next 60 days, working groups will put together a fuller plan and set timelines. The first phase will involve identifying the areas that need investment and where physical infrastructure can be connected between countries. Hochstein said the plans can be put into place over the next year so that the project can move onto setting up finances and construction. Sullivan said the project started coming together after Biden visited Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in July 2022, where he emphasized a need for greater regional economic integration. In January, the White House started having conversations with regional partners about the concept. By spring, maps and written assessments of existing rail infrastructure in the Middle East were being drafted. Sullivan, and senior White House aides Hochstein and Brett McGurk, traveled to Saudi Arabia in May to meet with their Indian, Saudi and UAE counterparts. All sides have worked since then to finalize details of the agreement announced Saturday. The parties also brought Israel and Jordan into the project. Saudi Arabia and Israel do not have diplomatic relations, though the White House has been pushing them toward normalizing relations. Sullivan said the transportation project is not seen as a \u201cprecursor\u201d to a potential normalization deal but he characterized Israel\u2019s inclusion as \u201csignificant.\u201d \u201cThe participants in this effort are focused on practical outcomes that deliver for their people,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cAnd a corridor of this kind by dint of geography works best having Israel in as opposed to out and the countries participating prioritized that.\u201d Biden participated in both G20 sessions on Saturday. He highlighted plans to push for more investments to address climate change, such as his own domestic incentives to encourage the use of renewable energy. He also argued that Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is hurting many other nations, which have had to cope with greater food and energy costs as well as higher interest rate costs on their debt. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been a regular presence at international summits, including last year\u2019s G20 in Indonesia, since Russia invaded his country more than 18 months ago, was not invited by Modi\u2019s government to this year\u2019s gathering. Zelensky has used the high-profile gatherings to argue for continued economic and military support for his country. India is one of the most prominent U.S. allies that has largely stayed on the sidelines of the war, and has even dramatically increased its purchases of Russian oil. Jon Finer, the White House principal deputy national security advisor, said the administration pushed for Zelensky\u2019s inclusion at the summit. \u201cUltimately, it is not our decision,\u201d Finer said. \u201cBut you can expect that the United States and our other partners who are working with Ukraine so closely ... We\u2019ll make that case quite forcefully in the context of these conversations.\u201d The summit communique, a joint statement agreed to by all participants, addressed the war, among other issues. It included language underlining the principle that states cannot use force to change borders, disavowed the use of nuclear weapons and called for a just peace based on the principles of the U.N. Charter. The communique also underscored that attacks on civilian infrastructure must end. During the summit, Biden also discussed his request to Congress for additional funding for the World Bank that could generate more than $25 billion in new lending for economic development. The White House more broadly is trying to strengthen the G20 as an international forum, while Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin decided not to attend. Biden has said he was disappointed by Xi\u2019s decision. Asked again about the Chinese leader\u2019s absence, Biden said Saturday that the summit \u201cis going well\u201d though \u201cit would be nice to have him here.\u201d",

        "description": "Week Ahead 11th-15th SeptemberMON: Norwegian CPI (Aug)TUE: EIA STEO, OPEC MOMR; Swedish Unemployment (Aug), UK Unemployment (Aug) & Wages (Jul), NorwegianGDP (Jul), Germany/EZ ZEW (Sep)WED: IEA OMR; UK GDP Estimate (Jul), US CPI (Aug)THU: ECB Policy Announcement, Norges Bank Regional Network; Australian Employment (Aug), Swedish CPIF (Aug),US Retail Sales (Aug), IJC (w/e 4th Sep), New Zealand Manufacturing PMI (Aug)FRI: Quad Witching, CBR Policy Announcement, ECB TLTRO Repayment Publication; Chinese Industrial Output/Production, Retail Sales, House Prices (Aug), EZ Trade Balance (Jul), US Export/Import Prices (Aug), IndustrialProduction (Aug), NY Fed Manufacturing (Sep), Uni. of Michigan Prelim. (Sep)NOTE: Previews are listed in day orderNORWEGIAN CPI (MON): The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced.UK UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGES (TUE): Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end.UK GDP ESTIMATE (WED): A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought.US CPI (WED): Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern.ECB ANNOUNCEMENT (THU): 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%.AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYMENT (THU): participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%. There are currently no expectations yet for the upcoming data, while the release is not likely to have any major ramifications on RBA policy with the central bank more focused on inflation and given the upcoming changes, including the impending handover of leadership to Deputy Governor Bullock this month who will steer the Bank through next year\u2019s scheduled reforms.SWEDISH CPIF (THU): July\u2019s CPIF release was incrementally softer than market expectations, but at 6.4% YY remained above the Riksbank\u2019s 5.9% 2023 forecast and well above the 2% target level. As with other regions, the data will be scoured for any indications that the recent upturn in energy prices is making itself known. In addition, the Riksbank will be attentive to potential signs of the upside influencing other areas of the economy. For the Riksbank, the inflation data may factor into the communication used, but is unlikely to have much bearing on guidance for at least one more hike this year. On that, desks have been lifting their calls for the Riksbank given continued SEK weakness and the Bank's ongoing verbal intervention against it; for instance, the likes of Nordea expect hikes in September and November to a 4.25% peak.US RETAIL SALES (THU): Retail sales are expected to rise 0.2% M/M in August, cooling from the 0.7% gain in July. The ex-gas and autos measure is seen rising 0.4% M/M, down from a rate of 1.0% in July. While the data set will offer a glimpse on the health of the consumer amid concerns that the economy may slow significantly in the months ahead, traders will also be watching the University of Michigan's prelim survey release due Friday, where the rise in energy prices is likely to have weighed on sentiment.CHINESE ACTIVITY DATA (FRI): Retail sales Y/Y in August are expected to rise by 2.8% (prev. 2.5%), whilst there is currently no consensus for Industrial Production metrics. The data will be closely watched to diagnose the health of the world\u2019s second-larger economy and to gauge the drip-feed of stimulus seen over recent weeks. Using the anecdotal commentary from Caixin PMIs as a proxy, the release suggests that \u201cTrends diverged on a sector basis, with a renewed upturn in manufacturing sales counteracting a growth slowdown in the service sector.\u201d The Senior Economist at Caixin noted \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector improved in August, the services sector grew at a slower pace, and there was still considerable downward pressure on the economy\u2026 Looking ahead, seasonal impacts will gradually subside, but the problems of insufficient domestic demand and weak expectations may form a vicious cycle for a protracted period of time.\u201d To recap, the July data saw several downside surprises. Chinese Industrial Production YY printed at 3.7% vs. Exp. 4.4%, Chinese Retail Sales YY at 2.5% vs. Exp. 4.5%, and Chinese Urban Investment YTD YY 3.4% vs. Exp. 3.8%. The PBoC that day cut the MLF rate, the 7-day Reverse Repo rate, and the 7-day and 1-month SLF rates. ING analysts at the time warned, \u201cNow the idea of a consumer-spending-led recovery is looking very vulnerable.\u201d.This article originally appeared on Newsquawk This article was written by Newsquawk Analysis at www.forexlive.com.",
        "content": ": The prior reading was broadly in-line with the Norges Bank\u2019s own forecast and cemented expectations for the 25bp hike that was delivered in August. The August inflation release will be carefully scrutinised, firstly for signs of the energy upside that has been seen in other European inflation metrics, and secondly for any indication that such pressure is having an impact on other areas of the economy. Irrespective of the release, the Norges Bank has already guided participants towards another hike occurring in September given inflation remains markedly above target. Instead, the data will be more influential when assessing the new policy rate path, which as of June\u2019s MPR, looks for an end-2023 peak in the tightening cycle just shy of 4.25%. Evidently, if September sees a 25bp hike then this peak will be subject to an automatic upward revision, with the August inflation data and upcoming regional network survey likely the key factors in determining how much, if any, further tightening will be priced. : Expectations are for the unemployment rate in the 3M period to July to rise to 4.3%, whilst average earnings (ex-bonus) in the 3M/YY period to July are expected to fall to 7.6% from 7.8%. The prior report saw an unexpected jump in the unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.0%, whilst wage growth remained stubbornly high at 8.2% in the 3M/YY period for June with the caveat that the total growth rate was affected by the NHS one-off bonus payments made in June. This time around, ING flags that the September rate decision will hinge on three variables \u2013 services inflation (due the day before the next meeting), private sector wage growth and the vacancy/unemployment ratio (both due on Tuesday). For Tuesday\u2019s data, ING expects that headline wage growth will likely remain around 8.2%, albeit \u201cthere\u2019s an outside risk that we see this nudge slightly lower, on the basis that separate data from firms' payrolls indicated that median pay actually fell in level terms during August\u201d. Elsewhere, the desk expects a further modest rise in unemployment, as well as a renewed fall in vacancies. From a policy perspective, the BoE\u2019s September meeting is widely expected to see the MPC deliver another 25bps hike and therefore, the upcoming release might be more relevant for pricing beyond September, whereby markets assign a circa 60% chance of another hike by year-end. : A consensus is yet to be published for the data. The prior report saw M/M growth of 0.5% in June with the better-than-expected outturn attributed to a ramp-up in manufacturing production. This time around, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics (forecast -0.2% M/M) expect the upcoming release will likely show that the economy is sluggish but not sliding into recession. Looking under the hood, PM says it would \u201cbe shocked if manufacturing output didn't fall in July, after June's 2.2% month-to-month increase\u201d. Looking beyond the upcoming release, PM continues to expect GDP to rise by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 and by 0.3% in Q4, underpinned by a pick-up in households\u2019 real disposable income. From a policy perspective, it is likely that expectations for the September meeting will be guided more by developments in the labour market and on the inflation front with some in the market potentially cynical over relying too heavily on GDP data given the recent ONS revisions which revealed that the UK economy had returned to pre-pandemic levels much quicker than previously thought. : Headline inflation is expected to rise 0.5% M/M in August, picking up in pace versus the 0.2% M/M printed in July; the core rate is seen up 0.2% M/M, matching the prior month. Higher energy prices are likely to drive the headline up, but the core rate is seen steady. \"While inflation will continue to moderate, the path to 2% price growth will be slow and rocky,\" Moody's writes, \"the ongoing decline in used-vehicle prices will provide some downward pressure, but the biggest shoe yet to drop is related to housing and rent prices, where weakness from late 2022 has yet to show up in the CPI.\" Fed officials have recently been striking a balanced approach to guiding policy, welcoming the progress already made in bringing price pressures down, but noting that there is still further to go, while generally caveating their policy views around incoming data. From the market's perspective, the FOMC has already reached its terminal rate, and instead, the focus appears to be on when the central bank will begin to cut rates. Recent data releases have seen the timing swing towards May when the data has been weak, and out to July when data has been strong; the CPI data is likely to continue this pattern. : 39/69 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the ECB to stand pat on the deposit rate at 3.75% with the remaining 30 looking for a 25bps hike to 4.0%. Market pricing leans more in favour of a \u201cpause\u201d with such a move priced at around 63%. As a recap of the July meeting, Lagarde noted that the September decision will be based on the data and the Governing Council is \"open-minded\". Since July, Q2 Q/Q growth was revised lower to just 0.1% from 0.3% whilst more timely survey data saw the Eurozone composite PMI in August fall to 46.7 from 48.6 with the accompanying release noting that \u201cThe disappointing numbers contributed to a downward revision of our GDP nowcast which stands now at -0.1% for the third quarter\u201d. As such, the narrative around the Eurozone\u2019s growth outlook is a particularly negative one. Furthermore, interest rate increases are clearly having an impact on lending in the Eurozone with bank lending to the private sector at just 1.6% Y/Y in July. That being said, the fight against inflation is far from being won with August HICP holding steady at 5.3% Y/Y, the super-core reading still at an elevated level of 5.3% Y/Y and 5y5y forward expectations around the 2.6% mark. This puts the ECB in a bind of needing to be cautious in the face of slowing growth but not conveying a sense of complacency over inflation. Even though inflation is set to fall throughout the remainder of the year, the ECB has been consistent in its messaging that it will be following the actual data rather than projections; such a stance, it could be argued, would suggest that the Bank still has one more hike in its locker. Hawkish bodies on the GC such as Kazimir and Knot appear to subscribe to this view with the former suggesting that one more hike is still required; it remains to be seen how close to a consensus view this is on the GC with President Lagarde continuing to stress the Bank\u2019s meeting-by-meeting approach. If the ECB opts to keep rates steady, ING suggests \u201c\u2026an earlier end to PEPP reinvestments could eventually be the bargaining chip the doves would have to accept for the hawks to agree to a pause\u201d. For the accompanying macro projections, consensus expects the medium-term 2025 inflation projection to be revised lower to 2.1% from 2.2%. : participants will be eyeing the report to see if the labour market rebounds following the surprise contraction in July. As a reminder, the prior seasonally-adjusted reading was disappointing as the Employment Change showed an unexpected 14.6k decline in jobs (Exp. 15.0k increase), which was solely driven by a drop in full-time jobs and the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.7% vs. Exp. 3.6% (Prev. 3.5%), although in trend terms, employment actually increased by more than 27k and unemployment was steady at 3.6%.

        "description": "US President Biden and Vietnam's Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong expected to agree new partnership.",
        "content": "Just days ahead of US President Joe Biden\u2019s visit to Vietnam for key talks on trade and closer diplomatic relations, the president paid homage to events from an earlier and very different time \u2013 At the White House on Tuesday, Biden presented the Medal of Honor, the United States military\u2019s highest award, to 81-year-old Larry Taylor, a retired army captain who had flown a Cobra attack helicopter during the Under fire, out of fuel, and disregarding orders to return to base with his two-seater helicopter, Taylor persisted and saved the lives of four American soldiers who were surrounded by approximately 100 Vietnamese fighters. Taylor\u2019s actions \u201crewrote the fate of four families for generations to come\u201d, Biden said at the award ceremony. When Biden lands at Hanoi\u2019s Noi Bai International Airport on Sunday, he steps into a very different Vietnam and a phenomenally changed relationship with an old war foe. Biden is scheduled to meet the most senior leaders of Vietnam\u2019s Communist Party \u2013 the political organisation that was once an enemy \u2013 and is expected to sign agreements that elevate US relations to the highest level possible with Hanoi. \u201cThis visit is a remarkable step in the strengthening of our diplomatic ties,\u201d US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said ahead of the visit. \u201cIt reflects the leading role that Vietnam will play in our growing network of partnerships in the Indo-Pacific,\u201d Sullivan said. Both countries, he also said, had laboured to overcome the \u201cpainful shared legacy\u201d of the war, which resulted in the deaths of millions of Vietnamese and 58,000 US service members. While diplomatic ties and trade are foremost in the scheduled meeting between Biden and Vietnam\u2019s most powerful figure, Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, Washington also has its eyes set on China, which is increasingly in the Asia Pacific region. China will be watching Biden\u2019s visit closely, too, weakens Beijing\u2019s influence in Hanoi or alters strategic interests with its southern neighbour. Vietnam and the US are already signatories to a \u201ccomprehensive partnership\u201d, and speculation has focused on the elevation of relations to the highest level of a \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership\u201d \u2013 the most senior level in Vietnam\u2019s diplomatic hierarchy, said Le Hong Hiep, senior fellow and coordinator of the Vietnam Studies Programme at the ISEAS \u2013 Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. If that were to occur during Biden\u2019s visit, it would \u201crepresent a remarkable breakthrough in bilateral ties\u201d, Hiep wrote recently in the ISEAS Fulcrum online magazine. Vietnam \u201conly forms such partnerships with those that it views as of great importance for its security, prosperity, and international standing,\u201d Hiep said. If the agreement is signed, Vietnam will be inviting Washington into a club of just four other comprehensive strategic partners: China, India, Russia, and South Korea. While concerns over a backlash from China are credible, upgrading ties to such a level with the US at this time \u201cmakes perfect sense\u201d for several reasons, Hiep said. Washington\u2019s commitment to keeping the Indo-Pacific maritime area free and open aligns with Vietnam\u2019s interests amid China\u2019s regional muscle flexing. The US is also Vietnam\u2019s second largest trading partner (after China), but the US is, importantly, the largest export market for Vietnamese goods. As Hiep notes, it would be a \u201csensible move for Hanoi\u201d to have closer ties with such an important business partner. Timing is also important. It would be better to make the move to elevate ties with Washington now, before US-China competition sours even further, which could place Vietnam in a more tenuous situation when it came to making such a choice. Nevertheless, closer ties with the US do not mark a major shift in Vietnam\u2019s \u201cstrategic trajectory\u201d, as it is in Hanoi\u2019s best interests to pursue a \u201cbalanced foreign policy towards the major powers\u201d. Nguyen Khac Giang, a scholar of Vietnamese politics and visiting fellow at ISEAS, said the US may place more significance on the upgrade in relations with Vietnam, in terms of a counterbalance to China, than Hanoi has in mind. Vietnam sees the agreement as serving a variety of goals, including the rejuvenation of a struggling economy and strengthening public faith in Vietnam\u2019s foreign policy, Giang told Al Jazeera. For Vietnam, the \u201cupgrade carries both symbolic and practical significance, serving a range of interests from geopolitical counterbalancing to initiatives for economic diversification, making it a calculated risk worth taking,\u201d he said. Vietnam has skilfully balanced its relations with larger powers and it is not about to abandon that approach now, said Carl Thayer, emeritus professor at the Australian Defence Force Academy at the University of New South Wales. What has changed, however, is that Vietnam sees the importance of deepening economic ties with the US when China\u2019s economy is \u201cin deep trouble\u201d and the global economy is slowing. not only hurt its own economy but also had a severe impact on Vietnam\u2019s \u2013 as China is Vietnam\u2019s largest trade partner. The elevating of relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership is \u201cmainly about economics and technology\u201d, Thayer said, adding that such a move is not Hanoi being drawn into \u201can anti-China alliance\u201d with the US. \u201cVietnam will not take a step, in my view, with the US that threatens China\u2019s core interest or give the impression that Vietnam is aligning against China,\u201d Thayer told Al Jazeera. Giang, the scholar of Vietnamese politics, also said the upgrade in relations with Washington will not harm Hanoi\u2019s core interests either. \u201cHanoi likely believes it has the tools to ensure the regime\u2019s ideological core remains untouched by potential US influences,\u201d Giang told Al Jazeera. \u201cI don\u2019t foresee this enhanced relationship threatening the one-party state, especially since Washington has signalled its respect for Vietnam\u2019s existing political system.\u201d",

        "content": "Forbes Innovation Consumer Tech Android Circuit: Google Confirms Pixel 8, Microsoft Remembers Surface Duo, Honor Magic V2 Wins IFA Ewan Spence Senior Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Storyteller exploring digital worlds, mobile, music and podcasting Following Sep 9, 2023, 01:18pm EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Pixel Watch 2 confirmed specifications added, September 9th; article originally posted September 8th Taking a look back at seven days of news and headlines across the world of Android, this week\u2019s Android Circuit includes Google\u2019s official preview, Pixel 8 Pro details, Galaxy Z Fold 5 lessons, Galaxy S4 Ultra camera leaks, Honor Magic V2 Wins IFA, Microsoft Remembers Surface Duo, Xiaomi\u2019s increased Android support, and Android\u2019s new design. Android Circuit is here to remind you of a few of the many things that have happened around Android in the last week (and you can find the weekly Apple news digest here). Made By Google Teaser Video It may be a month away, but Google is building up some PR momentum around the \u201cMade By Google\u201d event on October 4th. The Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Watch 2, and Pixel Buds Pro 2 all appeared in Google\u2019s teaser video released earlier this week. We didn\u2019t get a look at the software, but the design was on full show: \"As expected, one of the two leaked color schemes is prominent in the video. The leaked \u201c Porcelain\" color that first appeared on one of the Google Store\u2019s internal pages last week is very much on show. What we don\u2019t see is any software running on the Pixel 8\u2019s screen.\" ( Forbes ). MORE FOR YOU Apple Leak Details All-New iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro Price Changes iOS 16 6 1 Update Now Warning Issued To All iPhone Users What To Know About IOS 16 6 1 Apple s Emergency Software Update Pixel 8 Pro Features That\u2019s not to say that extra details haven\u2019t leaked out away from the official videos. As well as the new colors, the temperature sensor, and the improved Tensor Mobile chipset, you have smaller details that will add to the value: \"The Pixel 8 Pro is also said to ship with a telephoto lens with a 5x zoom, though the features section does not specify if \u20185x\u2019 is lossless zoom or a combination of optical and digital zoom. Other additions such as NFC, mmWave antenna cover, and several microphones will find their way to the flagship.\" ( WCCFTech ). Update: September 9th: Pixel Watch 2 Specs Confirmed Part of Google\u2019s teaser video for the launch event saw a brief moment of the Pixel Watch 2, Google\u2019s second wearable under the Pixel brand. The company has now given the Watch pride of place in its own teaser video. Not only is the new digital crown on show, but the look at the rear panel shows an engraved IP68 rating alongside a raft of sensors: \u201c...the array of sensors seems to have been redesigned. While there could be any number of reasons for this, it adds credence to the suggestion that the Pixel Watch 2 will inherit the Fitbit Sense 2\u2019s continuous electrodermal activity sensor for measuring stress.\" ( Tom\u2019s Guide ). Folds, Z Folds, And Android Software Google\u2019s Pixel Fold may grab the attention, but Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold range is now in its fifth iteration. What software lessons can Samsung teach Google and, in turn, have them roll out across Android\u2019s large-screened devices? Mishaal Rahman suggests starting with multitasking: \"The Pixel Fold, in contrast, doesn\u2019t even have a search bar in its taskbar (yet), so it\u2019s awkward to select a second split-screen app when you initiate split-screen mode from the recents menu. Google\u2019s software does, at least, let you launch apps in split-screen mode from the home screen, unlike One UI. On the other hand, Google\u2019s software lacks arguably the best feature for split-screen multitasking: saving app pairs.\" ( Android Central ). An Ultra Camera For An Ultra Phone While the attention is on Google, details on Samsung\u2019s next flagship Galaxy handset have leaked. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is leaning heavily into the camera with some new technology expected: \"More notable is the claimed camera spec. The provision of a 200MP main sensor, a 12MP ultra-wide (presumably), and a 10MP telephoto is in keeping with the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, but this list appears to confirm previous claims that the S24 Ultra is set for a new 50MP 3x telephoto camera.\" ( Yogesh Brar via Trusted Reviews ). Honor Magic V2 Wins IFA Last week\u2019s IFA trade show in Berlin saw countless new consumer electronics previewed and launched. Naturally, there were some standouts, with Honor\u2019s second foldable smartphone picking up many \u201cbest in show\u201d awards. \"The Magic V2 offers larger displays inside and out than the obvious comparable models from Samsung and Google, but remains slimmer and lighter than both. It's also got a larger battery using cutting-edge silicon-carbon technology and upgraded camera sensors befitting a flagship phone. And if the current Honor Magic Vs is anything to go by, it'll be quite a bit cheaper than a Samsung or Google foldable in the markets where it's available.\" ( Tom\u2019s Guide ). Surface Duo Not Forgotten This week saw a surprising announcement from Microsoft. For all of the lack of action around the Android-powered Surface Duo, a new search function has been added to the folding dual-screened mobile device. Is it too little, too late, given the rise of foldable devices that have met and exceeded the promise of the Duo? \u201cAwesome new feature available for Surface Duo users - start a Bing Chat conversation from anywhere you find search on your Surface Duo or in Microsoft Launcher. \" ( Twitter ) Microsoft Surface Duo and Surface Duo 2. Ewan Spence Xiaomi Increases Android Support Another manufacturer has announced an increased support window for software. This week it is the turn of Xiaomi to push out to five years, extending the secure life of their latest smartphone: \"We are proud to announce a significant enhancement to our commitment to providing exceptional software support. Xiaomi 13T and Xiaomi 13T Pro will include 4 generations of Android OS upgrades, as well as 5 years of security patches.\" ( Xiaomi on Twitter ). And Finally... Google has refreshed the look and feel of the Android branding. The latest blog post goes into the design details for those wondering why small changes can have so much impact. \"With this update, you\u2019ll notice some subtle changes that help connect Android to Google. In addition to moving away from our longstanding lowercase stylization of \u201candroid,\u201d we\u2019re elevating the Android logo by capitalizing the \u201cA,\u201d adding more weight to its appearance when placed next to Google\u2019s logo.

        "content": "Half the fun of investing in stocks is digging through the markets to find undervalued gems and under-the-radar stocks with long-term potential. At the same time, markets are complex and the depth of information available is overwhelming. \u201cParalysis by analysis\u201d is a real affliction. It particularly affects newer investors as they learn how to separate the wheat from the chaff in under-the-radar stocks. As with any long-term investment strategy, three things matter. First, consider the broad economic conditions. Today, in an era of high(ish) interest rates and economic uncertainty, growth stocks and tech stocks are struggling. Depending on your risk appetite, this can present an opportunity to buy great stocks at bargain prices. Second, underlying fundamentals and financials matter \u2013 particularly in a tight economy. If a company can\u2019t withstand brief uncertainty based on its current financials, it doesn\u2019t matter how great its potential is. To that end, consider the long-term potential. Does the company have a viable product or service that\u2019s in demand and fairly protected from competition? These three companies have fundamental strength and long-term viability to weather (or even thrive) in today\u2019s economy. Each represents a perfect under-the-radar stock for those hunting for overlooked treasure. Under-the-Radar Stocks: Howmet Aerospace (HWM) Howmet Aerospace (NYSE: HWM ) is an aerospace company that manufactures and produces various materials and components for aircraft and aerospace end items. Of course, with space stocks set to hit a net value between $1 trillion and $10 trillion in the next few years, Howmet\u2019s long-term viability as a partner to major aerospace companies is clear. Today, Howmet ensures operational success through diversified products in the trucking industry. As global companies race to tighten up strained supply lines, trucking is a vital link in the chain. Likewise, by producing components for the trucks themselves, Howmet is vital to operational success even as trucking companies pivot to unmanned and autonomous operations . Howmet is financially successful and posted a profit in each of the past three years , with its most recent quarter marking a record $193 million net income . Its cash balance is also healthy, and the aerospace company has enough money to weather occasional down periods if they arise. SharkNinja (SN) SharkNinja (NYSE: SN ) is the definition of an under-the-radar stock, as it snuck onto exchanges via a spinoff in July to limited investor attention. The company might not be at the top of market players\u2019 minds, but it\u2019s a staple in kitchens and homes globally. The company makes and sells a range of appliances, including coffee makers, ice cream machines and hair dryers. Although firmly within consumer discretionary categories, the sluggish economy hasn\u2019t slowed SharkNinja. Instead, the company\u2019s sales have risen 20% each year since 2008. This year, management expects the trends to continue as trends point to $4 billion in revenue by December. Shares trade at a discount compared to similar, semi-luxury appliance brand competitors. Institutional investors are slowly taking note because of the company\u2019s broad appeal, proven strategy and financial readiness. One portfolio manager from Madison Avenue Partners said that SharkNinja is \u201ca gem that\u2019s about to be discovered,\u201d because \u201cSharkNinja has been able to produce new products in categories that haven\u2019t seen much innovation at attractive prices that delight consumers.\u201d Ultimately, any company able to sell higher-end discretionary products in today\u2019s economy is noteworthy. SharkNinja\u2019s success points to long-term upside potential for this under-the-radar stock. Robert Half Inc (RHI) The global job and labor market is changing, and firms like staffing agency Robert Half Inc (NYSE: RHI ) are positioned to ride the new trend to success. Notably, the company is pivoting away from low-margin activities, like temporary staffing solutions, and rotating into long-term contract sourcing. Notably, contract-to-hire models represent much higher margins for Robert Half. At the same time, they ensure a long-term revenue stream as the client and contractor\u2019s relationship matures. Likewise, these roles open opportunities for Robert Half to partner with more professional, skilled and experienced contractors. Ultimately, the move increases value to the client\u2019s organization and cements RHI\u2019s position in their workflow. Small business outsourcing is already booming, and digitization means Robert Half can deliver expertise to small business owners globally, no matter how remote the business is or how lacking local talent pools are. This demand makes matchmaking essential, and Robert Half is particularly well-suited to capitalize on emerging trends. This company and the ones listed above are all under-the-radar stocks that you should consider for your portfolio.

        "content": "In today\u2019s dynamic market, many investors are paying attention to the healthcare sector. The segment is known for its resilience and potential for growth. The ongoing global health crisis has only heightened this focus. Many are now seeking the best healthcare stocks to add to their portfolios. Numerous giants in the sector are trading at premium valuations. However, there are also a plethora of undervalued healthcare stocks that offer an attractive entry point. In addition to being affordable healthcare investments, these under-the-radar companies present an opportunity for significant returns. From biotechnology firms developing innovative therapies to companies revolutionizing medical devices and services, our list of cheap healthcare stock picks is curated with a forward-thinking approach. So, without further delay, let us look at some of the best healthcare stocks to buy. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH ) appears to be a beacon in the storm for savvy investors eyeing undervalued healthcare stocks. Although faced with a 6.52% dip in year-to-date return, a recent earnings report shows a glimmer of resilience. There was a 15.65% surge in revenue to $92.9 billion and a 7.97% climb in net income to $5.47 billion in the second quarter of 2023. This reveals a company robust and buoyant amidst a sea of challenges. However, sailing is not all smooth, as regulatory risks continue to loom large on the horizon. UnitedHealth Group stands out as an attractively priced compounder in a world where affordable healthcare investments are as sought after as a desert oasis. The current landscape, though dotted with challenges, is rife with opportunities for the discerning investor. One such challenge is CVS\u2019s (NYSE: CVS ) recovery journey after a PBM contract loss. Another is Humana\u2019s lawsuit against HHS over the Medicare clawback rule. Indeed, the path to cheap healthcare stock picks is paved with caution and promise. Balancing the scales of regulatory risks against the allure of strong financial performance and enticing pricing is key for anyone venturing into healthcare investments. This sector represents an exciting yet unpredictable terrain. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG ) is not just a company; it\u2019s a revolution in the making. A leader in minimally invasive care, the company is transforming how healthcare is delivered with its advanced robotic systems. The recent FDA approval of the da Vinci SP system for simple prostatectomies solidifies its role as a revolutionary force in the healthcare industry. Despite this, the company\u2019s stock experienced a 5% drop after-hours trading. However, this brief decline should not eclipse the company\u2019s ongoing commitment to innovation. Their continuous efforts towards progress are noteworthy and essential to consider. After all, true value often comes at a price. For investors on the hunt for affordable healthcare investments, Intuitive Surgical stands out as a top contender. Despite the necessary costs associated with its groundbreaking innovations, the company remains an appealing option in the sea of cheap healthcare stock picks. Suppose you want to diversify your portfolio while contributing to a future where advanced, minimally invasive care is the norm. In that case, Intuitive Surgical might be the investment you\u2019ve been searching for all this time. Teladoc Health (TDOC) Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC ) is gaining traction in the market and could be a top healthcare stock. Even though there has been a 10% decrease in the past half-year, the latest quarterly results displayed a hopeful 10% rise in revenue to $652.4 million, slightly surpassing predictions by 0.5%. Teladoc\u2019s collaboration with Microsoft to address clinical documentation through artificial intelligence is also a key development. This, along with the forecast that AI will constitute 11% of healthcare budgets in 2024, highlights the tactical decisions Teladoc is making. The expansion of Amazon Clinic nationwide contributed to the stock\u2019s recent fall, but Teladoc quickly recovered with a 6% increase following the earnings beat and positive 2023 guidance. The expanded strategic partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) also positions Teladoc as a powerful AI combo in the healthcare sector. AI is likely to spur healthcare deflation. As a result, Teladoc is a strong player in leveraging technology to revolutionize healthcare services. With the rise of AI in healthcare, Teladoc is positioning itself as a front-runner in the industry. Although the past quarter has declined, the company\u2019s strategic moves are promising. Additionally, technology advancements and strong partnerships indicate a positive trajectory for the future. Investors looking for cheap healthcare stock picks should consider the potential of Teladoc as it continues to innovate and expand its services in an ever-evolving market. With the support of strategic partnerships and innovative technology, Teladoc stands out as a robust and undervalued healthcare stock pick. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Despite a 10% drop year to date, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) remains one of the best healthcare stocks to watch. It demonstrates resilience with a 6% increase in net income and an 8% rise in diluted EPS in the second quarter of 2023. Additionally, it completed a lung cancer trial for Rybrevant and revised its financial outlook following the Kenvue separation. As indicated by Needham, the company\u2019s updated guidance and the MedTech market\u2019s anticipated 7% growth in 2023 make Johnson & Johnson an undervalued healthcare stock worth considering. Moreover, the company reported an annual dividend yield of 2.97%, which is good news for investors seeking regular income. With its recent positive updates and a growing MedTech market, Johnson & Johnson stands out among cheap healthcare stock picks. Despite the recent dip, its strong track record, robust dividend yield, and positive outlook for 2023 make it a compelling investment option. Pfizer (PFE) Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) has been a hot topic among the best healthcare stocks despite a rocky year-to-date return of -33%. Even though the recent earnings report showed a decline in revenue by 54.1% to $12.73 billion, net income dropped by 76.51% to $2.33 billion in July 2023. Despite these setbacks, the pharmaceutical giant remains an attractive proposition. This is especially true as Pfizer and BioNTech recently received endorsement from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) panel for their updated COVID booster. They also received the EU nod for a new Omicron-adapted COVID shot. These recent endorsements are significant in the context of a global pandemic. Moreover, an EPS beat of 15.28% in June 2023 indicates that Pfizer can still deliver positive surprises. Investors looking for affordable healthcare investments might view the recent dip in Pfizer\u2019s performance as intriguing. Despite the decrease in key financial metrics, Pfizer still plays a crucial role in the ongoing battle against COVID-19. In addition, it continues to be an essential addition to any dividend growth portfolio. Additionally, with the FDA reportedly set to clear updated COVID shots as early as Friday, significant upcoming catalysts can aid in the recovery of the stock. While the floor of this decline remains uncertain, Pfizer represents a doubling-down buying opportunity for investors aiming for long-term gains. As the world grapples with virus variants, Pfizer\u2019s role in global health remains more critical than ever. This makes it a compelling option among cheap healthcare stock picks.

        "content": "In 2021, federal policy action helped to cut child poverty in half and achieve the lowest child poverty rate in the . In a matter of weeks, however, the Census Bureau is poised to reveal that child poverty rates from 2021 to 2022, likely climbing back to their pre-COVID levels. What lessons should policymakers have learned from COVID-19 for maintaining low child poverty rates moving forward? This is the core question I ask in \u201c ,\u201d and I emphasize three of the many lessons here. First, if Congress wishes to get back to its record-low child poverty rate, it should return to the policy that made it possible: the expanded Child Tax Credit that, in 2021, provided cash payments to nearly all families with children regardless of parents\u2019 employment status. The consequences of the temporary CTC expansion were vast: it immediately cut monthly child poverty rates by around , contributed to the record-low child poverty rate in 2021, temporarily brought the U.S. child poverty rate in line with , had the American welfare state cutting child poverty , cut food hardship among families with children by , had no meaningful short-run consequences for , and increased low-income families\u2019 at child care centers and grocery stores. The pandemic not only provided evidence on which policies work to reduce children\u2019s exposure to poverty, but also the urgency of doing so: at the start of 2020, the average Black adult who was in poverty had also spent 57 percent of her childhood in poverty, compared to 20 percent for the average White adult in poverty. These disparate experiences of poverty, accumulating from birth onward, contributed directly to racial/ethnic disparities in health and employment outcomes at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cumulative exposure to poverty from childhood onward helps to explain why adults in the highest poverty counties in the U.S. had a COVID-related death rate nearly twice that of adults in the lowest-poverty counties, equivalent to the gaps in death rates between Germany and Romania in the EU. Poverty, after all, is not merely a point-in-time state, but an economic condition that, once experienced, often lingers throughout one\u2019s life, inflicting costs that range from poorer health conditions to reduced long-run economic opportunity. The 2021 CTC expansion worked in reducing those costs, but its discontinuation ensures that child poverty is poised to rise again. Second, if cross-party compromise is necessary to achieve an expanded, 2021-like CTC, then Democrats should be ready to to trade-in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.\u201cWelfare,\u201d as the program is commonly known, provided very little direct support for families during the pandemic: cash support from ; the expanded CTC, in contrast, cut child poverty rates by 44 percent the next year \u2014 15 times the magnitude of TANF. Meanwhile, state governments target toward Black families relative to White families, exacerbating racial differences in poverty targets. And TANF itself is shrinking each year: the program\u2019s annual funding level is not updated for inflation, ensuring that its overall cost, and also its trade-in value, decreases by the year. There are costs to abandoning TANF, but should the political balance of Congress require that it need to identify cost offsets in order to fund an expanded CTC at 2021 benefit levels, TANF should not be excluded from consideration. A third lesson: Congress should Invest more resources into the Census Bureau\u2019s data-collection capabilities to better track, in close to real-time, the well-being of households across the country. The pandemic revealed that our public data infrastructure is not prepared to inform month-to-month trends in poverty and hardship. As a result, researchers like me have had to get creative to track poverty on a , to measure exposure to across the country, and more. But knowledge of how low-income households are faring on a month-to-month basis should not be a result of researchers\u2019 data innovations; instead, adding four questions \u2013 one each on total resources received during the prior month, food insufficiency, mental health, and housing hardship \u2013 to the Census Bureau\u2019s and Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 monthly household surveys would offer representative and real-time measures of the well-being of the nation moving forward. The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us the importance of having timely and comprehensive data on poverty and well-being to guide policymaking decisions; these small changes would allow for that beyond the pandemic. There are several other key policy lessons that emerge from COVID-19 and that \u201c \u201d elaborates on. To name a few: we should learn from the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and expand access to Unemployment Insurance (UI) among jobless adults, even before prioritizing UI benefit increases. We should build the administrative capacity to convert the Paycheck Protection Program into a targeted work-sharing program. And we should convert some lump-sum, refundable tax credits to monthly payments to better help households with their everyday needs. The COVID-19 pandemic offered many lessons for improving economic well-being in the U.S. beyond the pandemic. We witnessed the menacing consequences of poverty, but also the enormous power and capability of the state to reduce poverty and improve well-being among households going through difficult times. To not apply these lessons moving forward would be a detriment to all those who happen to experience life in low-income America.",

Gemini currently has an F rating with the Better Business Bureau due to a failure to respond to multiple complaints, failure to resolve underlying causes for complaints, and the length of time the business takes to respond to a complaint. The BBB also notes that most complaints filed against Gemini after January 2021 were due to customers being unable to access bitcoin in their Gemini account. Many users also believe that Gemini's verification process for withdrawals and transfers slows transactions. In November 2022, Genesis stopped Gemini Earn investors from withdrawing crypto from their accounts due to Genesis' lack of sufficient liquid assets to meet withdrawal requests. The Gemini Earn program was then terminated . In February 2022, a Gemini crypto hack led to the loss of roughly $37 million in assets of clients with crypto IRAs held through IRA Financial Trust. IRA Financial Trust sued Gemini, and both Gemini and IRA Financial Trusts became the targets of client lawsuits. On January 12, 2023, the SEC charged a complaint against Genesis and Gemini, claiming unregistered offer and sale of securities to retail investors through the Earn program. As of September 2023, Gemini is pushing for a federal judge to dismiss SEC's claims for insufficient evidence. The charges are still pending. Is Coinbase Right for You?

DLP Capital currently has a C+ rating with the Better Business Bureau . BBB ratings range from A+ to F and reflect the bureau's opinion of how well a company interacts with its customers. Therefore, a C+ is an ok rating of customer trustworthiness. The BBB states that the reason for the C+ rating is due to a failure to respond to one complaint against the business. Before issuing ratings, the bureau also considers a company's time in business (including its business type), customer complaint history, licensing and government actions, and advertising issues. But its ratings don't absolutely ensure a company will be reliable or perform well. This is why it's important to also do your own homework before setting up an account. For better insight, talk with friends and family that have used DLP Capital and read customer reviews.

        "content": "Forbes Leadership Leadership Strategy Building Better Business Books: Insights From The Field Dan Pontefract Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. CEO, Author, Keynote Speaker, Leadership Strategist, Poet Following Sep 8, 2023, 05:13pm EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Photo by JOHN MACDOUGALL/AFP via Getty Images AFP via Getty Images I had the privilege of conversing with Josh Bernoff, author of the new book, \u201cBuild a Better Business Book: How to Plan, Write, and Promote a Book That Matters.\u201d Bernoff is a seasoned expert in the field of business writing. The insights from this conversation, drawn from Bernoff\u2019s extensive experience and unique perspective, are invaluable for anyone looking to make their mark in business literature. Bernoff brought up a few crucial and helpful points, including the following: 1. Business Books: Catalysts for Thought Leadership \u201cBusiness books are a way to propel thinkers to prominence,\u201d Bernoff shared. This statement underscores the power of business books. They are not just compilations of ideas or theories, but catalysts that can elevate thinkers to new heights of recognition. Bernoff\u2019s experience is a testament to this, with the book projects he\u2019s been involved in generating over $20 million for their authors. But the benefits extend beyond monetary gain. A well-crafted business book can bolster a career, establish authority in a field, and unlock doors to unexplored opportunities. It\u2019s about creating a lasting impact and contributing to the knowledge reservoir of the industry. It\u2019s about making a difference, and leaving a legacy that goes beyond the confines of personal achievement and extends to the broader business community. In the world of business, thought leadership is a coveted position. It allows you to influence, guide, and inspire. And a business book is a powerful tool that can help you achieve this position. You had better get the book right if you want to be a successful thought leader. 2. The Necessity of an Author\u2019s Platform In the digital era, an author\u2019s platform is an indispensable asset. \u201cThe platform supports the book,\u201d Bernoff pointed out. \u201cThe book is not the platform.\u201d MORE FOR YOU \u2018One Piece\u2019 Already Dethroned In Netflix\u2019s Top 10 List By A New Show Indian Billionaire Ranjan Pai Is Looking To Cement His Legacy With A Billion-Dollar Windfall. Is A Calculated Bet To Fund Troubled Startups The First Step? New Pixel 8 Pro Leaks Reveal Google s Smart Decision Whether through regular speeches or keynotes, a column in a trade magazine, a newsletter, or a significant social media following, a platform is a conduit to readers. It\u2019s a megaphone, amplifying ideas to the world. As Bernoff aptly put it, \u201cA book without promotion will just lie there, and it won\u2019t do much for you.\u201d Your platform can be a promotional powerhouse, ensuring a book doesn\u2019t just lie there but leaps into the hands of eager readers. But a platform is more than just a promotional tool. It\u2019s a bridge that connects you with your readers. It\u2019s a way to engage with your audience, understand their needs and interests, and provide them with value. It\u2019s a way to build a community of readers who share your passion for business and your desire to make a difference. 3. Engaging Readers: The Art of Creating Urgency While it may sound unconventional, Bernoff recommends a unique opening approach to a book. \u201cThe first chapter of your book needs to scare the crap out of people,\u201d he said. This doesn\u2019t imply resorting to shock tactics or sensationalism. Instead, it\u2019s about presenting a compelling problem or challenge to which a reader can relate while promising a solution. This scary first chapter creates a sense of urgency and curiosity, compelling the reader to continue reading to discover more. \u201cYou need to make them uncomfortable,\u201d Bernoff added, \u201cand then you need to make them comfortable by showing them that you have a solution.\u201d Engaging readers is about more than just grabbing their attention. It\u2019s about holding their interest, and keeping them hooked from the first page to the last. It\u2019s about creating a narrative that is not only informative but also compelling. It\u2019s about creating a narrative that resonates with the reader, speaks to their needs and interests, and provides them with value. 4. The Power of Stories and Evidence Bernoff emphasized the importance of stories and evidence in writing a business book. He said, \u201cYou need to fuel the book with case study stories about the kind of people who you\u2019re trying to help, what worked and what didn\u2019t work.\u201d This doesn\u2019t just happen; you have to put an enormous amount of effort into collecting those stories from your clients, from people you\u2019ve heard about, from the news, or by reaching out and collecting those stories elsewhere. When you start to write, the stories are the fuel that makes it possible for you to create an entertaining and interesting book. Stories and evidence are the backbone of any good business book. They provide the context and credibility that your ideas need to resonate with your readers. They bring your ideas to life, making them tangible and relatable. They make your book more than just a collection of abstract theories and concepts. They make it a guide, a roadmap that your readers can use to navigate their own business challenges. 5. The Importance of Differentiation Bernoff also highlighted the importance of differentiation in writing a business book. He said, \u201cYour book has to be the first book that makes it different from all the other books in the space that you\u2019re in.\u201d This differentiation could come in various forms. Your book might be the first to have actual data from consumers. Or it could be the first book with clear step-by-step instructions and diagrams on a new concept. Build a Better Business Book Josh Bernoff Differentiation is what sets your book apart from the rest. It\u2019s what makes it unique, what makes it stand out in a crowded marketplace. It\u2019s what gives your readers a reason to choose your book over all the others. It\u2019s the difference between your book being a must-read or a must-have resource for anyone looking to succeed in business versus other boring ones. Ultimately, the art of writing business books is a delicate balance of presenting compelling ideas, leveraging a platform, engaging readers, and aiming for a larger goal. It\u2019s about creating a narrative that not only informs but also transforms. It\u2019s about making a difference in the world of business, one book at a time. Build a Better Business Book: How to Plan, Write, and Promote a Book That Matters is an essential read for those would-be and already-established business book authors.

You can soon buy shares of Instacart stock on the Nasdaq following Instacart's IPO in September 2023. To buy Instacart stock, set up a brokerage account, research Instacart financials, and come up with an investment strategy. IPO stocks tend to go to institutions and high-net-worth investors first, so retail investors will have to be patient. The end of summer 2023 marks a new beginning for Instacart, as the popular grocery delivery and pick-up service announces that its initial public offering ( IPO ) is scheduled for some point in September 2023. After years of teasing a much-anticipated public offering, the time has finally come, making it one of the most high-profile US listings this year. However, retail investors may still have a hard time buying the stock as IPO shares are often reserved for high-net-worth investors, bankers, hedge funds , and large institutions. Right now, SoFi Invest is the only confirmed brokerage that plans to offer Instacart stock to its users. Here's how you can buy Instacart stock (CART). Learn how to buy shares in some of the largest US tech companies on the market. Here's how to buy Amazon stock and Insider's step-by-step guide on how to buy Apple stock . About the Instacart IPO On August 25, 2023, Instacart officially filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to become a publicly traded company. The business was founded in 2012 and over time has accumulated funding from 37 venture capital firms. The largest investors in Instacart to date have been Sequoia Capital and Capital Partners. The lead underwriters for Instacart's IPO are Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase. As a private company, only venture capitalists and certain high-net-worth individuals have previously been able to get their hands on Instacart shares (aka private equity). The main goal for private equity investors is to \"increase the company's profit from an exit,\" explains Matt Malone, head of investment management at Opto Investments . \"The exit could be an initial public offering (IPO), sale, or other liquidity event. Private equity investors are paid with proceeds from those exits.\" But that's all set to change. Soon retail investors will be able to find Instacart stock on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker \"CART.\" Retail investors are individual investors who use their own funds to buy, sell, and trade assets through brokerages/investment platforms. Not only will Instacart be the most notable US venture-backed tech IPO since December 2021 , but it will also be the first independent grocery delivery business to ever go public. While no one knows for certain how it will all shake out, it has been revealed that Instacart plans to sell $175 million in Series A preferred stock to PepsiCo . SoFi , one of the best robo-advisors , is underwriting Instacart's IPO with plans to offer shares to SoFi users. How to buy Instacart stock 1. Set up a brokerage account First things first, you must have a brokerage account in order to buy Instacart stock. Traditional and online brokerage accounts allow you to access the stock market, invest in various asset classes, and securely store your investments all in one place. \"A brokerage is where your investment portfolio lives \u2014 this can be directly with an investment institution, either self-managed or managed by a broker-dealer or registered investment advisory firm. An online brokerage does the same thing, but usually, these are either a DIY option or the company uses an algorithm to invest your portfolio,\" says Samantha Gorelick, CFP and managing financial planner at Brunch & Budget .

There are several brokerage platforms out there, each with different requirements, limitations, fees, web and mobile access, and resources. Some of the most well-known online brokerages include Charles Schwab , TD Ameritrade , Robinhood , and Interactive Brokers . SoFi Invest is the only brokerage known to hold Instacart shares with the intention of offering stock to its users. Therefore, opening an account with SoFi is not only your best option, but also your only option at this time. Brokerages other than SoFi that will offer Instacart IPO stock are still largely up in the air. You might also get some luck by opening an account with a broker that already offers IPO access. Robinhood, for example, offers IPO access to users through its IPO Access Program. But there's no guarantee that you'll get access to Instacart stock. You may also be able to invest in Instacart through mutual funds , such as Fidelity's Growth Company Fund. Fidelity recently bumped its Instacart Series H shares up 10% at the end of May 2023. 2. Research Instacart financials While investing in a big name like Instacart may sound like a safe investment decision, it's essential that you do your due diligence first and conduct your own research. Although you can't review Instacart's historical stock performance, you can still tune into the company's recent profit history and current market standing. Some key resources to analyze include: Company quarterly earnings reports Income statements Balance sheets After skyrocketing during the COVID-19 pandemic and reaching its peak in Q2 of 2022, Instacart found itself steadily declining as inflation marked up prices on groceries and as people returned to shopping for themselves. Last year, the company cut its valuation multiple times. However, in 2023, Instacart raised its valuation to about $12 billion . Instacart closed 2022 with $428 million in profits. During the first six months of 2023, Instacart reported a profit of $242 million. That's a significant increase compared to what the company earned during the same period the previous year . Despite its recent success, higher grocery prices and economic concerns could hurt Instacart's success in the long run. 3. Determine how much to invest and place an order In general, how much you want to invest depends on your individual investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. It also depends on the price of the shares and how much you're looking to spend. There are four main types of orders you can make when requesting the share price you want: Market order : Orders are immediately executed so that the per-share price currently reflects the stock's current share value. But you can't set the share price before executions, which doesn't make it ideal for investors hoping to bear the stock's current market value. Limit order : You can set a price threshold for shares for buying and selling stock. This is best for investors who want control over how much they are spending on shares. For example, if Instacart stock is trading at $200, and you set your limit order for $150, the brokerage won't complete your order unless the stock's value drops to your limit order price. Stop order : Also called stop-loss order, this order type allows you to set a stop price. That means that if your stock reaches the stop price, it will become a market order and be executed immediately. Stop-limit order : Similar to a stop order, this type of order allows you to establish a set price to stop for your stock's value. But instead of becoming a market order, your order becomes a limit order when your stocks reach the established stock price. But just because you request a certain number of shares doesn't guarantee that you'll get it. As mentioned above, IPO shares tend to be reserved for high-net-worth individuals and intuitions, so retail investors may struggle to get in on the action. Plus, brokers only have a set number of shares available, so you'll have to be patient. 4. Review your purchase and monitor your investment Getting the shares is only the first step in turning a profit. You'll need to implement an investing strategy, such as a buy-and-hold strategy or dollar-cost averaging. This way, you won't be glued to the market hour by hour watching Instacart's stock chart. Here are some common investing strategies: Buy-and-hold : This investment strategy is most appealing to passive and long-term investors. After purchasing a lump sum's worth of Instacart stock, you can sit back and wait for your shares to increase in value over time. You won't cash out until you feel the time is right. Dollar-cost averaging : If you want to regularly contribute to Instacart, this strategy may be a good fit. Instead of purchasing a large sum at once, you can determine how much you're wanting to periodically invest (e.g., $10, $50, $100). As with an investment, no investment is immune to the fluctuations of the stock market. In the event of a struggling economy or a bear market , share prices may drop drastically. Make sure to keep cool and don't make any rash decisions. \"The risk of loss is possibly the greatest risk when investing your money. Diversification can help to mitigate this risk,\" says Gorelick.

Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Instacart's upcoming IPO will put its shares on the stock market. Previously, Instacart was a private company so the general public could not buy shares of the top-performing grocery-delivery company. Instacart plans on trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker CART at some point in September 2023. Is Instacart on NYSE? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Instacart is not currently traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Instacart is set to launch its IPO and be traded on the Nasdaq starting in September 2023. Should you buy Instacart stock? Investors have been awaiting Instacart's IPO for some time, and now the time has finally come. But retail investors may have to wait a bit longer as certain high-net-worth investors, intuitions, and firms typically get first dibs on IPOs. In order to buy Instacart stock, you'll need a brokerage account to gain access the market and have a secure place to store your investments. As investing in individual stocks are highly risky, you may want to invest in other assets like ETFs, mutual funds, index funds, or real estate. A diverse investment portfolio should be a key part of your financial plan . Make sure to do your due diligence and research Instacart's financials and market history before buying in. If you're having trouble getting started, a certified financial planner ( CFP ) or financial advisor can help.

        "content": "The BRICS alliance inducted six new countries into the bloc at the 15th summit in Johannesburg last month. Out of the six countries, five are oil-producing nations that export millions of barrels across the globe every year. The six countries joining BRICS are Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Iran, and Ethiopia, while Argentina is the only non-oil-producing country. There\u2019s a high risk that Saudi Arabia and the UAE might start accepting local currencies for oil and ditch the U.S. dollar. The new mission of BRICS is to end reliance on the U.S. dollar and promote for global trade. Therefore, chances are high that Saudi Arabia might consider accepting local currencies as payment for oil to reduce its dependency on the U.S. dollar. BRICS is looking to control the oil markets, and inducting Saudi Arabia was the best choice. In this article, we will highlight what could happen to the U.S. dollar if Saudi Arabia accepts local currencies to settle oil and gas payments. BRICS: Here\u2019s What Could Happen to the U.S. Dollar if Saudi Arabia Demands Local Currencies For Oil First and foremost, the weakening of the U.S. dollar would begin if Saudi Arabia accepted local currencies for oil trade. If Saudi Arabia demands that other countries pay in local currencies only, then demand for the U.S. dollar would dip drastically. The move could lead to the dollar facing a depreciation in the international forex and currency markets. A weak dollar would make imported goods more expensive in the United States and potentially impact the overall U.S. economy. Secondly, other nations will begin to diversify their reserves and accumulate other currencies apart from the U.S. dollar. The development would increase demand for other local currencies and put them in direct competition with the dollar. Central Banks around the world will keep reserves of all currencies and commodities like gold, making the USD dip. Thirdly, and in conclusion, Saudi Arabia might not make such a decision as their currency, the Riyal, is pegged to the U.S. dollar. Therefore, if the dollar dips, the Saudi economy could face implications that could hamper the kingdom\u2019s wealth and local currency.",

The post 3 Cybersecurity Stocks to Invest In for Big-Time, Long-Term Gains appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Did cybersecurity companies win second-quarter earnings season? It certainly appears that way after nearly all of the leading cybersecurity companies beat Wall Street forecasts, sending their share prices up 10% or more as a result. While mega-cap tech stocks posted mixed Q2 results, and disappointing retailers complained about in-store theft, cybersecurity firms hit one homerun after another on growing demand for their products and services. Cybersecurity remains one of the fastest growing areas of technology right now. Consulting firm McKinsey & Co. sees a $2 trillion market for cybersecurity as businesses and individuals worldwide increasingly rely on more sophisticated products to protect them from cyberattacks, identity theft, and to manage access to their various electronic devices. Now viewed as a necessary business expense, spending on cybersecurity is likely to only accelerate in coming years. Here are three cybersecurity stocks to buy and hold right now. Palo Alto Networks (PANW) Shares of Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW ) jumped 12% at the end of August as the cybersecurity company issued financial results that were much better than expected on Wall Street. It was a relief rally of sorts as PANW stock declined 16% leading up to Q2 print and investors worried that the company\u2019s decision to announce its results after markets closed on a Friday was a sign of problems. Not so, as it turned out. Palo Alto Networks reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.44 versus $1.28 that had been expected by analysts who cover the company. Revenue in the quarter ended July 31 totaled $1.95 billion versus $1.96 billion that was anticipated. Revenue rose 26% from a year earlier as demand for the company\u2019s cybersecurity products grows stronger. While the company\u2019s forward guidance came in softer than analysts would have liked, the overall view appears to be that Palo Alto Networks remains a leading cybersecurity concern. PANW stock has now risen 75% this year and is up 220% over five years. CrowdStrike (CRWD) Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: CRWD ) is another among the cybersecurity stocks to buy and hold now. It too reported better-than-expected results at the end of August, sending its share price higher as well. The company announced Q2 EPS of 74 cents, which was far ahead of Wall Street\u2019s consensus forecast of 56 cents. Revenue during Q2 came in at $731.6 million, up 37% from a year ago. That too was ahead of analyst expectations of $724.1 million. Free cash flow stood at $188.7 million at the quarter\u2019s end, up 39% from $135.8 million a year earlier. Looking ahead, CrowdStrike said it expects revenue of $775.4 million to $778 million and 74 cents in earnings for the current third quarter. Wall Street had been looking for $774 million in revenue and 60 cents in profits for the current third quarter. Analysts and investors had nothing to quibble about regarding the Q2 results and forward guidance. Consequently, CRWD stock has risen nearly 10% in recent weeks even as the broader market has pulled back. CrowdStrike\u2019s shares have now gained 60% this year and are up 157% through five years. Okta (OKTA) Rounding out the parade of strong earnings, we have Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA ). The company\u2019s share price vaulted 10% higher immediately after it reported its latest financial results. The company, which specializes in identity verification and access management, posted Q2 EPS of 31 cents on revenue of $556 million. Analysts who track the company had penciled in earnings of 22 cents on revenue of $535 million. Okta also raised its guidance and provided a strong outlook for both Q3 and all of this year, leading investors to cheer. Okta, which uses cloud identification software that enables people to access multiple platforms with a single sign-on, said it is benefitting from the successful integration of several acquisitions it made over the last few years. The improved financials and positive guidance led many analysts on Wall Street to revise up their targets on OKTA stock, with investment bank Guggenheim Securities lifting its target on the share price to $100 from $96 previously. OKTA stock has gained 26% this year and is up 22% over the past five years.

        "content": "A Chinese woman managed to secure employment at 16 different companies without showing up for a period of three years. What Happened: A woman identified by the pseudonym Guan Yue orchestrated a labor fraud scheme amassing nearly $7 million, Chinese newspaper Xinmin reported. Guan meticulously documented her employment details on paper and would share pictures from her job interviews on her work channels, pretending to be engaged with clients, according to the outlet. When the number of job offers became unmanageable, Guan reportedly delegated the roles to acquaintances, retaining a portion of the earnings as commission. The proceeds from the operation, which she conducted with her husband, were substantial enough to purchase an apartment in Shanghai, and were funneled through various bank accounts, Xinmin reported. The intricate fraud came undone in January, after an internet-tech CEO by the pseudonym Liu Jian noticed an employee inadvertently revealing his employment at another firm while working for the CEO. This led to the discovery of a larger group involved in the scheme, including its leader identified as Yang Hong . Following a police investigation, a total of 53 individuals were apprehended. Also Read: Workplace Wisdom: Lessons In Happiness From A 90-Year-Old With A 74-Year Career At Dillard's According to Xinmin, this kind of labor fraud is rampant in China. An estimated 700 to 800 groups of scammers have secured jobs using counterfeit resumes and passing interviews. The groups have reportedly become proficient in navigating employment laws to avoid criminal charges, often settling disputes through arbitration. In one notable instance, a group even managed to infiltrate a company by having one of its members hired as the HR representative, who subsequently facilitated the employment of other group members. While the latest case has brought this issue to the forefront, it highlights a significant challenge in China's corporate sector , raising questions about the efficacy of the hiring process and the extent of labor fraud in the country.

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Here's why Meta Platforms remains a top option in the technology space for long-term value investors in this current environment. The post META Stock Outlook: 3 Catalysts That Could Fuel Meta Platform\u2019s Next Rally appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) had a turbulent 2022, plunging from a high of roughly $380 per share to the $88 level, and then more than tripling in early 2023. At around $300 per share at the time of writing, META stock has certainly become one of the come back stories investors like to see. Those who have held this stock through the turbulence are none the worse for the wear, especially if those same investors bought the stock years ago. Of course, n ews often mirrors stock performance, and it\u2019s crucial to remember the negative headlines about Meta during its decline. Now, optimism abounds for many large-cap tech stocks . That said, investors must consider whether it\u2019s overvalued or rightfully bullish after its roughly 10% decline from its recent peak. Here are three catalysts I think are worth watching when it comes to Meta right now. Meta Platforms is Being Re-Rated Higher Among 42 analysts , 40 rate Mets Platforms stock as \u201cbuy,\u201d with none issuing a recent \u201csell\u201d rating, despite its August decline. Analysts, like Scott Devitt from Wedbush, see potential in Meta\u2019s job cuts leading to improved margins. Devitt notes enhanced monetization in newer areas like Reels and click-to-message ads, setting a $350 price target for META stock. Similarly, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) analysts, with a $375 price target, anticipate renewed enthusiasm for Meta\u2019s stock in 2024 once spending targets are clearer. As more analysts jump on Meta Platforms as a potential long-term opportunity, I expect more price target hikes and upgrades on the horizon. Strong Fundamentals Meta stands out in the tech sector with just 21.6% of its capitalization comprised of debt, a modest figure compared to other tech firms. Meta\u2019s free cash flow, around $24 billion this year , surpasses its total debt of approximately $37 billion, a rarity in the corporate world. This robust cash flow has allowed Meta to repurchase 101 million of its own shares in the past year, benefiting shareholders and boosting stock prices. Meta\u2019s return on invested capital (or ROIC) historically ranged from 15% to 20%, ensuring that the money used for stock buybacks generates similar returns for shareholders. While criticism exists for Meta\u2019s investment in the metaverse, which has yet to yield expected profits, it has lowered ROIC to 14%, still strong compared to many companies. Meta\u2019s robust fundamentals extend to its market share, with Facebook commanding 53.1% of all social media visits (excluding Instagram). This significant presence offers multiple avenues for monetization, irrespective of the metaverse\u2019s success. AI Is The Main Near-Term Catalyst Meta Platforms understands the need for substantial investments in specific areas. It\u2019s a manageable challenge as long as the company can maintain strong revenue growth. While Q2 2023 showed an 11% year-over-year revenue increase, the focus now shifts to what will drive revenue growth in the latter half of 2023 and 2024. Meta Platforms is said to be working on an AI bot for enhancing business customer service and an internal AI tool designed to boost staff productivity. Of course, given the attention around artificial intelligence of late, this has garnered some attention. That said, over the longer-term, we\u2019ll have to see how this actually impacts the company\u2019s bottom line (if it\u2019s more or less like Meta\u2019s move into the metaverse, for example). What Now for Meta Platforms? While Meta shifts its focus to Threads and monetizing Instagram/WhatsApp, the metaverse project might lose some prominence. However, analysts expect double-digit earnings per share growth (around 26.7%) over the next twelve months, which could propel the stock higher, given the historical link between EPS and stock prices. Consider the potential if they redirect metaverse spending is redirected elsewhere, possibly restoring ROIC to its historical levels. This could result in more substantial share buybacks and higher analyst targets due to improved monetization and ROIC. Investors should seize this opportunity. On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a LONG position in META. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines .",

        "description": "Brian Ward, CEO of Savvy Gaming Group, is trying to change Saudi Arabia's reputation by leading its investments in gaming.",
        "content": "We're thrilled to announce the return of GamesBeat Next, hosted in San Francisco this October, where we will explore the theme of \"Playing the Edge.\" Apply to speak here and learn more about sponsorship opportunities here. At the event, we will also announce 25 top game startups as the 2024 Game Changers. Apply or nominate today ! Brian Ward, CEO of Savvy Games Group , has taken the lead in helping Saudi Arabia\u2019s attempt to move beyond its reputation for human rights abuses and being an oil nation to being a visionary technology leader bankrolling the game industry. This tension between the past and the future is ever-present in Saudi Arabia, where companies like Savvy Games Group \u2014 owned by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia \u2014 are trying to change perceptions through games while remaining cognizant of the kingdom\u2019s appetite for measured change. Ward believes people have to see the change happening in society on the ground in Saudi Arabia in order to understand how quickly things can happen under the new regime that is mostly supportive of the game industry. There is perhaps no other country where the clash between tradition and modernity \u2014 something my world history professor talked about so long ago \u2014 is so stark. The change and the deals have been happening at a dizzying rate. It\u2019s like a big game of Monopoly, and the playing board of the game industry is set up on a global scale. Savvy Games Group acquired Los Angeles-based mobile game publisher Scopely for $4.9 billion in April, and it bought a $1 billion stake in Sweden-based game publisher Embracer Group. It also acquired ESL Gaming and FaceIt in esports to create ESL FaceIt Group. And the Saudis have also bought stakes in Capcom, Nexon and Nintendo this year, building on stakes it acquired previously in Activision Blizzard, Take-Two Interactive and Electronic Arts. That has made the gaming world take notice. Savvy\u2019s big stakeholder, the Public Investment Fund (run by the Saudi Arabian government) is flush with cash from the oil boom and it has set aside $37.8 billion to build up Saudi Arabia\u2019s presence in the global games industry \u2013 with $13.3 billion of that earmarked for acquiring a major publisher. That\u2019s more money than anyone around the world is earmarking for gaming investments and acquisitions. It\u2019s a sign that the government is serious about weaning the country from oil. The Saudi Vision 2030 is a government program launched by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to diversify economically, socially and culturally, in line with the vision of bin Salman. The Saudis announced it in 2016, but the country remained about 74% dependent on oil exports as of 2021. The country understands that the oil economy could dry up in the next 27 years, and it has to have other jobs ready \u2014 and they are trickling in so far. For the games industry, this influx of Saudi money into games is not without controversy, as the Saudi funding is controversial and the company has only been at it since November 2021. Critics say that the regime of Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud doesn\u2019t respect human rights. As crown prince and prime minister, he was connected to the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 via alleged killers who had ties to the crown prince. Accepting funding from the Saudis under such a regime represents a moral quandary, as the Saudis have become a big source of funding in their efforts to diversify beyond their dependence on oil, which the world is in the process of moving away from in pursuit of clean energy. Saudi defenders say that all major sources of money in the world are tainted in some way, and accepting money from the Saudis does not mean you have to accept interference from the Saudis or embrace their agenda. Ward pointed out in an interview with GamesBeat that the country is undergoing change when it comes to women\u2019s rights and other freedoms, and it is serious about creating transformative results when it comes to diversity and new jobs associated with game studios. Still, given the fact that being gay is illegal in Saudi Arabia, The Last of Us Part 2 was banned in the country for having gay women in its leading roles. Ward has said the company aims to become a great games company and is not tied to a specific political agenda and he is not there for an \u201cimage makeover project.\u201d While change may be happening, it\u2019s not happening fast enough for critics. I caught up with Ward in an interview at the company\u2019s booth at the Gamescom expo in Cologne, Germany. Here\u2019s an edited transcript of our interview. Brian Ward: Sorry I wasn\u2019t able to meet before. GamesBeat: You guys were busy buying somebody. Brian Ward: That was a hectic time. GamesBeat: How are things going since then? Especially with acquiring Scopely. Ward: Very good. We\u2019re obviously delighted to have closed the transaction with Scopely. Their Monopoly Go product is fantastic. It\u2019s doing very well. The people are working super hard on integration. They\u2019ve been a pleasure to work with in that regard. So far we\u2019re delighted. GamesBeat: On things like esports, I wonder how much focus you have on MENA (Middle East/North Africa) versus the wider world. Ward: We\u2019re pretty globally focused. The live attendance on all the majors this year has been up. The viewership, the hours watched have been up. There have been some hiccups in the sector generally with publisher spend on esports this year, but overall the business has been doing great. We\u2019re focused on MENA, of course. The EFG folks are in the middle of executing on Gamers8. There are plans for that tournament to be bigger and more robust next year. There\u2019s a lot going on. The conference next week will be a good one. GamesBeat: Is that a first for them, or have they been doing them before? Ward: This is the second version of Next World Forum. Gamers8 started during COVID as Gamers Without Borders, for charity relief. This is the second version of both the G8 and the NWF. GamesBeat: Is there a feeling of progress as you come out of COVID? Esports had to take some huge hits during that time. It transformed a lot as well. Ward: I think we\u2019re beyond COVID. The capital markets, the economic situation last year and coming into this year, caused some publishers to pull back on their esports spend, which affected a couple of pieces of the business, but overall attendance is up. Viewership is up. There seems to be as much engagement as there was before from a fan point of view. GamesBeat: For Saudi gamers and Saudi esports fans, how would you describe the market? Ward: When we invested in EFG, it seemed that coming out of COVID \u2013 that was nearly two years ago now \u2013 it was an inflection point where engagement had changed or accelerated because of COVID, and there would be some consolidation in esports. There would be some dynamics that would sort themselves out, whether it\u2019s the relationship between players and teams and publishers and where the power base really sits. A lot of that still has to get sorted out. Team economics are not universally great. GamesBeat: The game industry itself, where do you see the trends developing? Ward: We\u2019re super excited, especially on the heels of closing Scopely. We\u2019re excited about mobile-first cross-platform opportunities. Scopely is also making great progress in direct payments. That\u2019s an interesting economic lever for us. For Savvy, we now have a great anchor in mobile. We\u2019re looking forward to figuring out how we can facilitate, like we\u2019re doing with Scopely, some partners in PC and console. GamesBeat: You\u2019re still looking around for opportunities? Ward: This year we haven\u2019t been looking at as many opportunities. We\u2019ve been focused internally on making sure we have the right leadership team in place. Scopely is a big acquisition. The integration is fairly involved. We\u2019re focused on making sure that we\u2019re putting some investment professionals in place, so we don\u2019t rely on external advisors as much. We\u2019re focused internally on our structure and governance and operating model, more so than looking for additional investments. GamesBeat: Were there some things that made you think that the period in which you were buying assets there \u2013 was that fortuitous in some ways? When there are downturns in the economy, prices for acquisitions are lower. It\u2019s a good time to buy. Did that matter to you? If you have strategic imperatives to move into a business fast, you probably don\u2019t care as much about the economic situation. Ward: That\u2019s true. It\u2019s very difficult to time the market. It\u2019s been fortuitous that valuations have come off a bit and those people with capital to employ have been in a market where it\u2019s been more difficult for people to find as many varied sources of capital as there were two years ago. That\u2019s advantageous to us. But we haven\u2019t pulled on that lever very hard. This year we\u2019ve been focused more internally. GamesBeat: For games it seems like there was a lot of pressure on valuations, after some very big excitement in 2021. Everybody thought that usage was going to go up forever. Is there a level-setting that you see that still reflects favorable trends? Ward: Overall, I think the trends are super favorable for the long term. We don\u2019t get too excited about this year versus last year or 2022 versus COVID. Long term we think this is probably the best entertainment business to be in. Yes, there\u2019s some sort of reconciliation. Figuring out where usage and engagement will land after COVID. But that will settle. GamesBeat: I listened to Take-Two\u2019s earnings call. It was interesting to hear Strauss Zelnick answer a question about games and Hollywood, all the synergy happening right now. Someone asked why they aren\u2019t doing more of that. He said, \u201cWe came from movies. It was a very hard business. There were many failures.\u201d For years everyone saw that the big opportunity was in games, so why would they go back in a big way? Although he did say that they\u2019re working on a Borderlands movie and some other projects. They\u2019re participating in that. But he felt like it was a no-brainer that gaming is still the more interesting business. Ward: It\u2019s kind of the flip side of the trend from 20 years ago, where movies became games. Now it\u2019s games becoming movies. GamesBeat: Do you think about that as an opportunity as well? Ward: Not yet. We\u2019re not focused on that at the moment. I still view us as a startup. We have maybe a couple hundred people in Saudi Arabia and 4,000 worldwide. We still have a lot of things to do in terms of building a games business. We have a pretty good esports business. GamesBeat: Are you focused on building a larger local staff? Ward: Very much so. The studio, which is now renamed Steer Studios, has done a super job. They now have about 80 people on two or three mobile teams, and 80% of them are Saudis. We\u2019re highly focused and highly incentivized against building out the local ecosystem. GamesBeat: How does that mix in with the Scopely business? Is it alongside Scopely? Ward: Scopely is very interested in the MENA region and expanding beyond their traditional markets. We expect that they\u2019ll be looking at opportunities in MENA and Saudi specifically. GamesBeat: How do you look back after some years on the issues around human rights that people have had with Saudi Arabia, whether or not they want to do business there? How is that turning out? Ward: My standard answer to this, or part of my standard answer, is for folks to take the time to understand what\u2019s going on there and how far this social transformation and economic diversification project is coming in the last five years. A tremendous amount of progress has been made toward Vision 2030 and all of this transformation. It\u2019s exciting. We\u2019re super happy to be part of it, part of this long-term journey. GamesBeat: Is there some sense of mission attached to that connected to Savvy? Ward: This is what really attracted me to this position and got me to move to Riyadh. I understood a bit about Vision 2030 and the economic diversification, social transformation aspect. But once I saw, once I visited for the first time and saw what that meant on the ground, I could see that this is kind of like China 35 years ago. The pace of change is astonishing. It seemed to be a unique opportunity to take part in something worthwhile. That\u2019s why I went there, and I think a lot of the people we\u2019ve hired and who have moved there are inspired by the same opportunity. GamesBeat: The flow of money into games, do you have any general observations about that? Is there some history to that flow? I just remember that when I joined VentureBeat 15 years ago, I thought I would stop covering games. There was a focus on venture capital for (tech), and there was (virtually) no venture capital for games. I thought I\u2019d end up covering tech more than games. But here we are 15 years later and GamesBeat is very big. Ward: You would know far more about this, but the level of engagement and the fan base and reach now of games, for those of us who\u2019ve been doing this almost 30 years \u2013 I remember thinking, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if we were eventually bigger than the music industry?\u201d Now we\u2019re bigger than those guys and the movies and somebody else put together. When you think about 3.2 billion people on the planet playing games on a regular basis, it\u2019s astonishing. GamesBeat: Saudi Arabia is also into building new cities and new structures. Do you have some sort of dream for that? How would building cities with games in mind happen? Ward: As you know, Vision 2030 encompasses all of those things. The giga-projects at NEOM and Qiddiya, which have significant \u2013 I mean, Qiddiya is essentially an entertainment-based city being built just west of Riyadh. We have a big part to play in the game section of that city. NEOM has a big games component to it as well. All these things are tied together under not only Vision 2030, but the national strategy for games and esports. Saudi, to my knowledge, is the only country on the planet that\u2019s announced a national strategy backed by the government for our sector. All of these things are interconnected in some pretty major ways. GamesBeat: The one hiccup that we\u2019ve seen lately is whether or not you were going to do the investment in Embracer. I don\u2019t know how you would signal to the rest of the market what that means. That particular deal is one that maybe wasn\u2019t going to happen. Is there any change in strategy? Ward: We don\u2019t have a change in our strategy. Our strategy has been consistent for the last two years. When we made our initial significant investment in Embracer, we had great faith in the leadership and the long-term strategic vision for Embracer. That hasn\u2019t changed either. We\u2019re very happy with our investment in Embracer over the long term. GamesBeat: The interest in doing large deals, is that still part of what you want? Ward: I think Scopely is the sixth-largest M&A deal in our industry\u2019s history. We\u2019re still interested, and we\u2019ve deployed maybe 25% of the capital designed to be allocated to us over the long term. We still have a significant part of our mandate to fulfill. GamesBeat: Do you have an interest in making sure you\u2019re not perceived as investing at valuations that are too high, or throwing too much money at your targets? Ward: We employ a lot of excellent and well-paid advisors to give us good opinions on these things. We trust the advice they give us. We think we\u2019ve done deals that have been very beneficial to Saudi and fair to both parties. If we looked at the transaction value on Scopely today we\u2019d be very pleased with how that\u2019s working out, given our mission. It\u2019s long term. People probably thought Amazon paying a billion dollars for Twitch was crazy at the time. GamesBeat: The good old days, when prices were low. For women in Saudi Arabia, do you feel like there are real opportunities for change for them? Ward: This is the thing that surprised me. I didn\u2019t have any personal knowledge or experience of the region. To see firsthand what was going on there in relation to opportunities for women, just generally speaking, was a real eye-opener. In a studio, which has nearly 80 people so far \u2013 this is a development studio. Almost 30% of that workforce are women. At any studio anywhere in the world that would be a pretty remarkable number. There\u2019s an equally high percentage of women in the Saudi workforce generally. It\u2019s exciting. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019m really happy about. When the Scopely guys came to visit, around the time of the closing, or just prior to the closing, we had a lunch for Scopely leadership and all of the local women employees in Saudi. The Scopely folks said they were blown away by the level of energy, enthusiasm, knowledge, and professionalism in that group. One of them said he wished he could bottle up that energy and take it back to California. GamesBeat: U.S. money has been going all over the world for decades. I suppose you could put an interpretation on that money. When China was also in the position of being able to finance a lot of the world, I think people wondered if they have a philosophy that also gets exported along with those investments in all those companies. Do they run these companies in a Chinese way? What is your own view as far as the next entity that really has the opportunity to invest all over the world? Is there a philosophy you\u2019d like to export, but also maybe one that stays at home in Saudi Arabia as well? Ward: There isn\u2019t a philosophy, other than we\u2019ve always intended to be and have been consistent in communicating this \u2013 we\u2019ve been given carte blanche to operate like a true games company, consistent with the values of our industry, what people consider to be important. That\u2019s been true. That was one thing I was pretty alive to when I first thought about the opportunity, because to your point, Chinese companies tend to operate \u2013 not all of them, but they tend to operate in a Chinese way. Western companies operate in a western way. But I can\u2019t say there\u2019s any defining set of values around being a Saudi games company. We\u2019re just trying to be a games company, period. GamesBeat: One interesting data point, maybe, that I was thinking about now. I wrote a profile on this guy named Amir Satvat who works for Amazon. He\u2019s kind of a quant. During the big layoffs that started happening in the fall, he started scraping all the game industry sites for job openings. He aggregated them into a spreadsheet on LinkedIn and made it available for everyone to look at. Here\u2019s all the jobs. He came up with 732 companies and 14,000 jobs that are open. The fun part was that he\u2019s noticed that for the last six weeks or so, that number has been steady. He sees that as a stabilization happening over a relatively short amount of time. Before that openings were tending to go down. Does that mean anything to you, that the collective number of jobs in the game industry is starting to go back up? Ward: I\u2019m not an expert by any stretch. I would anticipate that most of the post-COVID reconciliation of how many users there are, the engagement level and so forth has sorted itself out in terms of how many people we need to meet demand. We should start to be back to business as usual. That\u2019s what I would expect. GamesBeat: There\u2019s AI as well. Nobody knows what that\u2019s going to mean. I talked to a professor a few weeks ago who was saying that we could have a 10% boost to world GDP by 2032 with all the AI advances happening now. That\u2019s $11 trillion. That\u2019s happening. He thinks there\u2019s going to be more change in the next 10 years from AI than in the last 150 years of industrial revolution. One of his guys looked at a typical 2,000-person enterprise and found that jobs in that enterprise would probably be done with one-third to two-thirds fewer people. All these things seem to suggest we\u2019re about to be in another time of change. We thought there was change already in the last few decades, but there\u2019s more coming. Ward: But isn\u2019t that one of the best things about our industry, the constant change and development and evolution of it? I think AI is going to add a lot of jobs. There will be shifting in who does what. Did we need less artists when SpeedTree was introduced? No, we needed more. More tools mean more stuff gets done. That\u2019s the way I view it. GamesBeat's creed when covering the game industry is \"where passion meets business.\" What does this mean?

        "description": "The federal government needs to actively support the domestic manufacturing of critical emerging technologies, rather than merely react after the fact to particular supply chain crises.",
        "content": "During the global semiconductor shortage brought on by the pandemic, many Americans were shocked to learn that of the world\u2019s most sophisticated semiconductor chips are manufactured in Taiwan, which is increasingly menaced by China. Since leading American companies rely on these chips, any sustained disruption in their supply would be disastrous to our economy. In recent decades, financial markets have encouraged such geographical specialization. They have rewarded U.S. companies for outsourcing and offshoring even high-tech manufacturing to countries with lower costs, greater scale, or greater production expertise \u2014 and more generous underpinning all these advantages. Now, with rising geopolitical tensions beginning to fragment global supply chains, it has become clear that the U.S. should have at least some state-of-the-art manufacturing presence in technologies critical to our economy. Fortunately, Congress last year enacted laws designed to revive the domestic production of , as well as and \u2014two other pivotal technologies, whose and are now dominated by China. But these are attempts to recapture manufacturing industries already largely lost. We should not repeat this history with the critical technologies currently emerging from American research laboratories, including quantum technologies, biomanufacturing, and down the road, fusion energy. Because of the groundbreaking research and development conducted by our universities, businesses, and national laboratories, the U.S. consistently generates great ideas for new technologies. But too often the ideas that originate in the U.S. end up being manufactured in other countries. Private investors in the U.S. generally seek out opportunities to earn high returns quickly. The of a is rarely such an opportunity. Prototyping can be expensive and challenging. A production process has to be invented and refined over time. Building or retooling factories can cost , or tens of billions. Massive production scales are needed to cover costs and produce returns. Risks abound. As a result, the U.S. has experienced decades of in manufacturing, leaving us without the ecosystem of talent, expertise, facilities, and suppliers required to steadily bring state-of-the-art products to market. Since advances in often inspire product advances, we have lost a source of . This is not just an economic problem, but also a national security problem: Since the defense market alone is too small to provide the scale required to support state-of-the-art manufacturing in the , our military also depends on commercial manufacturing. It is time to recognize that the U.S. cannot rely solely on private investment to create the kind of manufacturing base that will protect us from geopolitical upheaval. The federal government needs to actively support the domestic manufacturing of critical emerging technologies, rather than merely react after the fact to particular supply chain crises. If instead the U.S. continues playing a catch-up game, we are bound to fall behind China, which intends to dominate global markets in of strategic importance. Given our remarkable culture of innovation in the U.S., we don\u2019t need to mimic China to compete with China. We merely need a keener sense of where and when it is in the national interest for our government to address the systematic underinvestment of private capital in American manufacturing. Our focus should be on incentivizing private investments in the domestic manufacturing of emerging technologies with significant national and economic security implications. If we created a new U.S. government corporation for this purpose \u2014 underwritten by the government but operating independently in selecting the most promising projects for funding \u2014 we could help to de-risk private investment by providing some of the initial patient capital required to prototype a product, build or retool a factory, and scale up. Tax policies could be redesigned to promote such investment. Government procurement contracts could create a market for the new technology. Once a manufacturing company is up, running, and competing, we should leave it to fend for itself. As a country, we are breathtakingly creative in devising new technologies, designs, and services. Now we need to be equally creative on the policy front to ensure that the most important of these technologies \u2014 even those with the most challenging of manufacturing processes \u2014 can be made and scaled here at home. This is the best way to guarantee a reliable supply of critical emerging products, while also helping the U.S. to lead the world in innovation. .",

These growth stock ideas can enhance your portfolio. The post The 3 Best Growth Stocks to Buy Now: September 2023 appeared first on InvestorPlace. More From InvestorPlace ChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires. Here\u2019s How to Get In. The Rich Use This Income Secret (NOT Dividends) Far More Than Regular Investors",
        "content": "Growth stocks tend to be riskier than blue-chip stocks , but investors can reap some of the highest returns with these assets. While growth stocks often get hit hard by market corrections, these are the types of stocks that can double or triple within a few years. Cathie Woods\u2019 growth-centric funds demonstrate how quickly growth stocks can soar and how quickly they can crash. Her funds were among the top performers during the pandemic, but those funds came crashing down in 2022. Those same funds have experienced a resurgence this year due to growth stocks becoming favorable again. You don\u2019t have to invest in high-revenue, high-losses companies to get the growth investor experience. There are plenty of growth stocks with good fundamentals and promising prospects. These are three of the best growth stocks to consider buying. Arista Networks (ANET) Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET ) is a cloud networking company that has more than 8,000 customers and a 19% market share in data centers. Shares trade at a reasonable 36 P/E ratio and have gained over 60% year-to-date. The cloud networking company has rewarded long-term investors with a 192% gain throughout the past five years. Arista Networks got its start by working with financial companies that wanted to enable high-frequency trading for their customers. This start helped the company expand into data centers and early-stage companies. The firm has worked with many large customers, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), VMware (NYSE: VMW ) and Dell (NYSE: DELL ). The company has dozens of products, including Cloud Vision and AI Spine. Cloud Vision helps with workflow automation, while AI Spine enables top-tier AI interconnection which is essential for real-time gaming, virtual reality and metaverse applications. Arista Networks also has a cybersecurity component through its Zero Trust Networking service and recently introduced Cognitive Unified Edge, a product for small businesses. Arista Networks reported 38.7% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter . GAAP net income jumped from $299.1 million in Q2 2022 to $491.9 million in the most recent second quarter. That marks a 64.5% year-over-year gain which makes the stock\u2019s P/E ratio look more justified. Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has been at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom. Shares have more than tripled year-to-date and are up by over 600% throughout the past five years. I have expressed skepticism about Nvidia\u2019s valuation in the past, but the most recent earnings report has made the valuation easier to justify. The stock\u2019s P/E ratio is roughly 120 which is still high, but a few weeks ago, the stock had a 250 P/E ratio. Nvidia doubled its Q2 revenue year-over-year and experienced 843% year-over-year net income growth. That latter metric explains why the stock can become more affordable in the future. Shares only trade at a 47 forward P/E ratio which is justifiable given the company\u2019s incredible growth rate. No investor should expect Nvidia to hold onto these growth rates forever. The company reported $13.5 billion in revenue and $6.2 billion in net income. It\u2019s impossible for net income to grow another 843% year-over-year because net income would have to surpass revenue. Eventually, the growth will slow down because it is unsustainable. Investors should consider how long Nvidia can hold onto these growth rates. If Nvidia continues on this trajectory for another year before retaining moderate growth rates (i.e., respectable double-digit revenue growth), the valuation can be a bargain for investors who buy at the current price. Celsius Holdings (CELH) Most growth stocks are tech companies that tap into innovative concepts. However, some companies buck the trend and give shareholders enticing opportunities. Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH ) investors know first-hand that the best growth stocks aren\u2019t always in the tech sector. The stock has almost doubled year-to-date but is up by an astounding 4,295% throughout the past five years. The energy drink producer reported a 112% year-over-year revenue jump in the second quarter. The company also reported $41 million in net income attributable to common shareholders which represents a 345% year-over-year gain. Celsius Holdings doesn\u2019t have the most attractive valuation, but growth rates and new partnerships make the stock look compelling over the long run. A recent partnership with Pepsi (NYSE: PEP ) can give Celsius Holdings more exposure to international markets. Celsius Holdings has a $15 billion market cap. As the company continues to grow its market share on the back of stupendous revenue and earnings growth, that market cap can become much larger. On this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in ANET, NVDA, and CELH.

        "description": "An inside look from Elon Musk's biographer, Walter Isaacson, reveals Tesla is working on an affordable EV that might resemble the Cybertruck, work as a robotaxi, and cost around $25,000.",
        "content": "Spoiler alert: It's supposed to look like the Cybertruck. We already know about the and the but everyone is eager to hear more about an actually affordable EV from Tesla that would sell for around $25,000. Now we have a better idea, thanks to an report and Elon Musk\u2019s biographer, Walter Isaacson. The report reveals a lot about the messy inner workings of Tesla but also confirms that Tesla making a $25,000 EV that features a like the Cybertruck. Along with the affordable EV, we\u2019ll also see a fully autonomous EV that will be built on the same platform as the $25,000 option. Here are the five major takeaways we learned from what Isaacson divulged to . Tesla previously revealed a conceptual drawing of what a compact EV could look like. TESLA IS MAKING BOTH A $25,000 EV AND A ROBOTAXI Tesla devotees have been waiting for the holy grail of affordable EVs from the company and the report confirms that a $25,000 EV is indeed in the works. The at its starting price of more than $40,000 (before any tax credits), but a Tesla priced around $25,000 would be a lot more accessible. The $25,000 EV was almost scrapped by Musk, according to the report. Isaacson says Musk was so dead set on delivering a robotaxi that he almost ditched plans to make the affordable EV, to instead focus on delivering a fully autonomous electric vehicle. In the end, Tesla execs were able to convince Musk to make this \u201csmall, inexpensive global car\u201d to meet Tesla\u2019s annual growth target. When this $25,000 will be announced and launch is anyone\u2019s guess, though. The very first Cybertruck just rolled off the production line and the Roadster is not expected to start production until the end of 2024. BOTH EVS WILL USE A \u201cNEXT-GEN\u201d PLATFORM To get Musk to agree to build the robotaxi the $25,000 EV, Tesla execs convinced him they could build both EVs using a \u201cnext-generation\u201d engineering platform, according to the report. The plan worked as Musk saw this as an opportunity to build a \u201chigh-speed, ultra-automated\u201d manufacturing process for both EVs. Tesla is already building out its Cybertruck in its headquarters, so there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll see the facility expand to design and manufacture Tesla\u2019s upcoming EVs. This makes even more sense considering both of them will share a similar design. BOTH OF THEM WILL LOOK LIKE THE CYBERTRUCK For those who are still a fan of the Cybertruck look, the good thing is that both of Tesla\u2019s upcoming affordable and autonomous EVs will sport a similar, futuristic look. According to , Tesla\u2019s chief designer, Franz Von Holzhausen, showed models of each EV to Musk in February 2023. Both models will have a similar design to the Cybertruck, with harsh angles, clad in stainless steel, and an almost alien-like look. Upon seeing the concepts, Musk loved them and said that \u201cpeople will think they are seeing something from the future,\u201d according to the report. THE ROBOTAXI WON\u2019T HAVE ANY CONTROLS Just for the robotaxi model, the design would remove steering wheels, mirrors, and pedals to fully embrace an autonomous look. In theory, this design would solely rely on Tesla\u2019s Full-Self Driving tech. Musk did acknowledge the risk in designing it as a \u201cclean robotaxi,\u201d but wanted to go \u201call in on autonomy.\u201d Tesla gave us a look at what a Model 3 looks like without a steering wheel back in 2019. Unfortunately, we\u2019re not sure the public is ready for that. Full-Self Driving has had a spotty history despite being a relatively new technology. There are ways around its safety checks, like using a , and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened looking at fatal accidents where Tesla models were involved. Hopefully, Tesla will have worked out all the kinks by the time its robotaxi releases. YOU COULD MAKE MONEY OFF THE ROBOTAXI It is being referred to as a robotaxi, after all. In the report, Musk says that Tesla owners would earn more than $30,000 by sending out their robotaxis to run errands or offer driverless rides to others. Tesla robotaxi owners would even be able to rent out their EVs on Tesla\u2019s car-sharing network, as back in 2019. That would be one way to recoup the cost of buying the Tesla in the first place.",

You can soon buy shares of Instacart stock on the Nasdaq following Instacart's IPO in September 2023. To buy Instacart stock, set up a brokerage account, research Instacart financials, and come up with an investment strategy. IPO stocks tend to go to institutions and high-net-worth investors first, so retail investors will have to be patient. The end of summer 2023 marks a new beginning for Instacart, as the popular grocery delivery and pick-up service announces that its initial public offering ( IPO ) is scheduled for some point in September 2023. After years of teasing a much-anticipated public offering, the time has finally come, making it one of the most high-profile US listings this year. However, retail investors may still have a hard time buying the stock as IPO shares are often reserved for high-net-worth investors, bankers, hedge funds , and large institutions. Right now, SoFi Invest is the only confirmed brokerage that plans to offer Instacart stock to its users. Here's how you can buy Instacart stock (CART). Learn how to buy shares in some of the largest US tech companies on the market. Here's how to buy Amazon stock and Insider's step-by-step guide on how to buy Apple stock . About the Instacart IPO On August 25, 2023, Instacart officially filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to become a publicly traded company. The business was founded in 2012 and over time has accumulated funding from 37 venture capital firms. The largest investors in Instacart to date have been Sequoia Capital and Capital Partners. The lead underwriters for Instacart's IPO are Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase. As a private company, only venture capitalists and certain high-net-worth individuals have previously been able to get their hands on Instacart shares (aka private equity). The main goal for private equity investors is to \"increase the company's profit from an exit,\" explains Matt Malone, head of investment management at Opto Investments . \"The exit could be an initial public offering (IPO), sale, or other liquidity event. Private equity investors are paid with proceeds from those exits.\" But that's all set to change. Soon retail investors will be able to find Instacart stock on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker \"CART.\" Retail investors are individual investors who use their own funds to buy, sell, and trade assets through brokerages/investment platforms. Not only will Instacart be the most notable US venture-backed tech IPO since December 2021 , but it will also be the first independent grocery delivery business to ever go public. While no one knows for certain how it will all shake out, it has been revealed that Instacart plans to sell $175 million in Series A preferred stock to PepsiCo . SoFi , one of the best robo-advisors , is underwriting Instacart's IPO with plans to offer shares to SoFi users. How to buy Instacart stock 1.

There are several brokerage platforms out there, each with different requirements, limitations, fees, web and mobile access, and resources. Some of the most well-known online brokerages include Charles Schwab , TD Ameritrade , Robinhood , and Interactive Brokers . SoFi Invest is the only brokerage known to hold Instacart shares with the intention of offering stock to its users. Therefore, opening an account with SoFi is not only your best option, but also your only option at this time. Brokerages other than SoFi that will offer Instacart IPO stock are still largely up in the air. You might also get some luck by opening an account with a broker that already offers IPO access. Robinhood, for example, offers IPO access to users through its IPO Access Program. But there's no guarantee that you'll get access to Instacart stock. You may also be able to invest in Instacart through mutual funds , such as Fidelity's Growth Company Fund. Fidelity recently bumped its Instacart Series H shares up 10% at the end of May 2023. 2. Research Instacart financials While investing in a big name like Instacart may sound like a safe investment decision, it's essential that you do your due diligence first and conduct your own research. Although you can't review Instacart's historical stock performance, you can still tune into the company's recent profit history and current market standing. Some key resources to analyze include: Company quarterly earnings reports Income statements Balance sheets After skyrocketing during the COVID-19 pandemic and reaching its peak in Q2 of 2022, Instacart found itself steadily declining as inflation marked up prices on groceries and as people returned to shopping for themselves. Last year, the company cut its valuation multiple times. However, in 2023, Instacart raised its valuation to about $12 billion . Instacart closed 2022 with $428 million in profits. During the first six months of 2023, Instacart reported a profit of $242 million. That's a significant increase compared to what the company earned during the same period the previous year . Despite its recent success, higher grocery prices and economic concerns could hurt Instacart's success in the long run. 3. Determine how much to invest and place an order In general, how much you want to invest depends on your individual investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. It also depends on the price of the shares and how much you're looking to spend. There are four main types of orders you can make when requesting the share price you want: Market order : Orders are immediately executed so that the per-share price currently reflects the stock's current share value. But you can't set the share price before executions, which doesn't make it ideal for investors hoping to bear the stock's current market value. Limit order : You can set a price threshold for shares for buying and selling stock. This is best for investors who want control over how much they are spending on shares. For example, if Instacart stock is trading at $200, and you set your limit order for $150, the brokerage won't complete your order unless the stock's value drops to your limit order price. Stop order : Also called stop-loss order, this order type allows you to set a stop price. That means that if your stock reaches the stop price, it will become a market order and be executed immediately. Stop-limit order : Similar to a stop order, this type of order allows you to establish a set price to stop for your stock's value. But instead of becoming a market order, your order becomes a limit order when your stocks reach the established stock price. But just because you request a certain number of shares doesn't guarantee that you'll get it. As mentioned above, IPO shares tend to be reserved for high-net-worth individuals and intuitions, so retail investors may struggle to get in on the action. Plus, brokers only have a set number of shares available, so you'll have to be patient. 4. Review your purchase and monitor your investment Getting the shares is only the first step in turning a profit. You'll need to implement an investing strategy, such as a buy-and-hold strategy or dollar-cost averaging. This way, you won't be glued to the market hour by hour watching Instacart's stock chart. Here are some common investing strategies: Buy-and-hold : This investment strategy is most appealing to passive and long-term investors. After purchasing a lump sum's worth of Instacart stock, you can sit back and wait for your shares to increase in value over time. You won't cash out until you feel the time is right. Dollar-cost averaging : If you want to regularly contribute to Instacart, this strategy may be a good fit. Instead of purchasing a large sum at once, you can determine how much you're wanting to periodically invest (e.g., $10, $50, $100). As with an investment, no investment is immune to the fluctuations of the stock market. In the event of a struggling economy or a bear market , share prices may drop drastically. Make sure to keep cool and don't make any rash decisions. \"The risk of loss is possibly the greatest risk when investing your money. Diversification can help to mitigate this risk,\" says Gorelick.

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money \u2014 maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice. One such company is M & T Bank, which saw buying by CFO CFO Daryl N. Bible. The Top DividendRank 'ed Stocks With Insider Buying \u00bb Back on June 1, Bible invested $1,206,082.22 into 10,000 shares of MTB, for a cost per share of $120.61. In trading on Friday, bargain hunters could buy shares of M & T Bank and achieve a cost basis 2.3% cheaper than Bible, with shares changing hands as low as $117.82 per share. It should be noted that Bible has collected $1.30/share in dividends since the time of their purchase, so they are currently down 1.2% on their purchase from a total return basis. M & T Bank shares are currently trading +1.63% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of MTB shares, versus its 200 day moving average: MTB DMA tickertech Looking at the chart above, MTB's low point in its 52 week range is $109.36 per share, with $192.56 as the 52 week high point \u2014 that compares with a last trade of $121.28.

        "content": "Warner Bros. Pictures recently released a live-action Barbie movie that featured Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken . Barbie quickly became the year's highest-grossing movie , and not even Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer could stop it. From everything revealed in the trailers , Barbie is unlik anything we've seen before, and it also received some pretty decent reviews. With Barbie grossing over a billion dollars at the box office, some people may be wondering how much toy company Mattel will earn from the box office. While speaking with Yahoo! at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Tech Conference in San Francisco, the CEO of Mattel , Ynon Kreiz, revealed that they will gross $125 million this year, including their portion of Barbie's box office profits. \"It is more than we assumed entering the year, and we expect that in future years there will be continued benefit from the movie. This is about long-term franchise management,\" Kreiz said. \"It's not just about the quarter or the year. It was never about just trying to sell more toys. It was about creating a cultural event, creating a societal moment. And we believe the benefit will carry forward for years to come.\" What is Barbie About? In Barbie, to live in Barbie Land is to be a perfect being in a perfect place. Unless you have a full-on existential crisis. Or you're a Ken. From Oscar-nominated writer/director Greta Gerwig comes Barbie, which hits theaters later this month. Barbie stars Oscar-nominees Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken, alongside America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera, Ariana Greenblatt, Issa Rae, Rhea Perlman, and Will Ferrell. The film also stars Ana Cruz Kayne, Emma Mackey, Hari Nef, Alexandra Shipp, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Simu Liu, Ncuti Gatwa, Scott Evans, Jamie Demetriou, Connor Swindells, Sharon Rooney, Nicola Coughlan, Ritu Arya, Grammy Award-winning singer/songwriter Dua Lipa and Oscar-winner Helen Mirren.
