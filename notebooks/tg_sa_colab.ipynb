              "('The IRS announced it will start targeting thousands of uber-wealthy tax cheats and make them poney up hundreds of millions of dollars in the coming months. The federal agency said it plans to aggressively hunt down 1,600 millionaires and 75 large business partnerships that routinely “cut corners” on their taxes. “If you pay your taxes on time it should be particularly frustrating when you see that wealthy filers are not,” IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel said. Each of the millionaire tax dodgers that the IRS set its sights on owes a minimum of at least $250,000 each in back taxes, while the partnerships have assets of roughly $10 billion on average. The IRS is planning to hire an undisclosed number of revenue agents to focus on the high-end collection cases so that the new initiative can start rolling in October this year. The crackdown represents the next phase of an offensive pursuit that the Biden Administration launched earlier this summer — in July, the IRS said it collected $38 million in delinquent taxes from more than 175 high-income taxpayers in the span of a few months. According to Werfel, the initiative is being propelled by a massive boost in federal funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to generate tax revenue for the nation. The agency is also being added by artificial intelligence tools that can detect tax-cheating tactics that might be indiscernible to the human eye. “New tools are helping us see patterns and trends that we could not see before, and as a result, we have higher confidence on where to look and find where large partnerships are shielding income,” Werfel said. A team of academic economists and IRS researchers in 2021 found that the top 1% of U.S. income earners fail to report more than 20% of their earnings to the IRS. With additional support and funding, the IRS will continue to hunt larger and wealthier tax dodgers in the coming years. As part of the initiative, the agency promised that citizens earning less than $400,000 a year will not see an increase in their audit rates. “This new compliance push makes good on the promise of the Inflation Reduction Act to ensure the IRS holds our wealthiest filers accountable to pay the full amount of what they owe,” said Werfel. “The years of underfunding that predated the Inflation Reduction Act led to the lowest audit rate of wealthy filers in our history.” With Post Wires',\n",

              "'With concerns of a recession — or stock market crash — in full swing, next week’s Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) report represents perhaps the single most important economic data release ahead of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy decision. Indeed, the CPI report may offer insight into whether the Fed’s war on inflation is coming to a soft or emergency landing. After a surprising increase in prices in July, economists are crossing their fingers that price growth cooled in August. The headline CPI rose 3.2% on an annual basis in July, the first acceleration in more than a year. July’s hotter-than-expected inflation has stoked fears that the Fed may push the rate hike button again soon. As such, next week’s CPI report may force the Fed’s hand at its next policy meeting, Sept. 19-20. With just days between the August CPI and the FOMC meeting, the inflation data will likely prove Fed members’ final consideration before coming to a decision. And what a decision it will be. Even with fears of an imminent economic pullback eating up Wall Street, members of the Fed still aren’t satisfied with the current 5.5% benchmark rate. At the annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted that rates are liable to remain elevated — or even increase — in the foreseeable future. “We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective,” he said. Recession Indicators Loom Large The major concern here is that should inflation come in higher than expected, the Fed may be pressed to raise rates yet again, a possibility that further aggravates recessionary tension in in the U.S. economy. Now, the soft-landers will argue that metrics like unemployment and consumer spending, which typically deteriorate during a recession, have been surprisingly resilient. Which has been true, at least, until recently. Indeed, the latest jobs report showed a surprising 0.3% increase in unemployment, to 3.8%, the highest level since February 2022. While this is still historically fairly strong, it also offers some validity to those suggesting an interest rate-induced recession is on the way. “The labor market is clearly cooling, with job openings falling and job growth slowing closer to sustainable levels based on the most recent data, but remains tight,” said Goldman Sachs’ Joseph Briggs . While 3.8% unemployment isn’t itself bad, it’s the suggestion that it may just be the start of a wider, more malicious downturn that has economists and analysts terrified. There’s some data that suggest that consumer spending has largely been propped up by savings and debt expenditures. In fact, credit card debt recently hit $1 trillion for the first time in history. Will the CPI Cause a Stock Market Crash? The fear is that a red-hot inflation report will invite more rate hikes, which will likely invite a slowdown in hiring, which will, in itself, invite a reversal in spending. When consumer spending falls, so do earnings. And when earnings crash, well, so does the wider stock market. The notion that the economy hasn’t fully digested the full brunt of the Fed’s previous rate hikes is an even more terrifying suggestion, given the overwhelming expectation that the central bank isn’t done raising rates yet. Should everything hit all at once, the notion of a soft landing quickly devolves into an emergency landing as the economy slips into recession.

            " Sentiment: \"Positive\" for Considering how markets are extremely sensitive to US data at the moment, it is best to be prepared for more potential landmines to come before we get to the next FOMC meeting later this month.

        "  Visualizing sentiment analysis results can provide valuable insights into the sentiment distribution of a dataset. Several data visualization techniques are commonly used to represent sentiment outputs:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Bar Charts and Histograms:** These are simple and effective for showing sentiment distribution. Each sentiment category (positive, negative, neutral) is represented as a bar, and the height of the bar corresponds to the frequency or percentage of each sentiment in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Pie Charts:** Pie charts can show the proportion of each sentiment class in the dataset. Each sentiment category is represented as a slice of the pie, with the size of the slice corresponding to its relative frequency.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Line Charts:** Line charts can be used to visualize changes in sentiment over time, especially in time-series data. For example, you can track how sentiment towards a product or topic evolves over weeks or months.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Heatmaps:** Heatmaps can show sentiment distribution across different categories or topics. Rows and columns represent categories or topics, and each cell's color intensity indicates the sentiment strength or frequency.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Scatter Plots:** Scatter plots can be used when sentiment scores are continuous or have a range. Each data point represents a document or text, and the x-axis can represent one sentiment score (e.g., positive), while the y-axis represents another (e.g., negative).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Word Clouds:** Word clouds visually display the most frequent words in a text corpus. You can create separate word clouds for positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, with word size indicating word frequency.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Stacked Bar Charts:** Stacked bar charts show the composition of sentiment within different categories or topics. Each bar is divided into segments, and each segment represents a sentiment category.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Sentiment Timeline:** This type of visualization plots sentiment scores over time, showing how sentiment fluctuates. It can be useful for tracking public sentiment on social media or news articles.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Box Plots and Violin Plots:** These plots show the distribution of sentiment scores, including measures such as median, quartiles, and outliers. They are particularly useful for comparing sentiment across different groups or categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Chord Diagrams:** Chord diagrams represent relationships between sentiment categories or topics. The thickness of the chords connecting categories indicates the strength of the relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **Network Graphs:** Network graphs can be used to visualize co-occurrence relationships between words or entities within different sentiment categories. Nodes represent words or entities, and edges represent co-occurrence relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **Geospatial Maps:** If sentiment analysis is applied to data with geographical information, you can visualize sentiment distribution on maps. Different regions or countries can be colored based on the predominant sentiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice of visualization depends on the nature of your data, the research questions you want to answer, and the audience you want to communicate with. Often, a combination of these visualization types can provide a comprehensive view of sentiment analysis results.\n",
